The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09019: Furthermore, at the time of this study, we did not possess high-resolution, geocoded food outlets data that are typically used for mapping food deserts [57] .\n\ns_09069: Similar studies were done to create a QuikSCAT climatology of storm sizes for the 34-kt radius and outer-core strength (OCS) intensity [34] [35] [36] .\n\ns_09119: The challenge for predicting conversion is to combine these heterogeneous data sources, some of which are high-dimensional (MRI and PET) and some low-dimensional (clinical, CSF, APOE carrier), by selecting features that optimally weight the relative contribution from each modality.\n\ns_09169: This chapter provides details on the contents of the restricted-use BPS:12/17 files, processing of the survey data files, statistical imputations, and creation of derived variables.\n\ns_09219: Table 2 shows reduced pesticide use is also evident with Bt cotton\uf8e7on average, a reduction of between 1.3 and 3.4 pesticide sprays per acre per season.\n\ns_09269: Further, the large amount of heterogeneity and skewness in the activity intensity curves (Figure 2A-D) indicates that using cutpoints and means to define the data rather than robust approaches, such as medians and quantiles, may lead to spurious results.\n\ns_09319: Thus, the quantitative automatic analysis with the aid of the new parameters adds some extra diagnostic power to the version discussed in ref.\n\ns_09369: In the case of FreeSurfer, the TIV (called intracranial volume in the FreeSurfer 5.1.0 documentation), total GM, and hippocampus and ventricular volumes were read directly from the asegstats output file.\n\ns_09419: Table 1 Characteristics of study population overall and by number of aortic segments with apparent calcification.\n\ns_09469: Further studies with more sequences are needed to determine the distribution of this variant in Turkey and tracing the origin of this strain.\n\ns_09519: Sample types for RT-PCR include nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs.\n\ns_09569: Finally, Helson and Kwan presented data indicating small increases in openness, with some contradictory evidence across cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.\n\ns_09619: This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, daily activities, and state FE in columns 3 through 6, respectively.\n\ns_09669: Our second contribution is to adopt novel feature reduction scheme, such as sparse coding and max-pooling [14] , which improves the efficiency and efficacy of the performance using high-dimensional cortical thickness on a variety of AD diagnosis tasks.\n\ns_09719: This reduced the sample to 3,743 participants.\n\ns_09769: Because similarity is measured through correlation, we chose to measure the similarity between 2 regions as the mean correlation between the series of any 2 voxels, each belonging to a different region.\n\ns_09819: 10 : The \"guess and check\" and \"organize data in a table\" strategies.\n\ns_09869: Despite the many advantages of joint modeling, the standard forms suffer from limitations that arise from a fixed model specification and computational difficulties when applied to large datasets.\n\ns_09919: A number of recent papers have developed models in which the prospect of emigration increases the expected return to human capital investment (see e.g., Beine et al.\n\ns_09969: Based on the findings of the study there is evidence that challenges the assumption of the current administration regarding the effectiveness of monetary incentives to reduce the poor test results of low-income students [3] [4] [5] .\n\ns_00021: Researchers with smaller amounts of data are Fig.\n\ns_00071: The difference in degrees of freedom using a \u03c7 2 (0.50) distribution was used to determine whether the inclusion of a covariate resulted in a statistically significant improvement (Pedhazur, 1997) .\n\ns_00121: Our multivariate analyses used important domains of variables identified in the bivariate analyses to examine whether they explained why having a teenage father compromises children's early development.\n\ns_00171: Furthermore, state-of-the-art registration studies on high-quality, high-resolution MRI modalities have reported at most a ventricle average Dice score of 0.9 [7, 23] .\n\ns_00221: However, it must be mentioned that such information is sensitive to manual data processing errors, and that ex post health authorities may submit the records to modifications and changes."
