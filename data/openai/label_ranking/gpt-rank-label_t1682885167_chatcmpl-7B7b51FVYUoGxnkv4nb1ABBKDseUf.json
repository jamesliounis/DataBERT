The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02609: This situation changed in 2000 following publication of the results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) [74] , showing that the use of those drugs could cause heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\ns_02659: Also, several non-pharmacological intervention in subjects with MCI (Baker et al., 2010) or dementia (Woods et al., 2009; Schaub et al., 2018) have shown cortisol lowering effects.\n\ns_02709: Confidentiality requirements prevent a more disaggregated presentation.\n\ns_02759: Consequently, the amount of young forest (<16 years) has been combined with the area of open land as part of standard hydrologic assessments within Wisconsin Great Lakes watersheds (WI Lake Superior Basin Partner Team 2007).\n\ns_02809: We fitted 2 sets of models: 1) estimating the mutually adjusted independent associations of GA (early preterm, moderate preterm, late preterm, and early term compared with full term (referent)) and household SES (quintiles, with the highest SES quintile as the referent) with each outcome; and 2) adding terms for interaction between GA and household SES (e.g., early preterm \u00d7 SES quintile 1).\n\ns_02859: In this way, path analysis is an appropriate answer to our research questions, since in path analysis, mediated pathways or indirect effects can be examined (Ullman and Bentler 2003) .\n\ns_02909: Respondent Assistance: We were only contacted by eight respondents throughout the data collection period.\n\ns_02959: McKnight, et al., 1987. science, however, there is less concentration in any one area.\n\ns_03009: In Ukraine, monitoring is conducted \"to identify and track trends in the quality of education\u2026; establishment of conformity of actual results of educational activity with the stated goals, estimation of degree and reasons of deviations from the goals\" (Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, 2019).\n\ns_03059: Starting from year 2 onward, the NA-ADNI MagPhan \u00ae phantom was circulated among all I-ADNI sites to measure post-hoc inter-scanner signal repeatability.\n\ns_03109: The effect of having some technical assistance is slightly lower with an impact of about a factor of two.\n\ns_03159: Finally, in columns (5) and (6) we look at the in \u2021uence of the presence of the BDO in the meetings.\n\ns_03209: A glance at Figure 10 reveals that the wheat price spikes in the 1970s and in 2007/08 occurred when world stock-to-use ratios were low.\n\ns_03259: In the second strand of the trade literature, Harrigan [17] provides the first empirical test of the factor proportions theory in a framework that accounts for international technology differences.\n\ns_03309: Bank data comes from the latest available balance sheet before June 30, 2007 from the Bankscope database.\n\ns_03359: To derive our indicators, we not only collect the WEF variables used by WMO and newly defined WEF variables 6 , but also incorporate recent indicators from other sources available for at least the period 2003-07.\n\ns_03409: Yet, it seems that the 'network' analysis combined with a broader discussion of development in trade in parts provides a pretty good yardstick to gauge the significance of trade related to this finer division of labor.\n\ns_03459: Table 3 presents the nonlinear least squares estimates of the parameters in equations (20) and (21) .\n\ns_03509: More recent papers (such as Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Feyen, and Levine, 2011) have come closer to recognizing that banks and markets play different roles at different stages of economic development, that is, that form might also matter.\n\ns_03559: Section 4 describes the data, while section 5 presents descriptive statistics on job flows and decompositions of aggregate productivity growth.\n\ns_03609: Our paper is related to this strand of literature, but our focus is not on quantifying systemic risk of large financial institutions but rather to examine time series trends for a large cross-section of banks.\n\ns_03659: This -shock\u2016 of the economic transformation of a large number of developing countries meant that the previous equilibrium whereby developing countries were left out of the GATT process needed to be revisited.\n\ns_03709: There exists also some empirical evidence that returns of infrastructure investments in advanced countries tend to be particularly high if these investments complete a network that is already sufficiently developed.\n\ns_03759: WHO data show that 47% of diagnosed asthma suffers in India come from the lowest two income quintiles, 9 so that the number of disadvantaged beneficiaries is 551,481 x 47% = 259,196 people.\n\ns_03809: Consequently, we take as our dependent variable the mid-closing spread of the 2013 Ras Gas bond yield over the 10 year benchmark US Treasury yield."
