The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01657: The methods that Llad\u00f3 et al.\n\ns_01707: A risk-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent relationship of reported disease and patient characteristics with OS and DSS.\n\ns_01757: Since Groups 1, 3 and 4 contain observed values of X m (2) and covariates in Source 2 or 3, G(2) = {1, 3, 4} and M 2 = 3.\n\ns_01807: Specifically, in Tables 2 and 3 , we found that income inequality and social capital became non-significant determinants of mortality when using a spatial filtering approach, which contradicts several recent studies using other analytical techniques, such as spatial econometrics and weighted least squares modeling [7, 9, 55, 78] .\n\ns_01857: Substantial effort was made to construct these variables so that they had minimal missing data and were comparable between the two data sets.\n\ns_01907: Plasma and CSF samples are collected in the individual clinical cores as described previously [33, 34] .\n\ns_01957: Table 1 displays the key sociodemographic characteristics across both the overall sample (N = 1989) and by each nation.\n\ns_02007: A multiple R of .55 was revealed with an adjusted R 2 of .29 (F(2.112) = 24.27, p < .0001).\n\ns_02057: The sensitivity of reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 is 3 times higher than that of RT-qPCR in a comparative analysis of 194 clinical pharyngeal swab specimens.\n\ns_02107: For the most part, the available data encompassed 10-15-year periods between 1996 and 2011, with the exception of the national Costa Rica registry .\n\ns_02157: provides researchers a wider scope to share their scholarly publications.\n\ns_02207: Recent study has shown that incident dementia risk is higher among older persons who decline in both cognition and gait.\n\ns_02240: Baseline distributions of study variables were compared for patients with MCI who converted and who did not convert to AD in the 3-year study ( Table 2) .\n\ns_02290: The landcover indications on these maps were interpreted to match landcover classes described by the 2011 National Land Cover Dataset [Homer et al., 2015] for comparison to other scenarios in this study.\n\ns_02340: The dependent variable was the mean FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratio for a given ROI.\n\ns_02390: 700 Whitney, M. M., Jia, Y., & McManus, P. M. (2014).\n\ns_02440: Through this method of patient attribution, perhaps this study adds to the evidence for the value of primary care in providing comprehensive, high value, evidence-based care.\n\ns_02490: The majority of sequences corresponded to data obtained from December 2019 to July 2020.\n\ns_02540: Future research can investigate additional instruments and controls (such as lagged income) to account for potential endogeneity, but these lagged values may require panel survey data or the addition of new questions to the OFRF survey.\n\ns_02590: For example, the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance is widely described in literature [21] [22] [23] .\n\ns_02640: In a study of the same research group, involving 456 elderly non-demented subjects, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been found to be linked to cognitive impairment, but the relationship did not appear to be mediated by diurnal cortisol levels (HabaRubio et al., 2018) .\n\ns_02690: While it is between-group convergence that is the focus of our analysis, most current estimates of the intergenerational transmission of income derive from samples of blacks and whites, and assume no distinction between within-group and between-group parameters.\n\ns_02740: Sources of error include errors (which are not yet well documented) associated with each land cover classification, registration errors and the ambiguity associated with each land cover class definition and temporal differences in the imagery used for the classification.\n\ns_02790: Presence of additive interaction was assessed by testing statistical significance of the set of interaction terms using the generalized score test statistic, by plotting modelpredicted scores by GA and socioeconomic quintile at mean covariate values, and by examining associations between preterm birth and each outcome after stratifying by socioeconomic quintile.\n\ns_02840: The model was tested using standardized coefficients obtained with maximum-likelihood method of estimation."
