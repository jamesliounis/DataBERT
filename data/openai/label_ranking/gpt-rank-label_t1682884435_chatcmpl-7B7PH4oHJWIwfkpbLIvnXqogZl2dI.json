The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02841: Similarly, this procedure was recommended by researchers comparing it to other replication methods when testing them using the same data set (Stapleton 2008) .\n\ns_02891: We plan to perform additional analyses on the MPWEB data in the near future.\n\ns_02941: In this analysis, data from both the student and the teacher components of the survey were used.\n\ns_02991: In scientific sources, the term \"monitoring\" is defined as a system of ongoing, interim and summary evaluation (Mertens, 2009, pp.\n\ns_03041: Test-retest scanning sessions were acquired from a group of 9 volunteers (56% male and 44% female, mean age 42 \u00b1 18 years).\n\ns_03091: The study found that operator educational level and conservation technical assistance have a significant and positive relationship with participation in multifunctional activities on rice farms.\n\ns_03141: The two methods yield very similar results, and in the paper we will base our results on the keyword-searched topics.\n\ns_03191: First consider the evidence about the behavior over the past few years of aggregate food price, which was less variable than the prices of many of its components, including food grains in particular.\n\ns_03241: The author employs manufacturing outputs and factor endowments data for up to 20 OECD countries during 1970-1985.\n\ns_03291: Cassola, Hortacsu, and Kastl (2009) use bidding data from the European Central Bank (ECB) auctions for one-week loans to study how the bidding schedule of banks changes during the crisis and how these changes relate to ex-post bank performance.\n\ns_03341: Second, column 2 reports estimates when TF indicators are instrumented by their 3-year lagged value to reduce the bias that may arise from potential reverse causality.\n\ns_03391: Analyses pointing to a rapidly increasing level of processing in goods traded by CEEC would suggest that parts and components has been the engine of growth of their trade-see among others Aturupane, Djankov and Hoekman (1998) , Baldone, Lasagni and Sdogati (1997, Dobrinsky (1995) and Kaminski, Wang and Winters (1996) .\n\ns_03441: The likelihood ratio test indicates that the maintained hypothesis H 01 : b 1 = b 2 is not rejected at the 5 percent level in all three temporal cross-sections (1982, 1987, and 1992 1;426 = 3:86 and the probabality level at which a standard F-test rejects the restriction is .78; for 1992, F = :18 < F :95\n\ns_03491: Scale effects are measured by the coefficient of population size in the workhorse regression.\n\ns_03541: Row C aggravates such sample selection bias by excluding firms with, respectively, fewer than 30 (columns 1 and 2) and 50 (columns 3 and 4) employees and defining a firm as having exited when it either disappears from the data altogether or fails to report having more than, respectively, 29 or 49 employees in any of the subsequent years.\n\ns_03591: We follow Campbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi (2008) and Hillegeist et al.\n\ns_03641: In fact, in the bid to bring the larger developing countries into the fold through the -single-undertaking,\u2016 a large number of small and poor countries were also swept up -a form of -democratic overshooting\u2016 that we return to in the conclusion.\n\ns_03691: As can be seen in Table 2 , low-income countries import more power generatingequipment from China than from the United States.\n\ns_03741: Table 7 summarizes By this measure, the poor are overrepresented among the beneficiaries of SE litigation, in cases with expected progressive effects, by a factor of around 2 to 1.\n\ns_03791: Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, we relate Ras Gas credit spreads to their own lags, to current and lagged Kepco credit spreads, to a crude oil reference price used to settle LNG sales (13rent), Korean control variables, and the current and lagged returns on four regional emerging debt market indices (contagion and spillover effects) in a linear regression framework.\n\ns_03841: Table 5 presents the results of regressions that relate a participant's tendency to be consistent or \"present\"-biased to observable characteristics.\n\ns_03891: To estimate the health effects of indoor air pollution from the odds ratios in Table 5 .1, baseline data for ARI and COPD need to be established.\n\ns_03941: As reported in Table 1 , the estimated coefficients have the expected signs and they are mostly statistically significant.\n\ns_03991: These results are presented in Panel B of Table 15 .\n\ns_04041: I am grateful to Abbas Bhuiya for providing me with the group sizes, which were not reported in the original article, to construct the concentration curves, concentration indices, and averages reported inFigure 14andTable 8."
