The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02473: All code used in this study is available on github (see Data/Code availability).\n\ns_02523: These results reinforce the findings reported by Dinar, Karagiannis, and Tzouvelekas (2007) that the provision of information services should be targeted based on socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and physical characteristics of the farm operation.\n\ns_02573: Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 14.0 software for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\ns_02623: Methods: Review of the literature.\n\ns_02673: The first section of this paper\n\ns_02723: ISSN: 1463-4988 print / 1539-4077 online DOI: 10.1080/14634988.2011.628242 (Peckham et al., 2006).\n\ns_02773: Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\n\ns_02823: 2005) and was used in this study.\n\ns_02873: Disclaimer and Acknowledgments: This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken by Census Bureau staff.\n\ns_02923: The statistical comparison in this report were based cm the t statistic.\n\ns_02973: application was used to analyze the answers.\n\ns_03023: All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 12.0.\n\ns_03073: Table 1 provides a list of all these variables from the literature reviewed for the present study.\n\ns_03123: A similar result was found by Chattopadhyay and Du \u2021o(2004b) In Table 10 we examine the e\u00a4ect of individual characteristics on the likelihood of a decision being reached with regards to one's preferred topic.\n\ns_03173: 12 The first paper to pose the solution to this problem in a modern analytical fashion is Williams (1936) .\n\ns_03223: This is presented in the following sections.\n\ns_03273: This paper relates to several strands of literature.\n\ns_03323: Source: Authors' calculations.\n\ns_03423: 14 The inferences drawn from the 1982, 1987, and 1992 temporal cross-sections are supported by the pooled data.\n\ns_03473: 16 The data are from FinStats 2009, a world-wide financial database put together by the World Bank, which covers 40 key financial indicators for the period 1980-2008 (coverage quality varies between variables).\n\ns_03523: The next section reviews related literature and describes the context.\n\ns_03573: Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) , Huang, Zhou, and Zhou (2009) , Chan-Lau and Gravelle (2005), Avesani et al.\n\ns_03623: In each of these regressions, the coefficient on the dummy for the UK (1870), US (1975) , and China (2008) yields the magnitude of over-trading or under-trading for the relevant country.\n\ns_03673: See, for example,Irving and Manroth 2009."
