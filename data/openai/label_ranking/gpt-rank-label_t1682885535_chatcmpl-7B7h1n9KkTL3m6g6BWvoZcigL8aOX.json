The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09444: Predictors of AC were assessed by logistic regression, and the role of BMD using mediation analysis.\n\ns_09494: These authors found that HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication but no CPE was observed, suggesting that both Vero cell types support amplification and replication of SARS-CoV-2 but that Vero E6 cells are more suitable for amplification and quantification [42] .\n\ns_09544: An outbreak of highly infectious novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China which rapidly spread across worldwide and was later declared pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 [1] .\n\ns_09594: Furthermore, there are now a number of clear empirical cases where it has been demonstrated that rank-order consistency and mean-level change coexist in the same longitudinal study (Haan et al., 1986; Mortimer, Finch, & Kumka, 1982; Roberts, Helson, & Klohnen, 2002; Robins et al., 2001) .\n\ns_09644: This is done both to increase the precision of estimated gender and SES gaps and to control for potentially confounding omitted variables.\n\ns_09694: Since cortical thickness estimation algorithm generates high dimensional features, some feature reduction algorithms are usually applied before classification.\n\ns_09744: An average mathematics achiever with a science-related career expectation has a higher probability of earning a baccalaureate degree in the physical sciences or engineering than a high mathematics achiever with a nonscience career expectation, 34% versus 19%.\n\ns_09794: (3) For the classification, we use SVM for classifiers to replace SoftMax in last layer of BP network because SVM has prominent advantages in solving the problem of identifying small samples.\n\ns_09844: The most success was in response to problem 1.\n\ns_09894: For notational convenience, we drop the subscript i for variables in this section, noting that the network is only applied to trajectories from one patient at time.\n\ns_09944: 20 The key to identifying such losses is that we consider the skilled emigration in total with the initial wage as our reference point rather than taking each emigrant one-by-one taking previous emigration as given.\n\ns_09994: Building data systems that measure student growth and success, and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction.\n\ns_00046: Much of the imaging data in NDAR comes from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (Brain Development Cooperative Group 2006), but there are images from 270 subjects with ASD, as well.\n\ns_00096: Prior research has corroborated the importance of such programs for increasing secondary students' interest in science careers by providing them with close mentorship and hands-on experience with authentic scientific endeavors (Stake and Mares, 2001; Winkleby et al., 2009; Sadler et al., 2010) .\n\ns_00146: Household SES was constructed by ECLS-B from the primary parent interview and includes household income and the mother's and father's or resident partner's education and occupational prestige.\n\ns_00196: The average Dice score on this structure was 0.236 for SparseVM and 0.231 for VoxelMorph.\n\ns_00246: Nine months after the first infections, after more than 52.6 million infections worldwide and more than 1.29 million deaths worldwide.\n\ns_00293: This study and many other MCI studies employed relatively short test batteries.\n\ns_00343: The main aim of the study, however, was to evaluate the association between sex hormones levels and osteoporosis rather than overtime changes during aging (Table 2) .\n\ns_00393: However, besides nominal cost savings associated with reduced water use, WSIN installations showed that soil moisture and other data resulted in significant reductions in input use, which produced significant revenue increases associated with improved crop growth and yields.\n\ns_00443: For the LC cohort, using either cerebellar cortex or brain stem as the reference region, longitudinal MCSUVR change was not significant without partial volume, while PVC revealed the change (Table 4 ).\n\ns_00493: Let be the response of examinee r to item i, and let\n\ns_00543: Collectively, temperature and precipitation comprised 32% of the top ten variables across the 31 species, although they were 58% of the available predictor variables.\n\ns_00593: Thanks to the revolution begun by the Human Genome Project, what had seemed an insuperable problem has begun to yield rapidly to modern genomic technologies being brought to bear on specific disorders by large global consortia.\n\ns_00685: Satellite observed surface salinity for 2012 from Aquarius (Level 3, V2.0) [Lagerloef, 2012] shows a similar extent and seasonal cycle as the model (Figure 3b)."
