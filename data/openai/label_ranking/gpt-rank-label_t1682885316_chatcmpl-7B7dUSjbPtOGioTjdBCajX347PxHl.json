The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05313: It can be shown that enrollment is maximized if a state is allocated an amount that is proportional to its enrollment elasticity with respect to federal education spending.\n\ns_05363: 3 This \"vulnerability\" effect may, in fact, explain some conflicting results in the empirical literature that examines international transmission of shocks.\n\ns_05413: The results from the ex post simulation indicate that the rapid consumption methodology can reliably estimate consumption and poverty.\n\ns_05463: To measure FDI regulations across countries, we use the Investing Across Borders data set, which compares FDI laws and regulations across 87 economies.\n\ns_05513: Second, the paper presents the results from pilot data collected in four countries: Chile, Ghana, India, and Vietnam.\n\ns_05563: It was pioneered by Handel (2008) , who developed and used the STAMP survey (that later became the PDII), for the US.\n\ns_05613: \uf0b7 Under RCP8.5 emission scenarios, 9 out of 11 climate models are in complete agreement of a net increase in plant exposure numbers and user impacts for all flood exceedance probabilities in the near future.\n\ns_05663: Por lo que se refiere al soporte com\u00fan, en las figuras C2.3 y C2.4 se muestra como una vez realizado el pareamiento, se logra un importante soporte com\u00fan para el puntaje de propensi\u00f3n estimado, al traslaparse las distribuciones del puntaje entre los grupos de intervenci\u00f3n y el de comparaci\u00f3n.\n\ns_05713: -Level 3 cards: These are used for purchases made within the framework of registered public markets.\n\ns_05763: First-stage results for all robustness checks show significant correlations between the instruments and the value of Indonesian exports and its interaction with the technology variables.Tables are available upon request.\n\ns_05813: Columns (1)-(6) present results for the BDM sample, and Columns (7)-(9) for the TIOLI sample.\n\ns_05863: Overall, the evidence from Dhaka suggests that these three information sources should be viewed as complements rather than substitutes.\n\ns_05913: China and India developed in the past 20 years, during which its linkage rates with the other regions also increased albeit by far smaller amounts, as shown in Figure 10 .\n\ns_05963: This paper brings these aspects in the literature together extending these studies to analyze the use of the euro in producer currency pricing and as a vehicle currency by EMU and non-EU European exporters in trading with a developing country and implications for ERPT and TPT.\n\ns_06013: Within a framework commonly used in the literature to assess the determinants of general ICT access and usage, this paper examines three sets of determining factors behind mobile internet adoption: (1) physical infrastructure (coverage by a 3G or above mobile network, and electricity access); (2) socioeconomic factors such as gender, income level, location (urban/rural), education level, price of mobile data packages, price of internet-enabled phones, and so on; and (3) perspective factors shaped by the institutional environment, culture, and network effects.\n\ns_06063: These studies rely on surveys based on self-assessed measures of one's capacity to deal with \u2026nancial shocks, regardless of whether the source of funds is the respondent's own assets, capacity to borrow, a network of family and friends, or something else (e.g., Johnson and Widdows, 1985; Worthington, 2004; Lusardi et al., 2011; Vandone et al., 2011; Brunetti et al., 2016) .\n\ns_06113: There are advantages and disadvantages of both of these data sources.\n\ns_06163: The 2012 round is therefore advantageous for our analysis as it oversampled areas with high migration rates, which allows us to have a larger sample on migrants and to better disentangle the effect of illegality.\n\ns_06213: These questions were sourced directly from a combination of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy surveys that the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO had undertaken in PNG or in other low-and middle-income countries.\n\ns_06263: Following Jolliffe and Prydz (2021) we regress harmonized national poverty lines on median values of consumption (or income, depending on the welfare aggregate used in the country).\n\ns_06313: In the survey, we asked the household head details about 20 different types of assets they held.\n\ns_06363: The data set includes a variable that by means of 62 different values details the relationship between the individual and the head of the household.\n\ns_06413: 14 As measure of eort, they use the sterilized residual from the regression of the residual squared (the residual from the earlier stage) on circumstances.\n\ns_06463: The results as shown in Figure 6 reveal interesting trends in the responses to the subsidy.\n\ns_06513: These variables are now likely capturing most of the effect that was previously attributed to employment."
