The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08733: The corresponding skill assessment software has been developed to compute the skill assessment scores using data files containing observed and modelled variables.\n\ns_08783: 5,[22][23][24][25][26] This unexpected finding could be influenced by the extensive community-based participatory research capacity that the states only academic medical center (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) had invested in to better engage rural and minority participants.\n\ns_08833: After having assessed the robustness of the visualization method, we applied it to better understand the factors influencing the training process of the CNN classifier based on several scenarios: for different folds (different initialization, different training/validation split) and different runs (different initialization, same training/validation split).\n\ns_08883: Hence, we found that young people deployed their optimism and the related belief in hard work in different ways: for some, it was a reflection of their privileged access to opportunities, while for the most disadvantaged, it was an 'anchor of hope'.\n\ns_08933: 1999 , Dewdney 2000 , Hubbell 2001 ).\n\ns_08983: Russian scientists have also developed empirical or statistical models that take into consideration wind speed and the local topography in predicting breakup dates [Gudkovich, 1995].\n\ns_09033: Upon including this organizational environment factor, the significant effect of the racial aspect of the social environment on the school's open campus policy holding that was evident in Model 1 goes away (Model 2; OR = 4.801; 95% CI = 0.490 to 47.015).\n\ns_09083: A recent study based on TRMM rain datasets for landfall TCs over different parts of China presents various rainfall patterns relative to TC's motion at different times of landfall [79] .\n\ns_09133: If we denote the Gram matrix of momenta by G S and that of 3D-SSP by G P , the fused Gram matrix for the product space weighted by \u03b7 can be written as:\nThe projection scores, thus obtained by PLS, have combined information of anatomical shape and glucose metabolic activity that is used as features together with low-dimensional modalities such as genetic biomarkers of APOE carrier status and/or CSF biomarker available from spinal tap tests.\n\ns_09183: 26 StudentTracker data were requested toward the end of data collection to ensure availability of the most up-to-date student identifying data for the match.\n\ns_09233: They examined the sensitivity of their results to the supply shift assumptions and found that the magnitude of the shift for any region can have a large impact on the size and distribution of the welfare changes.\n\ns_09283: Health conditions were generally more prevalent in the older age groups, especially history of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and anemia (Table 1) .\n\ns_09333: We also performed a leaveone-out cross validation to see which parameters were most useful for the diagnosis.\n\ns_09383: The 3 T dataset alone appeared too small to serve as a basis for meaningful statistical comparisons between morphometry methods.\n\ns_09433: To better understand the meaning of this quadratic relationship, Model 1 was run separately for participants with BMI \u226425 kg/m 2 (normal), BMI 25-30 kg/m 2 (overweight) and BMI>30 kg/m 2 (obesity) 6 .\n\ns_09483: Our results are in agreement with the previous reports showing that SARS-CoV replicated efficiently and caused CPE in Vero and MA-104 cell lines [44] [45] [46] [47] .\n\ns_09533: Phylogenetic and alignment study of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V identified several mutations and related amino acid changes and majority were distributed over spike protein [22] .\n\ns_09583: The structure of the data necessitated several levels of aggregation to ensure that the effect size estimates were independent.\n\ns_09633: Similarly, age is one of the most important predictors of children's time use (Zick & Bryant, 1996) , so respondent's age is included in the time-use regressions.\n\ns_09683: After we compute these patches, sparse coding combined with max-pooling [14] are applied for cortical thickness feature dimension reduction.\n\ns_09733: Although our current analysis does not provide proof of an uninterrupted causal chain of influence, our study does suggest that to attract students into the sciences and engineering, we should pay close attention to children's early exposure to science at the middle and even younger grades.\n\ns_09783: Young 11 et al proposed building an AD versus NC classifier using a Gaussian process, which was then used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters.\n\ns_09833: A review of the existing literature reveals many different problem-solving strategies identified by researchers, including guess and check, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make a drawing (visual representation), work backwards, organize data in a table or list, use arithmetic operations, use logical reasoning, use symmetry, use a model, use a formula, and solve an equation (NCTM, 2000; Polya, 1997; Posamantier and Krulik, 1998) .\n\ns_09883: Effective clinical decision support often involves the dynamic forecasting of medical conditions based on clinically relevant variables collected over time.\n\ns_09933: The tension between the costs and benefits of skilled emigration for an industry that relies heavily on outsourced business comes out clearly in a recent paper by Gene\nGrossman and Elhanan Helpman (Grossman and Helpman 2002) ."
