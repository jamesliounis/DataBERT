The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09117: Corresponding statistical maps of Z-scores, p i (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N), are generated in comparison to cognitively normal control subjects (\u03bc age = 69.6\u00b1 7.7).\n\ns_09167: All information relating to the survey (including details about the study, what to expect, and confidentiality) was stored in a structured query language (SQL) server database and was made accessible to the BPS:12/17 sample members through web browser interfaces.\n\ns_09217: We obtained estimates of several measures of farm-level impacts associated with commercially available transgenic field crops from a search of the relevant academic journals, Internet searches, and inquiries of researchers who work in this area.\n\ns_09267: Based on these plots, the relationship between age and total daily activity counts was explored for: (i) linearity (Figure 2A) , and (ii) shape (normality) of the distribution ( Figure 2B ).\n\ns_09317: The sizes of the features may play a role, e.g.\n\ns_09367: 1-3 for AD detection on the standardized ADNI dataset using, from left to right: total GM, temporal GM, and hippocampus normalized volumes estimated by FreeSurfer and MorphoBox, respectively.\n\ns_09417: Therefore, as part of the conditions necessary for mediation, we firstly confirmed the existence of a reciprocal association between the mediator (BMD), the predictor (BMI or body weight or body height) and the outcome (severity of AC) by estimating Spearman's correlation coefficients between these variables.\n\ns_09467: The sequencing produced approximately 4.9 M paired reads (150 bp x2), of which 95.2% of the reads were mapped to the reference genome.\n\ns_09517: Virus has been reported to be detectable up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel [29] .\n\ns_09567: We used the L 0 estimator as it is the most robust estimator in the case of problematic distributions described above (S. Duval, personal communication, November 19, 2003) .\n\ns_09617: A large empirical literature has investigated the relationship between time spent on homework and children's cognitive and non-cognitive development; see Cooper, Robinson, and Patall (2006) for a review.\n\ns_09667: To prevent an arbitrary scaling of sparse codes, the columns d j are constrained by\nThus, the problem of dictionary learning can be rewritten as a matrix factorization problem as follows:\nwhere || \u00b7 || 2 F is the Frobenius norm.\n\ns_09717: In our analysis, we took into account students' backgrounds and natural propensities.\n\ns_09767: In this study, we achieved an 86% accuracy to predict AD from MCI, which is a better result than others reported in the literature.\n\ns_09817: The following classification was used to represent their responses.\n\ns_09867: From the cross-validation performance, we see that the Disease-Atlas consistently outperforms both the standard neural network and traditional benchmarks for survival analysis particularly on shortterm horizons -improving the LSTM by 10% and JM by 7% on average across all time steps.\n\ns_09917: One suggestive piece of evidence from the survey itself is that 73 percent of Indians responding to the question \"Which factors would figure most importantly in your decision to start a business in your country of birth?\"\n\ns_09967: As indicated in Tables 5 and 6 there are the findings pertaining to the highest paid teachers and principals in the State of Illinois.\n\ns_00019: The validated, aggregated, and curated data allow researchers to explore hypotheses that would not be possible to formulate using data from a single laboratory.\n\ns_00069: Finally, to address the second research question, we took the aggregated data set and split it into four subsamples based on the four race/ethnicity demographic groupings.\n\ns_00119: Involvement with the child was represented by a scale averaging 12 items asking how frequently fathers engage in activities with the child, such as eating meals, playing games, and brushing teeth (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .87).\n\ns_00169: We used a modified version of the U-Net-like [30] architecture proposed in the original Voxel-Morph paper [7] , which is publicly available online.\n\ns_00219: However, we consider that the present work eloquently shows that a global analysis of mortality is not sufficient to apprehend the specific effect of the pandemic in each country, even in cases where one can assume that they are comparable.\n\ns_00266: To increase the robustness and specificity, as well as the ability to precisely categorize cognitive function in low-risk groups, future studies should also employ more comprehensive neuropsychological assessments [50] than the present study.\n\ns_00316: Other than BLSA, also the RBS and the Troms\u00f8 Study are very old, being started in the 70s (Table 2) ."
