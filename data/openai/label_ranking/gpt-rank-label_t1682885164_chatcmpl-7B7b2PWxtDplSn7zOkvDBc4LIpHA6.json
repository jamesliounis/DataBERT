The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01326: Third, we analyzed the full-text version of all remaining studies and excluded those that did not satisfy selection criteria.\n\ns_01376: In this context, overfit models might give very high accuracies on the training data but will not generalize to new data.\n\ns_01426: The patterns and causes of interannual variability of JES SST have been investigated using the CEOF analysis of the newly-reconstructed SST dataset (1985~2002) from the NOAA/AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder best SST data by iterative EOF analysis.\n\ns_01476: At NSF and NIH, women who applied in 2001 were less likely to apply again.\n\ns_01526: Th ey diff er among the states (Table 2) .\n\ns_01576: Before applying the model to evaluate coastal/estuarine design plans, model validation has been done by simulating hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes over a series of historical typhoon events happened in between 2004 and 2006.\n\ns_01626: Thirdly, the number of sequences sampled represented a tiny fraction of the documented number of imported cases into Colombia; the sample was selected to be a country-wide representative given limited resources for genome sequencing and consequently, the introduced viral diversity may also have been underestimated.\n\ns_01676: Improved accuracy and sensitivity will reduce the numbers of patients required to detect a given treatment effect in a trial, and ultimately, will allow reliable characterization of individual patients for personalized treatment.\n\ns_01726: 33, [45] [46] [47] Given the rare nature of the tumor, limited sample size means that significant results are likely to be even more pronounced.\n\ns_01776: In this paper, we propose a homogeneous model to account for observations across all the missing patterns.\n\ns_01826: Coupled with the recent findings by Dinwiddie and colleagues [33] , we suggested that more efforts should be made to further understand whether the segregation between whites and non-black minorities can benefit population health.\n\ns_01876: characteristics of students in the other data set.\n\ns_01926: Sample receipt and testing are tracked using the workflow module of a custom-designed Progeny Laboratory Information Management System relational database (version 8.2.06; Progeny Software, LLC, South Bend, IN).\n\ns_01976: (3) The sample distributions of key sociodemographic variables were examined in comparison to recent UK population distributions (gleaned from census data) by UK nation of residence; these were age, gender, ethnicity, economic activity, and household composition.\n\ns_02026: A multiple regression was carried out on the total number of points from student's best eight examination scores at the end of KS4 with KS2 mathematics and English and playing an instrument or not as predictors.\n\ns_02076: 19 Although the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unspecified, great attention is required to monitor pangolin-associated activities in reducing the risk for COVID-19.\n\ns_02126: In the US SEER database 1985-2009, 7871 incident gastric cancer cases were identified among Hispanics (Table 2) .\n\ns_02176: Country wise analysis showed that around 78 percent of the total papers were contributed by ten countries.\n\ns_02259: Details of CSF collection and processing are given elsewhere.\n\ns_02309: Some shortcomings of our study are noted here, but also additional research is outlined that will address these limitations.\n\ns_02359: (23) also used baseline glucose and insulin data in ADNI to compute QUICKI and determine glycemic groups for use in cognitive and imaging analyses.\n\ns_02459: 20,21 This study found that physicians are more likely to be in the high LVC group when they have more attributed Medicare patients.\n\ns_02509: To implement this, we performed sliding window analysis with our CNN across approximately 5000 simulated 29903 bp genomes.\n\ns_02559: The implication is that Internet use is a positive indicator of the demand for visits to private agricultural associations and can be used to predict future demand for services from the associations."
