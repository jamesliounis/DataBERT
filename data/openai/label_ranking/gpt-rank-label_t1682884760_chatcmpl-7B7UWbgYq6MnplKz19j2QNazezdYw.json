The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09975: The results of the research conducted in this study challenges some of the assumptions of the current administration's education reform policies [1, 2] .\n\ns_00027: When the project started in 2007 a great deal of ASD-related data had already been aggregated in privately funded data and biorepositories such as the Autism Genetics Research Exchange (AGRE), the Autism Tissue Program (ATP), the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (Fischbach and Lord 2010) , and the Interactive Autism Network (IAN).\n\ns_00077: Individual parameter estimates were also evaluated by testing whether the individual z-statistics were statistically significant.\n\ns_00127: Future research needs to disentangle selection factors that influence the marital status and socioeconomic context of these children's households from the effects of these factors themselves.\n\ns_00177: The pairwise improvement in accuracy of SparseVM is statistically significant with a p-value of 1.60 \u00d7 10 \u221214 using a paired t-test.\n\ns_00227: In the epidemiological analysis of COVID-19, the case fatality ratio (CFR) was a standard measure of the intensity of the pandemic.\n\ns_00274: In conclusion, the present study found that executive or amnestic deficits in either their pure form or in combination occur frequently in a relatively young clinical population (mean age: 63 years) referred for cognitive complaints.\n\ns_00324: 18 Data on the relationship between T and the cardiovascular (CV) system are available from the BLSA, 113 the MrOS, 114 the Troms\u00f8, 110, 111, 112 and the RBS, 115 showing that hypertension is associated to low serum T ( Table 3) .\n\ns_00374: \u2022 December 2013 23 (6) were calculated by multiplying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application rates on a variety of crops in greenhouse, container and field operations (Majsztrik, 2011) by the estimated runoff rate for each operation type based on the output of models developed by Majsztrik (2011) .\n\ns_00424: PVC emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences.\n\ns_00474: Table 6 presents item parameter estimates for slipping, guessing and the discrimination index for both countries.\n\ns_00524: The study was restricted to the four states because of available and consistent land cover and downscaled climate data.\n\ns_00574: \u2022 In parallel, support expansion of the BRAIN Initiative to provide tools and to produce and study both in vitro (cellular, organoid, and explant) models and in vivo models of brain disorders on the basis of insights coming from genetics.\n\ns_00624: On March 17th, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine provided early key recommendations, updated and affirmed on March 30th, including suspending initiation of new treatment cycles aimed at achieving pregnancy.\n\ns_00666: DT Eye is then translated into intensity reduction using the linear relationship found by Schade [2000]: Their analysis suggests that a 2.5 C temperature drop may be sufficient to shut down a cyclone completely, DI is therefore normalized to 2.5 C. Figure 11 shows DT Eye as a function of WPi for the mean June-November CI in the TC-box for each experiment.\n\ns_00716: To counter this prob- (Lefohn et al., 1987; Bilonick, 1988; Adams et al., lem, two binary variables, Hot and Cool, were 1986; Kopp et al., 1984) .\n\ns_00766: Importantly, the original ECLS-K data was collected before or concurrent to the implementation of important provisions of NCLB.\n\ns_00816: However, since the different versions of the ANA were not comparable over the years, the GPLMS research remained inconclusive (Fleisch & Sch\u00f6er, 2014) .\n\ns_00866: Landscapes with moderate coverage (less than [<] 50 percent) of cropland and hayland are used for nesting and foraging (Blair, 1978; Wakeley, 1978; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Konrad and Gilmer, 1986; Schmutz, 1989 Schmutz, , 1991a Bechard and others, 1990; Faanes and Lingle, 1995; Leary and others, 1998) , although near the edges of the breeding range, the species occupies nesting territories that are predominantly cropland (De Smet and Conrad, 1991) .\n\ns_00916: These plots indicated that AD patients and NC elderly could be roughly separated based on their hippocampus volumes.\n\ns_00966: The wind data have a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and height are provided daily.\n\ns_01016: At the Space Launcher System Analysis (SART) department of DLR, an engineering tool for the simulation of propellant management systems is under development.\n\ns_01066: Hopkins and Morehart (2004) compared the cumulative distributions of income and wealth for farm and nonfarm households.\n\ns_01116: These assessments tapped into children's classification, comparison, and shape recognition skills and were combined by the FACES 2009 data collection team.\n\ns_01166: 10 a Pre-Rita SSHA map showing the presence of pre-existing warm ocean eddies (characterized by ?SSHA of *10-40 cm) along Rita's track."
