The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00317: At present, the gold standard LC-MS/MS is being used in all studies, while at the beginning of the studies sex steroids were measured by IAs.\n\ns_00367: Since environmental benefits realized from WSIN technologies will depend critically on adoption rates, this project has sought to develop intuitive and user-friendly WSIN that meets the needs of a large majority of potential end users (Kohanbash and Kantor, 2012; Kohanbash et al., 2013) .\n\ns_00417: The MCSUVR change from baseline to follow-up had the smallest p values with (p = 0.0000075) and without (p = 0.000017) PVC when core white matter was used as the reference.\n\ns_00467: Since the first administration of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 1995, the comparison of the relative performances of participating countries has become very helpful for finding out country-level success relative to other countries.\n\ns_00517: Model evaluation showing species prevalence (proportion of data points with species present) for each dataset, and predictive accuracy using the classification matrix and area under the curve (AUC) values.\n\ns_00567: \u2022 Support advances in human experimental biology (for example, using new physiologic and imaging technologies derived from the BRAIN Initiative) to investigate candidate biomarkers coming from genetic analyses and, when possible, disease pathogenesis.\n\ns_00617: A relative expression value of low, medium, and high expression was established.\n\ns_00659: Annual mean changes of relevant parameters and their standard deviations are given in Table 1.\n\ns_00709: The coefficient for Those reported in NCLAN studies which are based Plant was negative and highly significant in the i sTTI corn regression, suggesting a penalty for late plan on 7-hr daily mean exposure measures (Heck, ing.\n\ns_00759: We begin by framing the paper in the context of developmental theory and ecological systems theory and reviewing the extant literature on early science achievement.\n\ns_00809: This research found that in the long term, those schools whose leaders had participated in the programme achieved higher learner test scores than schools whose leaders had not been a part of the programme (Page, 2010 ).\n\ns_00859: Hawks may nest on anthropogenic structures, such as artificial nest platforms and electrical transmission towers (Coates and others, 2014) .\n\ns_00909: It is expected to obtain improved classification performance to extract informative features from the whole brain MRI data.\n\ns_00959: We define the average composite evolution of the area averaged observable at a time lag \u03c4 from the intense wind day as\nwhere the subscript w, s refers to the winter or summer occurrence of the event considered.\n\ns_01009: The propellant system specific input consists of for example wall thickness, materials, propellant mass, initial propellant temperature and tank geometry.\n\ns_01059: The comparisons between farm and nonfarm households are conducted for all households and then by household type and age group.\n\ns_01109: All models also included longitudinal weights to address cross-wave attrition and ensure that the data were nationally representative.\n\ns_01159: The inclusion of this parameter in the fifth generation National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5; Ali et al.\n\ns_01209: The rates of decline on the ADASCog also showed significant differences overall (P , .001), although the slope change from one group to the next higher group was small relative to the differences in baseline scores (Fig.\n\ns_01259: Lessons from the OECD PIAAC Survey of Adult Skills could also be referenced in drafting the approach of aligning the computer-based assessment with a paper based approach (OECD, 2016b) (see Figure 2) .\n\ns_01309: Ten studies relied on different statistical methods, most frequently latent class analysis, to identify subtypes based on observed data.\n\ns_01359: To date, most predictive algorithms in psychosis have used data from a single modality, such as MRI data 44, 75 or clinical data.\n\ns_01409: This correlation distribution might suggest that warm SAT over the Bering Sea and/or the subtropical to tropical central Pacific is accompanied by a cold anomaly of the first mode SSTA.\n\ns_01459: Women accounted for 21-28 percent of applicants to NSF, NIH, and USDA in recent years and for 25 percent of the survey subsamples of university and medical school researchers we analyzed.\n\ns_01509: A similar experiment using the original GOSSYM was conducted in this study to simulate cotton yield distributions across the entire U.S. Cotton Belt during 1979 to 2005 under more realistic conditions that include observed CO 2 concentrations and climate variations, fertilizer application rates, and irrigation area percentages (all distributed on the CWRF 30-km grid), as well as state-specifi c planting and harvest dates."
