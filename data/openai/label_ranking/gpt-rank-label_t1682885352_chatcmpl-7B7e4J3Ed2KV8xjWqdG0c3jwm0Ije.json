The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07813: For this reason the isolation and careful study of influential observations is an important task in applied modeling.\n\ns_07863: The preparation of project-specific standard documentation for the procurement of goods, works and consulting services has been completed.\n\ns_07913: This suggests that an optimal debt policy may exist although differing in the pre-and post-holiday periods.\n\ns_07963: At the time of this study people living in these apartments were waiting for the completion of the New Onitsha Water Scheme and often for the extension of the distribution network to their neighborhood.\n\ns_08013: It closes with a discussion of areas requiring attention going forward.\n\ns_08063: 21 The model used here follows Rasmus Heltberg's analysis in Fuel Switching: Evidence from Eight Developing Countries.\n\ns_08113: [ ] [ ] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 s t r v g v dv t e s cs is d s bt \u03c4 \u221e \u2212 \u2212 \u222b \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2265 \u222b (3a)\n\ns_08163: Mohan, Rakesh (1985) , \"Urbanization in India's future,\" Population and Development Review, vol.\n\ns_08213: They find that, overall, college is about 5 percentage points less valuable without the direct subsidy.\n\ns_08290: \u2022 Record History: The dates of survey administration.\n\ns_08340: The dataset was sent via email to the research assistant who checked that the coding was accurate.\n\ns_08390: There is large deviation from the expected distribution of association test statistics compared to observed values, with association signals observed far below the level of genome-wide significance (figure 1).\n\ns_08440: Then, we perform a feature extraction step using the voxel intensities and the probability matrix, obtaining a feature space representation for each problem.\n\ns_08490: These therapeutic advances, coupled with advances in early detection of ADrelated pathology in nondemented individuals, suggest that concerted translational research efforts focusing on prevention or early intervention could dramatically reduce the incidence and prevalence of AD.\n\ns_08540: We also shortly highlight the differences existing between the WIC 2015 dataset and the earlier version published in Lutz et al.\n\ns_08590: Elastic net logistic regression uses the standard logistic regression model for the dependence of Y on X:\nHowever, in order to produce sparse classification weight vectors, it estimates \u03b2 by the maximizer of the penalized logistic regression log likelihood function in which is the elastic net penalty.\n\ns_08640: 12,23 Since buprenorphine's approval, its availability from an increasing number of waivered physicians and substance abuse treatment facilities 21,[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] has raised the number of individuals receiving buprenorphine 19,[33][34][35][36][37][38] and often for the longer durations associated with improved outcomes.\n\ns_08690: The population estimates are obtained through the use of IRTs plausible value methodology.\n\ns_08740: Fitzpatrick 38 provides metrics he used to assess the skill of water quality models, including the standard RMSE and standard error, the less useful relative error and relative absolute error (which the authors note are unreliable for small values of the observed quantity), and correlation coefficient, and semi-quantitative metrics, such as PCF used byStumpf et al.\n\ns_08790: Compared with respondents who were married/living together, those who were divorced/separated or widowed were less likely to have participated in health research (OR = 0.59; CI = 0.38-0.93; and OR = 0.55; CI = 0.34-0.90, respectively).\n\ns_08840: For each experiment, the final model was the one that obtained the highest validation balanced accuracy during training.\n\ns_08890: Similarly, only a small minority asserted that race and religion influenced one's chances of getting ahead-in part, perhaps, because young people themselves are more accepting of racial and ethnic diversity, and they assume that society as a whole has a similarly tolerant attitude (Janmaat and Keating, 2017) .\n\ns_08940: First, recall our context of testing mechanisms by producing theories containing mechanisms which match the data.\n\ns_08990: The novel aspect of this work is the combination of an in-depth investigation of the breakup process, previously limited to studies of one season, with an investigation of the predictability of breakup, which is limited to long-term studies.\n\ns_09040: Walk Scores are widely used in research across disciplines and have been shown to produce valid measures of walkability in the United States and other countries [53] [54] [55] [56] ."
