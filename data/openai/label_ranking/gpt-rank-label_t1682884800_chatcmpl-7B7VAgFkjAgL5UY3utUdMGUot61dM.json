The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09926: The data on emigration stocks and flows are notoriously poor.\n\ns_09976: Turning around the lowest-achieving schools (40 points)\nThis paper provides a study of the correlations of rewards, at least, salaries and student performance, i.e., standardized test results.\n\ns_00028: The ATP has federated many of these data sources with NDAR, providing access to a variety of data sets including MRIs of the donor brain tissue.\n\ns_00078: Thus, we disaggregated the data and tested model 5 using each of the six data sets.\n\ns_00128: Coley and Chase-Lansdale (1998) noted the importance of conducting further research on the relationship between father-child bonds and child outcomes.\n\ns_00178: The algorithm used to register images in the population study reported on in [31] used flow fields generated by ANTs, a method that we show is much slower and less accurate than ours.\n\ns_00228: Simultaneously, the gradient in the partial death rate reverses after standardization: Colombia presents the highest standardized partial death rate (SPDR), both for males and females.\n\ns_00275: Conversion of T scores was based on these normative data.\n\ns_00325: 73 A strength of this project is the use of LC-MS/MS for steroid assays, which represents currently the \"gold standard\" (Table 2) .\n\ns_00375: Future work will focus on estimating WSIN-based N and P reductions in field operations nationwide.\n\ns_00425: And it appears that the inter-individual variability was larger when cerebellar cortex was used as reference than when white matter were used as reference.\n\ns_00475: In the DINA model, these two item parameters are defined as follows: , After defining slipping and guessing parameters, the probability of the correct response of a respondent in latent class c for item i can be computed as below:\nAccording to Equation 4, respondents need to master all attributes measured by an item in order to answer this item correctly.\n\ns_00525: We obtained species occurrence (presence/absence) data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) [13] for waterbirds species with a prevalence of $ 0.05.\n\ns_00575: To address those, it is essential that newly developed technologies be applied to further understanding of human brain structure and function in health and disease.\n\ns_00625: As fertility care recommences, the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on implantation and early pregnancy is increasingly relevant.\n\ns_00667: [2009] on the other hand report a slight warming (10.1 C) of the Bay of Bengal associated with freshwater discharge, and Park et al.\n\ns_00717: (1984) report yield increases of the eastern U.S.. Ozone pollution was found to 1.0 percent for corn and 6.0 percent for soybeans reduce yields for both crops.\n\ns_00767: The descriptive table provides initial evidence for disparities in science achievement across groups.\n\ns_00817: Various challenges arising from the systemic context of the school district were highlighted in the findings.\n\ns_00867: In western North Dakota, density of nesting pairs and fledging success did not differ between areas of high intensity oil and gas extraction (for example, 1,273 new wells over a 3-year period) compared to low-intensity areas (for example, 18 new wells) (Wiggins and others, 2017) .\n\ns_00917: The best performance was obtained by the Deep Ordinal Ranking model, and the adjusted accuracy was 0.465.\n\ns_00967: The first recovery period lasts for about 60 days, at the end of which the system has not yet properly reached a state that is zero compatibly with the error bars.\n\ns_01017: The dynamics of sloshing and its mechanical loads are well understood and analytical relations exist.\n\ns_01067: Specific objectives include: 1) to compare income and wealth of farm and nonfarm households using Tukey-Kramer mean comparisons tests, 2) to compare households based on their involvement in business activities for nonfarm households and on their diverse typology for farm households, 3) to examine the equality of the income and wealth distributions among different types of households using Gini coefficients, and 4) to examine the life-cycle differences in income and wealth of these households.\n\ns_01117: Likewise, prior research has shown that young children's academic skills are affected more by early care and education programs than their social behaviors (Forry, Davis, & Welti, 2013; Puma et al., 2010; Winsler et al., 2008) ."
