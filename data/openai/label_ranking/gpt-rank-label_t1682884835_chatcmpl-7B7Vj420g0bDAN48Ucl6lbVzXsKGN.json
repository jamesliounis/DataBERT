The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08677: In 1999, TIMSS (also known as TIMSS-Repeat or TIMSS-R) re-assessed grade eight students' achievement in both mathematics and science in order to measure trends in student achievement since 1995.\n\ns_08727: 24 However, following Williams et al 40 it was decided to limit use of metrics to those statistics which could be easily explained to the marine navigation user community (primarily commercial pilots and ship drivers, commercial and recreational fishers, and recreational boaters) and did not require a mathematical background to interpret.\n\ns_08777: Multivariable regression models were fitted to confirm associations between the predictors (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics, rurality/urbanity, access to care, perceived general health, general health status, and chronic conditions) and the three outcomes of interest.\n\ns_08827: The higher intra-subject similarity compared to the inter-subject similarity ensures that the visualization metric is robust as the same pattern is generated for different sessions of the same subject.\n\ns_08877: These case studies, along with contextual information about their young lives help us to shed light on the ways in which young people talk about their future and make sense of the often-contradictory experiences of their lives.\n\ns_08927: where most of the probability density is).\n\ns_08977: Data from Barrow indicate that thermal breakup occurred once a threshold in the cumulative irradiance recorded at the ARM site had been passed (700 MJ/m 2 , starting integration at 5 June; cf.\n\ns_09027: Future research should examine these social environmental factors and their associations with open campus policies in states with more heterogeneous racial demographics to see how they fare compared with other environmental factors.\n\ns_09077: Figure 13 presents the combined comparison results on track errors and standard deviations of the four TC forecasts between CRTL2 and CRTL2 + ATMS.\n\ns_09127: We quantify the structural variability of the individual by registering the atlas to each image via estimating geodesic diffeomorphic transformations.\n\ns_09177: After the conclusion of data collection, BPS staff imputed missing data for selected variables included in the restricted-use research file and in the public-use data available through the NCES online application PowerStats.\n\ns_09227: Pray, Ma, Huang, and Qiao (2001) considered the impact of Bt cotton in China.\n\ns_09277: In [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] , the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey used accelerometers to measure activity in persons over the age of 6, including 1,260 individuals aged 60 and older (6) and found that older adults spent only 6-10 min/d in activities of moderate or greater intensity with the rest of the time spent in either a sedentary state or low-intensity activity (6) .\n\ns_09327: [1, 5] In this paper we introduce the possibility of measuring correlations of deformation between different brain structures through the introduction of a number of \"correlation parameters\".\n\ns_09377: Also, following Cuingnet et al.\n\ns_09427: Remarkably, in our study, as in others 25, 30 , former and current smoking was an independent predictor of the severity of AC, but no significant interaction was found between smoking and BMI or body weight, and the prevalence of smokers was comparable in normal weight, overweight and obese study participants (43%, 49% and 40%, respectively).\n\ns_09477: We determined that the titer of the passage 2 virus was 2.8x10 4 FFU/ml, while the titers of the passage 3 and passage 4 viruses were 4.3x10 5 FFU/ml and 4.9x10 6 FFU/ml, respectively (Fig 2) .\n\ns_09527: The role of these therapeutic drugs shown in Table 4 .\n\ns_09577: We also attempted to extract information about ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status (SES) to see whether the studies were comparable on these statistics across the life course.\n\ns_09627: The ATUS collects a 24-hour retrospective time diary from one individual over age 15 per household from a subset of the Current Population Survey (CPS) sampling frame and links each diary to demographic, employment, education, and income data from the CPS for all members of the diary respondent's household.\n\ns_09677: In our experimental results (Table 2), we can observe that the proposed method always achieved the best results in all six different classification tasks.\n\ns_09727: Suppose that for the second pair, we have high mathematics achievers whose test scores were one standard deviation above average.\n\ns_09777: Also, the number of cases in this study appeared not much for a current AI learning, and it is still not enough to generalize our experimental results.\n\ns_09827: A review of the literature showed a wide range of studies related to problem-solving skills and strategies for mathematics pre-and in-service teachers involving specific mathematical content or topics.\n\ns_09877: We adopt a deep learning approach to address these limitations, enhancing existing methods with the flexibility and scalability of deep neural networks while retaining the benefits of joint modeling."
