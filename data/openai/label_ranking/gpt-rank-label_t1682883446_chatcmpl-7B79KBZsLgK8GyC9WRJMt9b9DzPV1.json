The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04728: Results for time allocation in generation III are reported in table 2 with panels A and B referring to individuals in the 6 to 14 and 15 to 18 age groups, 9 and results from base and augmented specification in columns 1, 3, 5 and 7 and 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively.\n\ns_04778: In this section we present the simulation results using the calibrated and estimated parameters from both data sets.\n\ns_04828: The GFS database has the largest degree of coverage in comparison to similar data sets such as EUROSTAT or the Asian Development Bank that tend to be region specific.\n\ns_04878: This is referred to as economies of agglomeration, and the literature is generally supportive of this (e.g., Procher, 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Mare and Graham, 2013) .\n\ns_04928: Nevertheless they compare well with other studies estimates, notably with data on public expenditure on infrastructure from the 1980s.\n\ns_04978: The choice of the period of analysis and sample of countries is determined by the availability of data on trade in value added from the OECD-WTO TiVA database used to undertake the main analysis in Section III.\n\ns_05028: The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_05078: In discussing the data, we first describe the surveys used to measure ECD and then how we measure ECD and circumstances.\n\ns_05128: A TFP index for the country is calculated using the data and methodology listed in PWT 8.1 and using the labor share of 0.51 obtained from the GTAP database.\n\ns_05178: Both this paper and Thornton et al.\n\ns_05228: The most recent systematic overviews of these studies have been produced by Bel et al.\n\ns_05278: This paper is organized as follow: Section II introduces the three competing formulas.\n\ns_05328: Our data set contains daily series of EMBI spreads, stock returns, interest rates, and credit ratings.\n\ns_05378: Iteratively, these values are substituted with imputed values drawn from the posterior distribution estimated from the regression for .\n\ns_05428: Section 3 discusses the data sources and the patterns emerging from the data.\n\ns_05478: See the survey byDjankov (2009).\n\ns_05528: The empirical parameters are estimated using several data sets.\n\ns_05578: The dataset contains full name of the treatment plant, daily capacity, actual amount of wastewater treated and city information.\n\ns_05628: Fuente: estimaciones de los autores con datos ENCEL y ENCASEH Figura C2.3.\n\ns_05678: It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world.\n\ns_05728: Results for the 2011-2015 sub-period show some differences with respect to previous findings (Tables 28 and 29) .\n\ns_05778: More work is needed with much larger samples to enable measurement of the heterogeneity of returns to training with willingness-to-pay, following the procedure we have outlined in this paper.\n\ns_05828: N  362  434  406  34  93  min  11  13  14  14  21  p10  22  25  25  23  23  p25  35  31  31  31  26  p50  55  43  44  84  36  p75  87  70  70  125  116  p90  132  100  102  176  152  p95  151  115  113  196  160  p99  210  137  130  297  210  max  306  190  173  297  210 Tables 6 to 8 present summary statistics for CAMS-3 air pollution measures and predictions from the global technologies for the same times and weather conditions.\n\ns_05878: The report by AfDB, OECD, UNDP (2014), looks specifically at the role of GVC participation in the context of a strategy for the industrialization of an economy.\n\ns_05928: See for instanceDevereux et al."
