The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08086: The paper offers an overview of the links between fiscal targets, public investment, and public sector solvency.\n\ns_08136: 1/ From Goldsmith (1985) .\n\ns_08186: The Model To study these questions, the authors develop a model that allows for differences across high school graduates with respect to their initial skill level (that is, their initial \"human\" capital); how efficiently they can further accumulate human capital; how likely they are to complete college; the individual-specific uninsurable earnings risks they face, such as job loss or illness; and their initial wealth.\n\ns_08236: The team that now runs this program offers a view into its inner workings.\n\ns_08263: Current databases are examining trends for students with disabilities before entering, during, and after graduating from college.\n\ns_08313: For economic measures, the research assistant went through the two sources (IGC if the country was coded in their dataset, IMF if the country was not coded in the IGC) and orally listed for each country the economic measures implemented.\n\ns_08363: ADGC was supported by the NIH/NIA grants: U01 AG032984, U24 AG021886, U01 AG016976, and the Alzheimer's Association grant ADGC- 10-196728.\n\ns_08413: In the case of AD vs MCI, the worst results are for w = 3 and \u03d5 = 0.3 and it is approximately 64%, but the best result is obtained using only 50 features and a small window and density in the XMT-DBSCAN algorithm (w = 2 and \u03d5 = 0.3).\n\ns_08463: The main support for the hypothesis has come from a convergence of genetic, cell biological, animal modeling, pathological, and biophysical studies.\n\ns_08513: Similar issues were found in De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech dataset (2012), where there are some problems with the processing and harmonization of the available educational data as basis for filling the data gaps.\n\ns_08563: Further information can be found in [15] and at www.adni-info.org.\n\ns_08613: We sought to translate grams of buprenorphine into the potential number of individuals treated with buprenorphine in a year to provide a greater clinical context for our analysis and findings, as we are aware that because of the tremendous variation in how buprenorphine is used, the calculation would be, at best, a rough guide.\n\ns_08663: The sampling process used in selecting students in TIMSS-2003 was the same as that used in the previous TIMSS studies.\n\ns_08713: These values provide information on the model's behaviour in frequency space and can also illuminate the role of friction and non-linear processes.\n\ns_08763: This will be the first study of its kind to examine factors related to participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate in health research from a large representative sample in a rural and diverse state.\n\ns_08813: Hence we need to check if the visualization method gives coherent results based on the CNN training.\n\ns_08863: In addition to this web survey, in 2013 and 2014, we also conducted 101 in-depth semi-structured interviews in England with young people aged 18-26.\n\ns_08913: Kolmogorov -Smirnov statistic -when using the Kolmogoro -Smirnov it is usually important to apply a Lilliefors type correction (1967), since the parameters are usually estimated from the data.\n\ns_08963: Yet, within the limits discussed above, the consistently acquired set of physical observations can be used as indicator for conditions that are meaningful in a broader context.\n\ns_09013: However, the effects of the walkability (OR = 1.035; 95% CI = 1.017 to 1.054) and the 20-mile food desert (OR = 0.977; 95% CI = 0.957 to 0.998) variables maintain their magnitude and statistical significance with the inclusion of the organizational environment variable in Model 2.\n\ns_09063: It is still the most common method to diagnose TC intensity, with further attempts at intensity analysis heavily borrowing for this work's legacy.\n\ns_09113: edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf function can be measured using functional imaging modalities, such as [\n18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET).\n\ns_09163: This section summarizes the results of the BPS:12/17 pilot-test student survey data collection, including located and interviewed rates, completed surveys by mode of administration, and incentive choice by prior-round response status.\n\ns_09213: 1 Many of these critics cite early USDA estimates of differences in profit, pesticide use, and pesticide cost between transgenic and conventional technologies, from an annual survey known as the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS; USDA Economic Research Service [ERS], 1999).\n\ns_09263: Those who were employed tended to be more active, but the difference was only significant in group 1 (p < .01, Table 3 )."
