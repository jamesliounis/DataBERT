The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04619: 12 In Section 4, we will then compare the multipliers obtained under typical expansions and recessions with those obtained under extreme expansions and recessions (i.e., for the cases in which I(:) = 0 and I(:) = 1, respectively).\n\ns_04669: Specifically, the paper aims to answer a simple question: what are the chances that an Egyptian child will have adequate access to critical basic services regardless of his or her circumstances at birth, such as gender, place of birth, and family background?\n\ns_04719: Given that we are interested in how financial development influences average project size when FDI occurs, the observations for which FDI is positive form an appropriate subsample of the population of interest (Wooldridge, 2010) .\n\ns_04769: In fact, the potentially far-reaching effect of legal provisions regarding divorce (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006) or access to political office (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004) on female empowerment in the long term is well documented in the literature.\n\ns_04819: Unfortunately, the data do not constitute a panel, but when stratified by age of the household head, one is left with a substantial sample.\n\ns_04869: Our analysis exploits the GEM database, which covers 50 developed and developing economies between 2001 and 2009 and which includes all startups, regardless of their legal status.\n\ns_04919: Finally, using the results and transforming the equation, the generalized spatial two-stage least-squared estimator can be obtained.\n\ns_04969: One is to run the regressions on first differences, which Canning shows to be stationary.\n\ns_05019: Consistently with existing firm-level studies, column (4) highlights finally, unit roots in variables are less of an issue.\n\ns_05069: Moreover, in five of the seven countries, the average export intensity of firms increased significantly more among firms that used export promotion services, as indicated by the differences-in-differences t-statistic in the last column.\n\ns_05119: models underlie both these measures and allow for Shapley decompositions of the factors contributing to the inequality measured by the dissimilarity index.\n\ns_05169: Please see appendix A.2 for a brief discussion on factors that are important in driving TFP growth.\n\ns_05219: 17 The results in Table 4 show that the effects of health insurance do not differ by whether the ineligible child has a covered sibling, suggesting that the results are primarily driven by having insured parents.\n\ns_05269: Ostrom (1990) or more recently Pal (2009) ).\n\ns_05319: Step 2 : Compute the share of each state i in the national population of the children of schoolgoing age.\n\ns_05369: Appendix Table 2 shows the scale and type of ratings used by each rating agency.\n\ns_05419: Thus, the retrieved consumption estimate is consistent and -using the evidence from the ex post simulations -highly accurate.\n\ns_05469: Tables 21 and 22 present the OLS and the IV results, respectively.\n\ns_05519: The present research project, however, has proven itself useful in outlining specific legal and regulatory frameworks for the selected citizen-government interactions, which can be used for future reference and the eventual development of more sophisticated research tools.\n\ns_05569: Given that the number of observations is significantly smaller, we estimate more parsimonious specifications by replacing year dummy variables with decade dummy variables.\n\ns_05619: flood fraction 0 to 1.0) for each AOGCM (spatial resolutions: 2.5 min x 2.5 min) (Hu et al., 2015) .\n\ns_05669: 2018), principalmente por la dificultad para contar con un panel longitudinal que incluya indicadores de salud.\n\ns_05719: Such a strategy could be a useful first step in implementing a reasonable budget execution system in countries that do not have one.\n\ns_05769: We combine four sources of data.\n\ns_05819: The second literature this paper contributes to is one on methods to estimate the demand for products or services."
