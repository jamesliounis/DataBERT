The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09264: This methodology is an essential step in assessing and understanding the true amount of activity performed by relatively sedentary sectors of the population and may clarify the level of physical activity needed for preventative purposes in future longitudinal studies involving physical activity, comorbidities, and aging.\n\ns_09314: (This is obtained with the aid of an exhaustive search).\n\ns_09364: (2002 ), Fischl (2012 and the references therein, which segments an incoming scan in a large number of anatomical structures and subsequently computes corresponding volumes.\n\ns_09414: The present study has some limitations.\n\ns_09464: The filtered variants and reference SARS-CoV-2 genome were used to generate the consensus sequence using bcftools v1.9 [27] .\n\ns_09514: Studies have documented levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a, and TNFa were associated with disease severity in COVID-19 [32, 63] .\n\ns_09564: When possible, we tested the likelihood of publication bias by using a trim and fill procedure (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) .\n\ns_09614: 596-604) , which can be directly compared to OLS coefficient estimates, are reported in online appendix table A.4.\n\ns_09664: [6] constructed a classifier at each vertex by using the cortical thickness as a feature vector.\n\ns_09714: Career expectation\nCovariate groups oversampling of some ethnic and minority groups and (ii) the effect of multistage cluster sampling on standard error estimation.\n\ns_09764: As we can see from the Table 3 , ROIs extracted by the region-growing algorithm better reflects the differences compared to the AAL template; compared to traditional PCA, DBN has better feature extraction capability.\n\ns_09814: The study results demonstrated six different strategies based on the difficulty of the problem and, in particular, based on the position of the unknown quantity.\n\ns_09864: landmarking [7] and joint models (JM) fitted with a two-step approximation [8] ).\n\ns_09914: We have organized the rest of the paper around four sections.\n\ns_09964: The key point is that the variable, the number of low-income students, is inversely related and at relative high level of statistical significance.\n\ns_00016: The web site also provides easy data browsing by the investigator who submitted the data or by the paper that was published using the data.\n\ns_00066: For the purposes of this study, we concentrated on a particular subset of the emerging biomedical research workforce: medical school students enrolled in MD/PhD programs (i.e., MD/PhD program enrollees).\n\ns_00116: We used all three of these data sources to construct information about the life situations of children and their biological fathers.\n\ns_00166: Table 1 summarizes the average and median Dice scores for all test subjects on the ventricles, and the average test runtimes of each method.\n\ns_00216: This is mostly due to the lack of a full year of exposure, given that death rates are calculated (or at least they should be) as the quotient of deaths (D) and the mean population (N) in a given year (conventionally expressed in the population at June 30 or July 1).\n\ns_00263: Our findings might have been similar to the findings of Nordlund et al.\n\ns_00313: [130] [131] [132] These data on mood 105 and cognition were also replicated by the RBS study, 133 and the HIMS 134 ; in particular the latter showed an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms in association to low serum total T 135 (Table 3) .\n\ns_00363: These impacts of WSIN use should result in economic returns on investments high enough to expect relatively high adoption rates of this technology (Belayneh et al., 2013; Chappell et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) .\n\ns_00413: [17] , was approximated by combining corpus callosum and the ROI labelled as \"UnsegmentedWhiteMatter\" by FreeSurfer.\n\ns_00463: Although some researchers question the relationship between student-level (or country-level) achievement and comparison studies based on such international large-scale assessments (Holliday & Holliday, 2003; Wang, 2001 ), In order to provide an example to show how diagnostic feedback can be given using real data, this study analyzes TIMSS 2011 data from a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA; Leighton & Gierl, 2007) perspective."
