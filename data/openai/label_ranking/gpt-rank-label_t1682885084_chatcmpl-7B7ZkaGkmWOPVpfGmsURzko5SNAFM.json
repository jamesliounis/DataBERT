The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05007: 5 We estimate the regressions with standard errors clustered across cross-section (White cross-section covariance method).\n\ns_05057: There are a couple of exemptions, such as Bernard and Jensen (2004) and Gorg, Henry and Strobl (2008) , but these studies focused on developed countries (the U.S. and Ireland, respectively).\n\ns_05107: Initially, a sample size of 8,094 households was planned to ensure representativeness across the country in each area of residence (urban, rural) and even at the level of certain regions.\n\ns_05157: Source: World Development Indicators total population in 1980, the working age population share grew by more than 13 percentage points in the last 35 years.\n\ns_05207: We do not believe that this is cause for concern due to the large number of hypotheses tested in this table and because this outcome has a low mean in the sample at baseline (0.028).\n\ns_05257: The data is then usually processed through relatively standardized (and overpriced) software which can be used to simulate any tariff structure.\n\ns_05307: Note that these are point elasticities, evaluated at the mean of federal transfers and enrollment probability for each state, but in the estimation of additional funding, the elasticity is assumed to be constant over the 10% and 20% intervals used as the two scenarios.\n\ns_05357: It also contributes to the literature on contagion and international transmission of shocks by examining the effect of domestic vulnerability, as measured by the ratings of international agencies, on the extent of international spillovers.\n\ns_05407: The first class of techniques simply uses summary statistics like the average to impute missing data.\n\ns_05457: Tables 18 and 19 report the estimation results using the travel time and ad valorem measures, respectively.\n\ns_05507: Data collection was carried out from October 2016 through July 2017.\n\ns_05557: There is a large body of literature showing that, even in developed countries with flexible labor markets, trade and technology shocks have significant impacts on employment levels (see, for instance, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) ).\n\ns_05607: For each particular grid cell, \u210e , we first estimate the change in flood fraction \u2206 between the representative time period (e.g.\n\ns_05657: Y al igual que sucede con el modelo de talla, el coeficiente de persistencia se reduce de 0.34 a 0.29 cuando se incluyen como controles las variables de nivel localidad, lo que sugiere un efecto territorial sobre la movilidad potencial, que se ubica en 71% (cuadro 2, columna1, 3, estimaciones tobit ).\n\ns_05707: Applying these may require a paradigm shift but holds promise of a more effective engagement and achieving expedited results.\n\ns_05757: This result also contrasts with the evidence found for 2005-2010, which was in line with previous findings for developed countries.\n\ns_05807: We first conduct the analysis using the full sample.\n\ns_05857: We summarize the overall implications of our results in Table 5 , which reports pollution predictions across the full range of traffic speeds.\n\ns_05907: It is worth noting that both sets of linkages developed in the 20 years leading up to 2015.\n\ns_05957: However, it has been shown in the growing body of literature that most of the world's trade is invoiced in a vehicle currency, especially the U.S. dollar.\n\ns_06007: This study aims to (1) examine how socioeconomic variables and perception factors affect mobile internet adoption; and (2) compare differences in mobile internet adoption across different countries, regions, and demographic profiles from the demand side.\n\ns_06057: 1 It is also worth noting that the standard deviation of within each sample of countries is relatively low: 7 percent and 9 percent in Latin American and industrial countries, respectively.\n\ns_06107: However, an inherent challenge in the literature on conflict and forced migration is the absence of a complete longitudinal data set for conditions in countries of asylum and origin that can be mapped onto refugee characteristics.\n\ns_06157: We find a correlation coefficient of 0.118 with a P-value 0.476.\n\ns_06207: The responses provided by participants in the phone survey were weighted to match the characteristics of the 2016-18 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in PNG (National Statistical Office of PNG and ICF, 2019)."
