The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06206: The five potential drivers of vaccine hesitancy, which are focused on one by one below, are discussed in the related literature section (Section 2).\n\ns_06256: Table 3 shows the estimated intercept and slope coefficients when considering three such specifications.\n\ns_06306: To estimate the effect of the program on the outcomes of interest, we rely on the randomized design of the program and run a difference-in-differences (DID) model.\n\ns_06356: Table A4 reports the rates of co-residency by country-sample for different ages.\n\ns_06406: Figures 1A (China) , 1B (India), and 1C (Indonesia) present the graphs of the estimated conditional mean and conditional variance functions using the full sample .\n\ns_06456: First, the broader literature on the effects of COVID-19 on households and firms in emerging economies.\n\ns_06506: Value tells how many observations at the given node fall into each category or class, in our case, we have two classes: has worked on a community problem in the past year or not.\n\ns_06556: But part of it reflects the changes implemented by TPOs during this period.\n\ns_06606: These objectives are reconciled by the innovative expedient of implementing two models on a common data base: (i) a disaggregated 72-sector (price sensitive) input-output version that makes simplified assumptions regarding certain economy wide relationships; and (ii) an aggregated 6-sector version that pays careful attention to those relationships and can suggest what corrections ought therefore to be made to the results of the sectorally disaggregated analysis.\n\ns_06656: It is pertinent to ask therefore what lessons can be drawn from their several years of experience with an integrated approach.\n\ns_06706: The sterilization coefficient is a statistically significant -0.37.\n\ns_06756: While this paper focused on the lessons from the scaling up of the microfinance industry, and its impact on the poor, the story would be incomplete without briefly mentioning the future challenges that the industry faces in Bangladesh.\n\ns_06806: Finally, we calculated the average lobbying expenditure over this four year period by 3-digit ISIC industry and by country.\n\ns_06856: 7 See table 1 for highlights of the World Bank's new rural development strategy for Central America.\n\ns_06906: Then Section 3 reviews existing evidence on differential mortality and fertility, and presents some new evidence.\n\ns_06956: Continuing in the same vein, table 6 computes a two-way contingency table, where the columns are teachers who were more or less absent and the rows are students who were more or less absent.\n\ns_07006: A commonly used measure is the household dependency ratio defined as the number of non-working household members over those that are employed or self-employed.\n\ns_07056: Obviously the high employment dependency in these locations which generally were relatively poor areas, increased the political visibility of the petition.\n\ns_07106: Araujo, de Janvry, and Sadoulet (2004) present a munic\u00edpio-level, spatial model of employment growth in Mexico that is the closest precursor of the current paper.\n\ns_07156: The measures of liquidity are constructed using weekly trading data from Datastream.\n\ns_07206: In a simple regression of enrollment on a dummy variable for attrited households, with standard errors corrected for within-sibling correlation, the coefficient is -0.083, with a robust standard error of 0.038.\n\ns_07256: However, our third finding suggests the conventional wisdom may need to be revisited in an important respect as it assumes that multilateral disciplines are applied.\n\ns_07306: (b) R 2 's reported under FE models are R 2 within.\n\ns_07356: Paragraph 12, titled \"Implementation-related issues and concerns.\"\n\ns_07406: Panel: cross section and time series."
