The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09313: Thus considering the percentage of AD and NL in our whole dataset (12 in 31, and 19 in 31), it becomes clear that the optimal result does not occur when all subjects are considered simultaneously, as is shown in Table 1 .\n\ns_09363: Our findings are in line with the observation of Cuingnet et al.\n\ns_09413: Because of the nonlinear trend of BMI and obesity across AC severity groups (Table 1) , a BMI-squared term was entered into Model 1 and a significant nonlinear relationship between BMI and AC severity was observed (p=0.026).\n\ns_09463: The first sequence was generated in March 2020 and deposited in GISAID (EPI_ISL_417413).\n\ns_09513: MSCs are available at multiple sources including blood, bone, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord etc.\n\ns_09563: c Data were unreported means on personality measures from the samples described in the respective studies that we acquired from the authors of the original studies.\n\ns_09613: Therefore, to provide a fuller understanding of the size and nature of gaps in homework time, we augment the ATUS analysis with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which is a nationally representative survey of tenth-grade students in 2002 that was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\ns_09663: Output: The learned dictionary and coefficients D, Z where\nfor i = 1 to n do Calculate the sparse code z i by using several steps of coordinate descent (CD) [11] .\n\ns_09713: This behavior is common in such analyses because variance accounted for by initially entered variables is subsumed by successive variables.\n\ns_09763: (2) Many other modality characteristics in the ADNI data set, such as clinical information, age, education, and CSF parameters, are not used, and it is still necessary to design a multimodal deep learning network to learn potential relationships among features from multiple modalities.\n\ns_09813: This study builds on the theoretical foundations of existing studies to present research focused on problem-solving strategies.\n\ns_09863: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study data is a comprehensive dataset that tracks the progression of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) through 3 main states: normal brain function, mild cognitive impairment and the onset of either the disease or dementia.\n\ns_09913: 27 26 A recent paper that looks at the determinants of US foreign direct investment in Ireland is Gunnigle and McGuire (2001) .\n\ns_09963: Going back to the discussion of the constant term please observe that from model one to model four it decreases in importance as the coefficients and also in statistical significance.\n\ns_00015: A third way to search through the database is to use the Data from Papers tab.\n\ns_00065: The second was data regarding background information on high schools and colleges attended (i.e., wealth and size) by our participants.\n\ns_00115: We used the t-scores, which adjust for children's age at assessment by comparing them with the distribution of scores for others their age, in descriptive analyses.\n\ns_00165: For VM and PBR, we used the optimal parameters given in the original publications, except for the cross correlation neighborhood size.\n\ns_00215: CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a perpetuity.\n\ns_00262: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. eMCI = Dysexecutive MCI; aMCI = amnestic MCI; mMCI = multidomain MCI; n.s.\n\ns_00312: 37, 54, 57 After the above mentioned study, several other studies on large cohort of aging men were prospectively performed.\n\ns_00362: Briefly, the models used average N and P rates applied by greenhouse, container, and field growers in Maryland to derive baseline runoff rates for the scenarios reported here.\n\ns_00412: Analyzed the data: YS TMB CJO JJC KF NJM QW AZS KC EMR CX.\n\ns_00462: Assuming that we have enough model-data fit, we can make several conclusions based on DINA model results.\n\ns_00512: To assess model transferability, we predicted to the drought data subset using species distribution models created with the remaining wetter years [31, 32] ."
