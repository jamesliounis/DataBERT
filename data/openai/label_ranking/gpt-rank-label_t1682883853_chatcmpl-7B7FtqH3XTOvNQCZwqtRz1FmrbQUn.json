The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09607: Analyses of the ATUS time-use data utilize a number of other controls that are commonly used in time-use regressions (e.g., Gershenson, 2013; Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) .\n\ns_09657: We randomly split the data into training and testing sets using a In each set of experiment, we compared cortical thickness on left, right hemisphere and both hemispheres (whole brain), respectively.\n\ns_09707: The sample was further reduced to a final size of 3,359 participants, because 384 participants were missing data in one or more of the variables used in the analysis.\n\ns_09757: We obtain the ROIs with spatial coordinates according to Pearson correlation of the sample series, which can reflect better differences between samples than single voxel or the ROIs obtained based on the Euclidean distance.\n\ns_09807: The research collected was reviewed and presented based on participants in those studies addressing teachers' and students' strategies.\n\ns_09857: Using data from the ADNI, the Disease-Atlas [5] demonstrated performance gains over both simpler neural networks such as LSTMs and traditional methods from biostatistics -demonstrating the advantages of the Disease-Atlas as a method for joint modeling and highlighting its potential as a tool for clinical decision support.\n\ns_09907: ( , 2002 provide evidence that is consistent with an overall positive effect on human capital for a number of countries, though they readily admit their data has many limitations.\n\ns_09957: The source of the data is the Illinois State Board of Education.\n\ns_00009: The data available in NDAR associated with a paper listed in PubMed is made available using their LinkOut feature.\n\ns_00059: These results are summarized in Table 3 .\n\ns_00109: Birth certificate information was used when available, with the following reports filling in any gaps: ECLS-B's constructed paternal age measure, father survey reports, and mother interview reports.\n\ns_00159: Importantly the fields Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.\n\ns_00209: When information about death distributed by age groups is available, both CFR and PCDR could be expressed as the sum of the different death proportions (P) of cases (C) and population (N) respectively by age groups (e), which also could help us calculating rates in a given age group or interval.\n\ns_00256: The cited studies employ different individual measures of executive functions, combine executive and nonexecutive measures, employ different composite measures and different cutoff criteria for impairment and study different age groups, and many include only a small number of participants.\n\ns_00306: Data available on the relationship among aging, hypogonadism, and infectious diseases are scanty.\n\ns_00356: Water use in container and field operations were estimated by adjusting FRIS open field data using proportions derived from Majsztrik (2011), as detailed above.\n\ns_00406: A cross-sectional cohort (CC) was selected from the Washington University in St. Louis (WU) site DIAN cohort, including 69 participants (38 mutation carriers) with valid baseline PiB scans on the same PET scanner.\n\ns_00456: Hence, this CDA-based study examines the following research questions:\n1.\n\ns_00506: The excluded data were used to validate the models created with these data: the ''main test set''.\n\ns_00556: Examples include the sharing of data (in conjunction with appropriate ways of protecting the privacy of individuals), the sharing of methods and key reagents by scientists, increased incentives for scientific rigor (as opposed to premature publication), and decreased barriers to partnerships between academic and industrial researchers that address the issue of conflicts of interest.\n\ns_00606: The authors assessed endometrial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by measuring endometrial ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B and L, FURIN, MX1, and BSG gene expression.\n\ns_00648: [2012a], comparing TC intensification in color-affected and clear regions, could prove to be useful in the future.\n\ns_00698: weighting technique provides a statistic that capData on precipitation and temperature were ob-tures important components of ozone exposure that tained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric affect plant development, including peaks, chronic Administration (NOAA) and published in Teigen exposures, and duration, better than an average or and Singer (1992).\n\ns_00748: Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for our full analytic sample as well as broken out by student race/ethnicity and gender.\n\ns_00798: An investigation by Louis et al."
