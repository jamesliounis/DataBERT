The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08547: For the Barro and Lee (2013) (2007) is not one to one comparable to the post-secondary education category in the WIC 2015 dataset which includes the ISCED 4 category (post-secondary non-tertiary) which was under secondary in the previous dataset.\n\ns_08597: Multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), studied independently or coupled with other biomarker data (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuropsychological assessments), have been shown to be sensitive to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, thought to be the prodromal stage of AD).\n\ns_08647: I n the United States, opioid use disorders are a significant public health problem, estimated to affect more than 2 million individuals.\n\ns_08697: The cognitive dimension describes the many kinds of behaviour expected of students as they engage with the content in school mathematics and science.\n\ns_08747: For generic purposes, all time series (observations, tidal predictions, and model output) required by the skill assessment programs are processed and reformatted into the same ASCII format.\n\ns_08797: With respect to opportunity to participate in health research, we found that respondents aged 25-34 and 35-44 were less likely to have had an opportunity relative to respondents aged 65 years or older (OR = 0.18; CI = 0.08-0.50; and OR = 0.46; CI = 0.23-0.95, respectively).\n\ns_08847: This problem might be resolved by using more samples and with a better initialization, given for example by an autoencoder pretraining.\n\ns_08897: Yet while Silva's participants continued to have faith in their intergenerational social mobility and the American Dream, Putnam's (2016) most recent work provides evidence of its inexorable end due to growing income inequality and the related rise in the opportunity gap between the rich and the poor.\n\ns_08947: 1990 , Boucot 1996 , Brett et al.\n\ns_08997: In keeping with common practice we express MDD in\u00b0C days (i.e., 8.64 \u00c2 10 4 Ks) [Petrich and Eicken, 2010].\n\ns_09047: However, these are associations, and there is a need to evaluate the impact of open campus policies on students' lunch time food purchasing, dietary, and physical activity behaviors across rural and urban settings with varying levels of walkability and access to healthy and affordable food.\n\ns_09097: The widely used analysis method for satellite remote sensing of TC is called the Dvorak technique [22] .\n\ns_09147: Since the anatomical shape and metabolic activity are two separate measures obtained from independent imaging modalities, we combine the two spaces to form a product space that defines the combined space of imaging modalities, M such that:\nThe factor, \u03b7 is interpretable as a relative weight when both the modalaties are normalized to have unit variance.\n\ns_09197: Due to the expense of sending all cases to NSC, statisticians used information from BPS:04/06 to identify institutional strata that had high falsepositive rates in this previous BPS cohort.\n\ns_09247: Although definitive conclusions will require more research, the widespread adoption of this technology clearly indicates that the production costs are sufficiently lower to make RR soybeans profitable for the vast majority of growing conditions and farm types throughout the US.\n\ns_09297: Model 2 expands upon model 1 by adding sex and body mass index to the model.\n\ns_09347: The combination of the input features for which the SVM method attains its highest accuracy is given by: Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and Hippocampus and Ventricle Region size.\n\ns_09397: In this work, we used FreeSurfer version 5.1.0 and were mainly interested in temporal GM, total GM, hippocampus and ventricular volumes output by FreeSurfer as potential imaging biomarkers of ADrelated brain atrophy.\n\ns_09447: From the original cohort of 711 individuals who met these criteria, 23 subjects were excluded because of missing covariates and 1 subject because of the presence of aortic and iliac intraluminal prostheses, leaving a final sample of 687 individuals, 351 women (mean age 66\u00b112 years, range 31-95) and 336 men (mean age 68\u00b113 years, range 28-94).\n\ns_09497: The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\ns_09547: Lung tissue has high renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity which is chief site of Ang II synthesis.\n\ns_09597: We proceeded as follows to create data sets with independent effect sizes for each of the trait categories.\n\ns_09647: Accordingly, we augment the ATUS analyses with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which contains the high school transcripts of tenth graders in 2002 as well as students' performance on standardized math and reading tests.\n\ns_09697: Based on the cortical thickness features computed by FreeSurfer, this paper proposes a novel machine learning framework for the diagnosis of different stages of AD.\n\ns_09747: This is an attractive but expensive approach."
