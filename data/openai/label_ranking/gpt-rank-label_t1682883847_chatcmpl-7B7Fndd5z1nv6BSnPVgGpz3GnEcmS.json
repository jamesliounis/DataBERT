The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08357: The AD GPS was generated in the target population based cohort using summary data from the AD GWAS meta analysis from the IGAP discovery sample consisting of 17,008\nAlzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls [26] .\n\ns_08407: In our methodology, the local density is computed as\nwhere \u2299 is the element-wise product of two equally sized data cubes, K w is a cubic Gaussian kernel with standard deviation equal to ws/(4 2 log(2)), I w v i jk is the sub-window from the intensity image, and a k is the number of non-zero values in K w .\n\ns_08457: In any case, the knowledge-based, regulatory, and legal issues involved in using both validated and novel surrogate biomarkers for AD trials are substantial and require detailed consideration (Katz, 2004) .\n\ns_08507: The paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_08557: Although recent studies reported promising prediction rates by integrating these multi-modal data [7, 10, 16] , few were focused on identifying a small set of disease relevant biomarkers [13] to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying mechanisms associated with complex disorders.\n\ns_08607: We estimated weighted least squares with state-level population weights to account for possible differences in the variance of the error terms (heteroskedasticity) across states that might be caused by state-level population size.\n\ns_08657: To obtain information on the context within which science and mathematics learning takes place, TIMSS-2003(like TIMSS 1995and 1999) developed a contextual framework to obtain information from curriculum specialists such as personnel from the Ministries of education of participating countries, students in participating schools, their science and mathematics teachers and their head teachers.\n\ns_08707: These data are processed and analysed using several techniques which include tidal prediction, harmonic analysis, gap filling and interval conversion, Fourier filtering, and other methods.\n\ns_08757: [6][7][8] Furthermore, prior research suggests that participation in health research is disproportionate across races and ethnicities.\n\ns_08807: In the longitudinal analysis, all the sessions of one subject were compared by pairs and the mean value of these comparisons gave the intra-subject similarity for this subject.\n\ns_08857: Combined, then, these empirical studies highlight the need to look at variation within and between countries, and to explore the individualization thesis with caution and through a highly contextualized lens.\n\ns_08907: This includes some of the most famous of all macroecological patterns: the power-law (S=cA z ) species area relationship (SPAR), the hollow curve distribution of species abundances (SAD), and the skewed-lognormal distribution of body size (BSD) .\n\ns_08957: Recent work by Mahoney et al.\n\ns_09007: Table 3 summarizes the results from our logistic regression analyses.\n\ns_09057: Some efforts focused on cataloging TCs through an extended climatology of microwave imagers.\n\ns_09107: Table 1 reports the details about the subject demographics, diagnosis, apoe carrier status and future conversion status.\n\ns_09157: For a complete list of data elements, see appendix D. For the complete BPS:12/17 student interview, see appendix E. Enrollment items included questions to determine study eligibility for sample members who were nonrespondents in both NPSAS:12 and BPS:12/14 (double nonrespondents).\n\ns_09207: 2 The purpose of this study is to collect and characterize the farm-level economic evidence for field crops available in the public domain, organize it, and determine if any general implications can be drawn from it.\n\ns_09257: To provide contextual validity to these measures, we tested the hypothesis that common age-related comorbidities and employment status may alter these metrics.\n\ns_09307: From the result, which is shown in Table 3 , we can see that it has a high accuracy (90.32% for all sets), while the optimal AD and NL accuracy rate can be achieved at the same time for the original feature data and the Scaled feature data, as shown in Table 3 .\n\ns_09357: We used the screening scans from the 1.5 T dataset (818 image sets corresponding to distinct subjects: 229 controls, 401 MCI, 188 AD) and the baseline scans from the 3 T dataset (151 image sets corresponding to distinct subjects: 47 healthy, 71 MCI, 33 AD).\n\ns_09407: Thus, our data provide a potential link between the so-called \"calcification paradox\" and \"obesity paradox\" 1, 49 .\n\ns_09457: Our data are in agreement with that of Harcourt et.al., in which SARS-CoV-2 replicated rapidly in Vero cells after an initial eclipse phase and increased gradually, peaking at 48 h post-infection [42] .\n\ns_09507: In our previous papers, we have shown that various polymorphic variants of vitamin D receptor gene modulate the metabolism of blood lead levels along with circulatory levels of vitamin D [117, 118] .\n\ns_09557: Finally, we further organized the data around the sex of the sample studied, aggregating data within the categories of male, female, and data from combined samples."
