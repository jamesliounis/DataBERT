The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07841: These studies would provide the basis for future Bank assistance in the sector.\n\ns_07891: Section IV presents some effective tax comparisons for the countries surveyed in Section II.\n\ns_07941: Rather the choice is between information which can be obtained from the kind of surveys carried out in this study (or information which can be obteined from other kinds of fast, relatively inexpensive studies).\n\ns_07991: However, the real challenge has been its execution in view of the ambitious timetable set for the process, CBR's limited capabilities, the information problems faced, and above all, by the limited support offered to the CBR for a strict implementation of the strategy.\n\ns_08041: with the Ministry of Economy and EPCG (February 2006).\n\ns_08091: The3se issues are discussed at length byEasterly, Irwin and Serv\u00e9n (2007).\n\ns_08141: From Milanovic (2006, pp.\n\ns_08191: The variation in the value of college comes from the variation implied by the model in students' \"initial conditions\" -learning ability, 9 initial human capital, and initial wealth.\n\ns_08241: Authors Joe Champion and Vilma Mesa present disturbing evidence that by the time students enter the ninth grade, their mathematical knowledge, course placement, socio-economic status, and ethnicity almost completely predict whether they will complete a calculus course before graduation from high school.\n\ns_08268: Information presented in this brief is intended to increase awareness of existing national data related to this population as well as help educators and researchers better understand current methods for tracking information concerning college students and graduates with disabilities.\n\ns_08318: The data collection is based on news articles and government press releases and briefings.\n\ns_08368: Finally to confirm our findings using an alternative method we used SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) with only the discovery datasets, to examine whether SNPs found to be associated with the serum iron measures are enriched within associated SNPs with AD risk, and vice versa.\n\ns_08418: The number of selected features used to classify the subjects are shown in table 2.\n\ns_08468: The Ab Aggregate Hypothesis Is Reflected by Biomarker Studies in Humans Recent biomarker and imaging studies in living humans, along with classic postmortem studies from Braak and Braak (1997) , the Religious Order Study, and other human studies (Bennett, 2006; Blennow, 2004; Jack et al., 2009; Morris and Price, 2001; Perrin et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2009) , have begun to frame a theoretical average timeline for the development of various pathological features that characterize AD and the relationship to initial diagnosis of dementia or prodromal dementia (i.e., mild cognitive impairment due to AD).\n\ns_08518: Based on their collected data points, Barro and Lee (2013) interpolate/extrapolate the population by age and education between/from empirical data points forand backward.\n\ns_08568: 551 out of 819 participants (57 healthy control (HC), 388 MCI, 106 AD participants) had both FreeSurfer and RBM data available.\n\ns_08618: The number of rural 30-patient-waivered physicians per capita was significantly associated with more buprenorphine per capita dispensed in 2006, 2009, and   Table 3).\n\ns_08668: There is also the need to carry out an indebt examination to identify the dimensions of the problem for information that would be helpful in policy decisions to address the issue across the continent.\n\ns_08718: Gregg et al 35 gave a comprehensive list of ocean biological models with data assimilation and their applications of skill assessment, in both ecosystem/ biogeochemical and fisheries efforts.\n\ns_08768: These variables were captured by the following questions: i) \"Have you ever participated in any kind of health research study?\n\ns_08818: The ADNI dataset was split into training/validation and test sets.\n\ns_08868: In the US, for example, this has been illustrated by Silva (2013) , who has explored the effects of the ideological and structural changes on individual lives, focusing on the case of working class young adults.\n\ns_08918: For example, the abundances in species abundance distributions (SADs) have been found to often remain constant over large spatial and temporal scales (McGowan and Walker 1985 , Lawton and Gaston 1989 , Ebeling et al.\n\ns_08968: Also, regions with low forecasting skill may turn out to exhibit a bimodal distribution of breakup modes similar to Barrow, a potentially helpful insight for forecasting.\n\ns_09018: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that identifies factors associated with open campus policy holding."
