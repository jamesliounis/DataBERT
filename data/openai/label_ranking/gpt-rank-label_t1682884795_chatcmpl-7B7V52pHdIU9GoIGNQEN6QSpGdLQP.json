The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08676: Mathematics and science were again assessed in the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) and the Second International Science Study (SISS) in 1980-82 and1983-84 respectively.\n\ns_08726: The RMSE and Standard Deviation (SD) are required to be calculated, but these statistics have limited use since errors are not always expected to be normally distributed and CF is easier to explain to users lacking a technical background.\n\ns_08776: As shown in Table 2, no significant associations were found between respondents' areas of residence (rural/urban) and past participation, past opportunity, or willingness to participate in health research.\n\ns_08826: We ensured that age and sex distributions between training/validation and test sets were not significantly different.\n\ns_08876: This approach enabled us to collect a further 14 interviews, most of which were with youth that are often 'hard to reach', such as young people living in disadvantaged areas, with low socio-economic status, low skills and 'not in education and training' (NEET).\n\ns_08926: 1996 , Hadly and Maurer 2001 .\n\ns_08976: The range reported by Bilello [1980] for the complete removal of ice at Resolute was higher (120 to 190 melting degree days), similar to the respective range reported by Barry et al.\n\ns_09026: In this study, we described the prevalence of open campus policies among Oregon public high schools, and identified multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding.\n\ns_09076: To contrast, microwave imagers have a more recent appearance in TC analysis, with perhaps more potential for added value.\n\ns_09126: Recent studies have examined the role of different classes of biomarkers, cognitive measures, and genetic risk factors either in combination with a single imaging modality or independently for predicting conversion from MCI to AD [1, 2] .\n\ns_09176: The institution-level response rates shown in table 57 are the percentage of institutions that provided sufficient data to select the NPSAS:12 student-level sample; these rates are presented and discussed in the NPSAS:12 data file documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014, table 3, p. 11).\n\ns_09226: However, preliminary conclusions can be drawn at this point in several cases.\n\ns_09276: Figure 1 shows the smoothed activity counts per minute ( Figure 1A ) and cumulatively per day ( Figure 1B ) for each participant in the stratified groups: group 1 (green), group 2 (red), group 3 (blue), group 4 (orange).\n\ns_09326: (2)- (5), when R and R' are the ventricles and hippocampus regions within this volume of 16 slices respectively, as well as the and ventricle region size and the ventricle and hippocampus region divergence as our seven components feature vector.\n\ns_09376: The remaining voxels, of the order of 300,000 in our experiments, were detrended for age as recommended by (Dukart et al., 2011) and fed into the SVM classifier.\n\ns_09426: The BLSA study protocol was approved by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging and the Institutional Review Board of the MedStar Health Research Institute (Baltimore, MD).\n\ns_09476: Overall, these results showed that the Vero E6 and MA 104 cell lines can be efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_09526: Recombinant human ACE2 hascompleted clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively\nHighlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the RAS, together with implications for the COVID-19 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases [93] 6\nYi-Ming Yuan 2015\nTo explore the role of the Renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke Chronic cigarette exposure may result in PAH and affect the protein expression of ACE2 and ACE in lung tissue, suggesting that ACE2 and ACE play an important role in the pathogenesis of smokinginduced PAH [94] 7 Yingxia Liu 2020\nThe viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity.\n\ns_09576: The computation was based on reported means and standard deviations for 93% of the studies and inferred from F and t values in 7% of the studies.\n\ns_09626: The APE reported in this table are directly comparable to the OLS coefficients reported in column 1.\n\ns_09676: After we applied SCC to learn the sparse features, maxpooling [14] and SVM [15] were applied for additional dimension reduction and classification.\n\ns_09726: Our analysis focuses on the independent variable derived from the NELS:88 survey question: \"What kind of work do you expect to be doing when you are 30 years old?\"\n\ns_09776: These ROIs may offer enhanced clinical utility by utilizing information specific to PET signals.\n\ns_09826: Figures 13, 14, and 15 represent some examples of participants' responses.\n\ns_09876: measures of cell metabolism, which are known to be reduced for AD patients -Magnetic Resonance (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI) (for instance, ventricles volume), CSF and blood biomarkers, genetics, cognitive tests (ADAS-Cog), demographic and others."
