The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07032: Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat (2005) review this experience and conclude that over time overvaluation increased the likelihood of arriving at positive injury determinations.8 According toShetty (1995), by the mid 1980s, Taiwan and Korea represented 45% of world footwear exports but by 1994 their share had decreased to 7%.\n\ns_07082: More apt for our purposes are the models applied by Fan and co-authors to India and China (see Fan, Zhang, and Zhang (2002) , Fan Hazell and Haque (2000) , Fan and Chan-Kang (2004) ).\n\ns_07132: Our paper differs from the studies described above on one critical dimension.\n\ns_07182: In a recent article in The Economist magazine the authors write that \"cash transfers, with strings attached, are a better way of helping the poor than many previous social programs\" (The Economist 2005) .\n\ns_07232: Thus, the data suggest that new WTO members do more than old ones and that EU accession status does not imply a country will make deeper GATS commitments.\n\ns_07282: Since, following our earlier discussion, the cross-section selection bias for the pooled sample could overestimate the PC effects, greater confidence should be placed on the finding from the sample of participants.\n\ns_07332: The content of the Decision is summarized in Table 3 .1.\n\ns_07382: Concerning the main objective, the literature uncovers some stylized facts underlined in other literature reviews.\n\ns_07432: IS For all data sources see appendix 3 below.\n\ns_07482: (EBRI, pages 164 and 425).\n\ns_07532: The other study 28/ for a cross section of sixteen African countries (using period-average data) shows a strong positive relationship between export growth and GDP growth.\n\ns_07582: Thus national agencies receive material prepared by provincial agencies, which in turn rely on data compiled by municipal or county authorities, who base their reports on data from local enterprises.\n\ns_07632: The debt service relief provided to the country under each of the instruments may be calculated by comparing with the original debt service profile, and attributing the relief proportionally to each of the instruments.\n\ns_07682: In the case of cotton in the Cote d'lvoire, values for the variatles that vary by zone, their means, standard deviations, ininma and maxima, along with a list of the zones, are given in Table 1 .\n\ns_07732: The model used is a simple version of that proposed in Appendix II of Easterly et al (1989) and is based on the \"public finance approach to inflation\" literature discussed above.\n\ns_07782: In the leverage analysis, the data were searched for points that were farthest from the center \" For an excellent discussion of these issues, see Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980) , and Chatterjee and Hadi (1988) .\n\ns_07832: The limited amount of historical budget data available indicates 2 While these figures indicate that only 2% -5% of urban residents have no sanitation facilities, a very high percentage of those counted as having service is served with on-site latrines that are in very poor condition and would be classified as unhygienic service.\n\ns_07882: XQ/ See Bartholdy, Fisher and Mintz [1987] who estimate that a point increase in the corporate tax rate in Canada is associated with a three-quarter point increase in the debt-asset ratio.\n\ns_07932: The data presented in this study show that it is incorrect to imagine that a water authority without central government subventions is without resources.\n\ns_07982: As shown in Table 2 below, the rapid growth of the banks' loan portfolios in recent years (e.g., 44 percent in 2004 and 37 percent in 2005) should be monitored as it may expose systemic vulnerabilities in the months ahead.\n\ns_08032: 24 See Barnes, D.F., Krutilla, K., Hyde, W. 2004 income levels may lead to bias estimates.\n\ns_08082: The author may be contacted at lserven@worldbank.org.\n\ns_08132: 9 Gini2 is routinely calculated when published income distribution data are only reported as fractiles of the In the empirical work that follows, we shall depend almost entirely on social tables or tax census data obtained from secondary sources, including some estimates of our own.\n\ns_08182: First, the finding that the subsidy has the most value for already-well-prepared students suggests that the existing structure of support is not wholly consistent with the motivations that may drive subsidizing college, such as increasing equality of opportunity.\n\ns_08232: Though each intervention is distinctive, all share a recognition that high DFW rates are not acceptable, that what has been done is no longer working, and that sustained improvement requires multiple changes and strong departmental support."
