The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09090: The assimilation of additional ATMS data further reduced the bias of TC tracks and intensity as well as increased its lead time of forecasting.\n\ns_09140: ADNI FDG-PET images are co-registered to the talaraich atlas space using Neurostat [8] .\n\ns_09190: For a summary of findings from the BPS:12/17 pilot test, see appendix C. The BPS:12/17 student survey included items grouped by six key content areas: enrollment, education experiences, financial aid, employment, income and expenses, and background.\n\ns_09240: Since its commercialization in 1997, the proportion of cotton acres planted to RR cotton in the US increased from 4% to 70% (Gianessi & Carpenter, 2001; USDA NASS, various years).\n\ns_09290: Longitudinal analyses of the employment-activity relationship are warranted, specifically to determine if employment into the later years of life attenuates the decline in activity among those who remain employed.\n\ns_09340: Because the size of the ventricles is also a reliable indicator of AD, and because its segmentation can be done accurately, we also added this to the feature vector.\n\ns_09390: Linear regression plots for hippocampus volume detection on the standardized ADNI dataset using FreeSurfer (left) and MorphoBox (right).\n\ns_09440: Firstly, binary and ordered logistic regression models were used to assess the independent association of BMI with the presence and severity of AC, respectively.\n\ns_09490: This geographically dispersed cluster is known to be branched in the early period of the epidemic and genetically clustered very closely together.\n\ns_09540: In a study, 56 COVID-19 patients, 54% patients have high levels of serum Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) [81] .\n\ns_09590: b\nTo determine which age categories each study contributed to, identify the age at the midpoint between the ages listed under the Ages and time intervals column.\n\ns_09640: A statistically significant eight percentage point gender gap is also observed in homework participation, as 46% of girls did at least some homework on the diary day compared to only 38% of boys.\n\ns_09690: The results show the superiority of the proposed method over other cortical morphometry systems and offer a different way to study the early identification and prevention of AD.\n\ns_09740: For the physical science outcome, the coefficient at first attenuated from its initial value and then settled into a robust value after model 3.\n\ns_09790: Hence, 18F-FDG-PET is recognized as a potential tool for presymptomatic diagnosis of AD, offering acceptable sensitivity and accuracy.\n\ns_09840: Here, the findings related to the following three problems will be presented and discussed.\n\ns_09890: From the above, the negative log-likelihood of the data given the network is:\nWhere f c (.\n\ns_09940: In closing we note some questions relating to each of the three countries we think provide opportunities for fruitful research.\n\ns_09990: Mr. Duncan, Head of the Department of Education, said the estimate, based on an analysis of testing trends and the workings of the federal law's pass-fail school rating system, was the latest evidence of the law's shortcomings and the need to overhaul it.\n\ns_00042: Researchers interested in only this sort of data can apply to access the data from either NDAR or the other data repository.\n\ns_00092: There were 344 respondents with missing data for sex status; and 11,199 respondents who did not have a valid MCAT score were also excluded.\n\ns_00142: Breaking the coresident fathers into married and cohabiting groups might shed further light on the issue, but the numbers of married teen fathers were too small for meaningful descriptive analysis.\n\ns_00192: In SLCC, special care must be taken to ensure the neighborhoods are large enough to contain enough non-zero voxels, but small enough to capture statistics of specific regions of the scans.\n\ns_00242: On March 2, 2020, the first patient was detected in Argentina.\n\ns_00289: In 1999 researchers from the Mayo Clinic proposed quantitative criteria for identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a prodromal stage of AD [3] , focusing on the importance of memory impairment."
