The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00189: Since our primary aim is to achieve fast runtimes and high accuracy on clinical data, we first evaluate SparseVM and all baselines on the stroke MRI images.\n\ns_00239: There is no doubt that the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had great health and economic impact globally, although it is still difficult to measure it accurately.\n\ns_00286: We created an 'executive index', based on the TMT-B and COWAT, and an 'amnestic index', consisting of RAVLT-delayed recall and RCFT-delayed reproduction.\n\ns_00336: The CHAMP study was originally designed in order to investigate the health status in men older than 70 y living in a defined geographical region near the Concord Hospital in Sydney.\n\ns_00386: This standard approach allows these benefits to be estimated using generally available information about the size and type of operations rather than often-unavailable operationscale information about water and energy use or air and water emissions.\n\ns_00436: Cohen's d effect size measure was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the annual rate of change in MCSUVR.\n\ns_00486: Korean sample had a higher attribute prevalence than the Turkish sample (see Table 7 ).\n\ns_00536: However, the inclusion of many collinear climate predictors is often warranted when causal links between specific climate predictors and species' distributions are not established, leading to better model fit and projections [47] .\n\ns_00586: The discovery that dopamine was depleted in Parkinson disease led to the development of dopamine replacement therapy, and elucidation of the brain circuitry that is perturbed in Parkinson disease led to treatment with deep brain stimulation that transforms the lives of patients in the middle stage of the disease.\n\ns_00636: Similar to SARS-CoV, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells.\n\ns_00678: According to this estimate, salinity stratification increases CI by about 8.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , of which only about 27% are caused by the Amazon and Orinoco.\n\ns_00728: The sure indexes were constructed for each county for simplest, \"back of the envelope\" approach to es-1992.\n\ns_00778: These results are similar to those found in previous research examining the eighth grade science gap, which also found that prior achievement left the majority of such racial gaps unexplained (Quinn & Cooc, 2015).\n\ns_00828: A district official concurred as follows: The observation findings indicate that, in order to promote greater interaction among the participants, the venue for the contact sessions was reviewed.\n\ns_00878: Conversion of grasslands to intensive cultivation has reduced the amount of preferred habitat that is available to Ferruginous Hawks and has been implicated in the population decline of the species in some areas (Schmutz, 1984; Faanes and Lingle, 1995) .\n\ns_00928: Benefiting from the flexible architecture of proposed deep model, the performance of our method might be further improved if multimodality information is taken into account, e.g., PET imaging and CSF biomarkers (Liu et al., 2015a) .\n\ns_00978: Figure 1 shows u 95 (\u03c6, \u03bb), the 95th percentile of the local winter wind intensity u(\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 ) = | \u2212 \u2192 u (\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 )|.\n\ns_01028: An example of an upper stage propellant management simulation will be presented and compared to EUCES, a tool used at Astrium based on EcosimPro.\n\ns_01078: The Tukey-Kramer tests and regression analysis show that both farm and nonfarm households follow the life-cycle pattern for income and net worth.\n\ns_01128: All models adjusted for children's baseline skills; that is, we estimate whether classroom age composition was associated with changes in children's school readiness outcomes, which is one of the strongest adjustments for omitted variable bias (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network & Duncan, 2003) .\n\ns_01178: The accuracy of the SLOSH model predictions of storm surge strongly depends on the quality of the forecast guidance data provided by the US National Hurricane Center Fig.\n\ns_01228: When enriching for more severe disease using baseline MMSE, a slightly larger slope (rate of decline) was observed but offset by a large reduction in the size of the available sample in the meta-database meeting the MMSE cutoff.\n\ns_01278: Importantly, the index highlighted the need for common standards to be able to compare and benchmark progress.\n\ns_01328: First, because most studies were cross-sectional and started in adulthood, it was impossible to distinguish associations that may reflect a causal pathway from those that may be spurious.\n\ns_01378: Key steps for future progress in the field include the validation of prognostic and predictive algorithms in independent datasets from other projects (ie, external validation)."
