The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00173: This enables more detailed analyses on a variety of anatomical regions than is possible with the clinical dataset.\n\ns_00223: That means, even if those data are updated continuously, they are not a replacement for the vital statistics provided by each country.\n\ns_00270: Values denote means \u00b1 SD with maximum ranges in parentheses.\n\ns_00320: 3, 95 provided a lot of data on the relationship between gonadal status and sexual desire, sexual function, and erectile function in middle-aged to older men ( Table 3 ), suggesting that loss of sexual desire, but not erectile function, is strictly related to low T in aging men 96 and could be predictive for the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) 94 Thus, low serum T (the main component of low desire) is indirectly related to the onset of ED and to impaired male sexual function.\n\ns_00370: Estimates of regional energy use for pumping irrigation water were calculated using data on average regional well characteristics from FRIS data.\n\ns_00420: It is observed that cerebellar cortex referencing led to the smallest test-retest variability ( Table 5) , while the other reference regions did not differ significantly.\n\ns_00470: Fit statistics for DINA model analyses are presented in Table 4 .\n\ns_00520: The scales ranged from 335 ha to 32,200 ha and were based on buffering the segments with radii: 0.2-km, 0.4- The positive and negative rates show the models ability to correctly predict presence and absence data points in the withheld data based on a 0.5 threshold for classification.\n\ns_00570: The key factors that now motivate a proposal for an initiative on brain disorders are the rapidly advancing tools and knowledge to facilitate understanding of disease mechanisms, a strong and growing scientific workforce in neuroscience, and a substantial mismatch between research investment and unmet medical need, global disease burden, and rising costs to societies (Bloom et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2013) .\n\ns_00620: Overall, the findings of this study are reassuring and suggest low risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_00662: The coefficients are calculated applying the updated version [Lee et al., 2009] of the quasi analytical algorithm, developed by Lee et al.\n\ns_00712: The optimal levels of estimate s som30e.wha higer tar-thoel derived from experimental data.\n\ns_00762: Further details on the construction of the SES composite measure can be found in the ECLS-K users' manual (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b) Finally, we used school identifiers that uniquely identify schools, allowing for the inclusion of school-fixed effects in the analysis.\n\ns_00812: Triangulation can be useful in facilitating cross-data validity checks (Patton, 2002) .\n\ns_00862: When converting land from sagebrush steppe to grassland, Ferruginous Hawks will benefit from the creation of a mosaic of treated (chained or disked) and untreated areas (Howard and Wolfe, 1976) .\n\ns_00912: These hippocampus regions, referred to as hippocampal MRI images hereafter, were used as the input to the proposed deep ordinal ranking model.\n\ns_00962: Furthermore, the SST recovery time scale has been estimated on the scale of a couple of weeks (Sanford et al., 2007; Price et al., 2008; , as an effect of anomalous air-sea fluxes and mixed layer baroclinic instabilities associated with the front induced by the localized mixing (Boccaletti et al., 2007; Mei and Pasquero, 2012) .\n\ns_01012: EUCES has been extensively tested.\n\ns_01062: The results shown in tables 7 and 8 indicate that in comparison to the age group of less than 34 years, both farm and nonfarm households generally exhibit higher incomes and net worth later in life, with the exception of farm household's income with heads older than 65 years.\n\ns_01112: It is important to note that all nonfocal variables in Table 1 serve as covariates in all analyses.\n\ns_01162: c Pre-Rita TCHP map under the 'with warm eddy encountering' scenario, as derived from the observed SSHA in (a).\n\ns_01212: However, most of the differences in ADAS-Cog scores at the end of the trial were due to differences in baseline scores, as shown by the wide separation of groups at month 0. for baseline MMSE scores of 12-22 instead of 12-26 resulted in a difference of less than one point per year on the ADAS-Cog, but reduced the available sample pool by more than 800 subjects.\n\ns_01262: This is related to the individual, the organization and public contexts when operating such technologies.\n\ns_01312: In that study, Angst and colleagues (2002) found that atypical depression was characterized by greater longitudinal chronicity [38] .\n\ns_01362: 77 With both legacy and newly collected data, supervised machine learning approaches 31 will be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (eg, psychosis onset, social and role functioning, changes in symptom scores, and treatment response) from both neuroimaging and nonneuroimaging data."
