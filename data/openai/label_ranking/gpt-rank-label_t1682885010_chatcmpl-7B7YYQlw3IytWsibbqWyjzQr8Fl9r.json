The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03655: From an analytical perspective, it is important to note that the shifts in trade are likely to be a direct consequence of the shifts in the economy via the -gravity\u2016 effect.\n\ns_03705: The authors reach the conclusion that credible hard budget constraints on service providers, a comprehensive regulatory framework, and independent regulatory and supervisory bodies are important to contain the fiscal risks associated with PPPs.\n\ns_03755: The table shows that the share of disadvantaged beneficiaries in India is about 83%, consistent with the expectations when the legal system permits abstract policy review and cases focus on regulation.\n\ns_03805: Table 7 summarizes the results for our four main specifications after substituting in for BRENT from the preceding expression.\n\ns_03855: More precisely, Table 3 describes the distribution of allocations to the later period, in kwacha.\n\ns_03905: In some cases, however, the figures may be based on damages in an earlier year if that was the latest information available (see later sections for details).\n\ns_03955: (1975) and Stosky and WoldeMariam (1997) .\n\ns_04005: The three sampled regions vary signicantly in several aspects that are potentially relevant for the analysis, such as HIV prevalence rates, polygamy rates, and schooling levels.\n\ns_04055: As the authors of the study note, the challenge is to find out which factors enabled the low-inequality to states to reach the poor to see if there are lessons to be leamed for the delivery of immunization services in the high-inequality states.\n\ns_04105: There may be some practical problems in defining benchmark portfolios, although these difficulties should not be exaggerated since benchmarks are widely used by pension funds to monitor the performance of asset managers.\n\ns_04155: (2012), among many others.\n\ns_04205: Proposition 2 An increase in Em, which can then be interpreted as a (meanpreserving) increase in volatility, reduces optimal employment.\n\ns_04255: However, as noted in section 5, while this assumption is convenient for exposition, it is not really necessary for country k to be able to observe country j's effort.\n\ns_04305: While the overwhelming majority of literature in this field uses quarterly data, this study uses monthly data, in order to capture intra-quarter volatility.\n\ns_04355: The first step of this procedure consists of estimating the probability that a household enrols in a particular school sector as a function of the individual specific regressors as well as a districtsector-time fixed effect.\n\ns_04405: Estimated coefficients on the interaction terms are reported in Table 4 .\n\ns_04455: Column 3 shows each 100\u20ac more remitted when given the labeling option is associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of take-up, which is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.\n\ns_04505: However, research using data covering periods of recessions also shows that wages are very rarely cut (Agell and Lundborg, 2003) .\n\ns_04555: Most of the outcome indicators investigated by de Barros et al.\n\ns_04605: We follow the single-equation approach advocated by Jorda (2005) In particular, LP (i) can be estimated by single-regression techniques (least-squares dummy 7 The list of OECD countries comprises Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Rep., Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.\n\ns_04655: This is done by decomposing the changes in HOI by scale and distribution effects, given the index is additively decomposable (Barros et al., 2009) .\n\ns_04705: By using U.S. data on publicly traded firms, Rajan and Zingales (1998) increase the likelihood that they correctly identify a sector's technological demand for external financing.\n\ns_04755: To assess whether second-generation effects are plausible and to trace channels through which they might materialize, we complement evidence on second-generation effects with exploration of HSAA-induced impacts on the parent generation.\n\ns_04805: The calibrated values of parameter A are A = 0.0163 for the Townsend-Thai dataset and A = 0.0082 for the SES dataset.\n\ns_04855: There is a theoretical literature on government subsidies and entrepreneurial activity (see Li, 2002 for a review)."
