The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01510: Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the geographic distribution of the USGS categories identifi ed as the dominant type (Table 1) in each CWRF 30-km grid and the USDA county-level harvested cotton acreage averaged during 1979 to 2005.\n\ns_01560: The comparisons of the bed changes at the ten stations computed by using the calibrated parameters are shown in Figure 3 (b) ; it indicates that an excellent agreement between the measurements and observations was obtained at these selected stations in the estuary.\n\ns_01610: Secondly, we use air travel data from important destinations in Colombia but other locations may also have fueled COVID-19 emergence and dissemination in the country; flight travel data was not available from March 9, 2020, onwards.\n\ns_01660: Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the influence that choice of analysis method has on the results.\n\ns_01710: 22 As data quality made it impossible to distinguish between stage II and stage III lesions, the SEER staging criteria groupings were applied as follows: (1) Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.\n\ns_01760: Second, the proposed method is capable of handling block-wise missing data which might not contain any complete observations, while most traditional methods, including the matrix completion [5] , require partial subjects to have fully completed observations.\n\ns_01810: To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a spatial filtering approach to examine the mortality pattern across US counties.\n\ns_01860: These characteristics were used in this project to link students in each of the data sets, thereby creating a \"synthetic cohort,\" to provide values for variables missing in the NELS:88/94 data set.\n\ns_01910: Therefore, the creation of AD centers and Udall Parkinson's Disease Centers in the United States, and other initiatives in Europe [e6] and Australia [e7] , is enabling researchers to access standardized, high-quality samples from patients with NDs in collaboration with clinicians.\n\ns_01960: Previous research supports the psychometric validity of the scale across a range of diverse populations (Kliem et al.\n\ns_02010: These findings were highly statistically significant and suggest that length of time learning to play an instrument is a better predictor of average points score at KS4 than English level at KS2 and is almost as good as mathematics at KS2 (for further details see Table 3) .\n\ns_02060: 19 The viral metagenomic study speculated the deaths of these pangolins might be associated with coronaviruses.\n\ns_02110: In Costa Rica data, the National Cancer Registry records cases as urban, rural, or semiurban according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) criteria.\n\ns_02160: The highly co-cited papers is seen as the core knowledge base of research area at a particular period.\n\ns_02210: Gait speed decline was defined as a loss of \u22650.05m/sec/ year; memory decline was defined as cohort specific bottom slope tertile.\n\ns_02243: As such, the investigators within ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI or provided data but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this article.\n\ns_02293: This computation was performed for the 2016 central estimate and upper-bound and lower-bound estimates of the EAB, then also for the same for 2055.\n\ns_02343: For significant interactions, we performed follow-up analyses for each baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion group (35) to assess whether a significant linear association existed between HOMA-IR and FDG metabolism in one or more groups.\n\ns_02393: Whitney and Codiga, 2011; Whitney et al.,\n\ns_02443: PCP characteristics of interest included sex, years in practice, specialty, credential type, international medical graduate status, patient panel size, and practice location in terms of region and rurality.\n\ns_02493: In addition, we evaluated the performance of bidirectional LSTMs combining CNN estimates with site frequency-based population genetic statistics such as TajD Figure 3) .\n\ns_02543: The quantiles for visits to information providers are the values that divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile.\n\ns_02593: MetS can be established based on parallel criteria from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) from 2001, with subsequent modification in 2004 [4] [5] [6] .\n\ns_02643: In the same study, increased cortisol levels were associated with some microstructural changes, specifically in the corpus callosum and the posterior corona radiate (EchouffoTcheugui et al., 2018) .\n\ns_02693: If it is not, CBAA will 15 If the elimination of affirmative action causes black application rates to become like those of whites, the appropriate comparison is of row 1 in Table 1 to rows 2 through 8 of Table 2. be a blunt tool for achieving racial diversity."
