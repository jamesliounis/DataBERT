The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06836: This paper provides an explanation of the asset-based conceptual framework, including a review of the literature.\n\ns_06886: Indeed, if one just focuses on the 18 observations in this data set for SSA then one finds no correlation between death rates and the incidence of poverty.\n\ns_06936: To see how the theory is affected, seeDas et al.\n\ns_06986: Table 1 shows the distribution of our sample across housing categories encountered in Bhopal.\n\ns_07036: There are three aspects of the case that are important to consider in the context of this paper: i) the economic and political problem underlying the dispute, ii) the determinations of the Special Group and the Appellate Body and, iii) the impact on and the response by Argentina.\n\ns_07086: Tables 1-5, and population density maps (figure 2), provide a more accurate representation of population breakdowns.\n\ns_07136: first model includes GDP per Capita and legal origin as the explanatory variables as reported in Table 5 .\n\ns_07186: Todd and Wolpin (2003) use data on PROGRESA, and Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Leite (2003) use data on the Brazilian Bolsa Escola program (now renamed Bolsa Familia) to simulate the impact of conditional and unconditional cash transfers; both papers conclude that the bulk of the enrollment effects are a result of the price change implicit in the condition, rather than the income effect associated with the cash transfer.\n\ns_07236: Table 6 also provides information on the correlation between timing of WTO commitments and actual policy (reform) measures.\n\ns_07286: [ Table 4 inserted here ]\n\ns_07336: Information from Japan allows comparison of trade administrative costs under a customs system based on electronic data input versus a system based on paper.\n\ns_07386: Section 3 reviews some empirical studies.\n\ns_07436: * The analysis carried out in the paper, both in terms of means and incremental (marginal) effects, shows that total grants have enabled all recipient countries to expand their import capacity.\n\ns_07486: In the conclusions we discuss how to organize joint collection in a setting with multiple providers of pension services.\n\ns_07536: program on SSA export performance was positive and highly significant.\n\ns_07586: 17 We can investigate the consistency of the data for energy consumption (not shown) and energy consumption per unit of GVIO by extracting the implicit branch figures for GVIO and comparing them with GVIO data from other sources.\n\ns_07636: It refers to the same set of banks, but allows for the fact that they have also sacrificed something in the sense that their existing claims have not been fully serviced.\n\ns_07686: For instance, the minimum total lag in evacuationi (col.2 -col.\n\ns_07736: The empirical nature of the study calls for a caveat.\n\ns_07786: The theoretical model is applied to data from the Peru Living Standards Survey (PLSS).\n\ns_07836: 3.27 Near the end of project implementation, PMO would prepare an Implementation Completion Report, the contents and format of which would be agreed upon during the last World Bank supervision mission.\n\ns_07886: If the firm uses retentions as a source of finance, the relevant tax rate is c. If dividends convey information to the market, the effective personal tax rate on equity income may be a weighted average of personal dividend and capital gains taxes (Poterba and Summers (19851) .\n\ns_07936: After explaining that the survey was part of a World Bank study, the enumerator read each respondent a carefully-worded statement that was designed to set the scene for the \"bidding game\" in which respondents would tell whether or not they would be willing to pay certain specified amounts for water under certain circumstances.\n\ns_07986: See Kane / Demirguc-Kunt (2001).20 See graph in Annex / This much reported decrease in Sberbank's share of deposits, for instance, seems to be more linked to the closing of more than a third of its branches since 2001, rather than to a weakening of its market leadership position.\n\ns_08036: Since we do not have data about the feasibility of switching to fuelwood, our model may over predict the extent switching to fuelwood occurs."
