The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05047: Table 4 tend to confirm the results of Table 3 .\n\ns_05097: Data, Information, and Monitoring One substantial challenge to improving the state of ECD in Morocco and reducing inequality is the lack of data available on ECD.\n\ns_05147: In the robustness exercises, I show how alternative values of affect the results of the analysis.\n\ns_05197: Unfortunately, we lack the data to test whether the change in utilization among eligible and ineligible children is due to economies of scale with respect to travel or time costs, such as parents taking insured children with them to the doctor.\n\ns_05247: For instance, Martins and Moura e S\u00e1 (2011) validate for the water sector a result that is already quite well established in energy regulation: the poorest tend to be penalized by the excessive complexity of billing and payment options.\n\ns_05297: 1 It also shows that given the current pattern of coverage, states which lag behind in enrollment rate and income tend to have higher elasticities.\n\ns_05347: The two methodologies are complementary in the sense that they show different aspects of the data.\n\ns_05397: The rapid consumption methodology is applied ex post to household budget data collected in Hargeisa, Somalia.\n\ns_05447: Specifically, he uses U.S. affiliate sales data in 39 countries and 50 manufacturing industries from the BEA Benchmark Survey of 1994 and finds that U.S. multinational firms from unskilledlabor intensive industries tend to invest in unskilled-labor abundant countries, a result consistent with the hypothesis that countries' factor endowment differences lead to vertical FDI.\n\ns_05497: Refining the methodology and expanding the data collection coverage can lead to the creation of a relevant set of indicators, can generate a global public database on bureaucratic quality, and can foster policy dialogue around key areas of public service provision.\n\ns_05547: When applying these indexes to other developing countries that do not have a STEP survey, we use those calculated for the pooled sample (i.e.\n\ns_05597: RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 are part of a new set of scenarios used in the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase of the World Climate Research Programme.\n\ns_05647: Fuente: estimaciones a partir de la ENCEL 2017.\n\ns_05697: This situation can be mapped into a control and flexibility quadrant, as developed in figure 2.\n\ns_05747: Table A1 in the Appendix provides more details on these variables.\n\ns_05797: A short baseline survey was conducted on the phone or online upon enrollment in the study to provide basic background on the firm, including characteristics that can be used to examine what factors help predict willingness to pay.\n\ns_05847: For our econometric tests, we generate matching CAMS-3 data by computing average measures for the corresponding intervals.\n\ns_05897: Source: Authors estimation using data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys.\n\ns_05947: Since some countries joined the euro area during the sample period, we do not group member states solely based on the dates joined but also based on the number of observations in the two periods.\n\ns_05997: The impact of several alternative modeling strategies is then explored, including disaggregation of the sample by geographic region, and the impact of alternative ways of modeling the influence of income on uptake decisions.\n\ns_06047: In line with existing empirical papers based on data for developed countries, both samples also show that the e\u00a4ect on output is mainly driven by private consumption whereas private investment remains largely unchanged.\n\ns_06097: Given that the semi-parametric Cox model is robust to arbitrary distributional assumptions, it is our preferred specification for the remainder of the paper.\n\ns_06147: We contribute to the literature on undocumented migration, which is rather sparse given the lack of data.\n\ns_06197: This is followed by an overview of the setting and methodology used.\n\ns_06247: We follow these studies and impute rural and urban revised 2011 PPPs and 2017 PPPs for these three countries, using the share of price collection outlets in urban areas, the ratio of urban to rural poverty lines in the ICP reference year, and the national PPP as inputs (see Table B .4 for more details)."
