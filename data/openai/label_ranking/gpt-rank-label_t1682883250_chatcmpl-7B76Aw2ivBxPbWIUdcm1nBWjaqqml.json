The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01191: Analyses were performed using version 3.0.3 of the R programming environment [24] .\n\ns_01241: This was done to identify relevant studies which informed the outline of our digital literacy framework and involved performing a keyword and title search for journal articles across academic databases.\n\ns_01291: Our search identified 521 papers, 46 of which satisfied selection criteria.\n\ns_01341: Multicenter studies provide a means of acquiring data from relatively large samples of subjects, representing different geographical areas.\n\ns_01391: We evaluated the validity of such eigenvalues at the 95% significance level, assuming as null hypothesis that a dataset is randomly drawn from a population number of uncorrelated Gaussian variables (Overland and Preisendorfer, 1982) .\n\ns_01441: In addition, the study provides results of an analysis of the 1999 National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) and the 2001 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), which include more-limited information on grant funding provided by all federal agencies.\n\ns_01491: Annual cotton yield data for each county available from the NASS archive were used as the reference to evaluate GOSSYM simulations.\n\ns_01541: For the details of the model, one may refer to Ding et al.\n\ns_01591: However, more sequence data from Colombia and undersampled countries together with information of sampling representativeness per country is needed in order to account for sampling uncertainty in a more statistically rigorous manner.\n\ns_01641: [83] , which is based on Thirion and Calmon [84] , and that by Pieperhoff et al.\n\ns_01691: All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS University Edition software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\n\ns_01741: We also investigate the performance of the proposed method under high-dimensional situations in the following Setting 2.\n\ns_01791: In this study, we use the Tiefelsdorf and Griffith [51] approach; details of how to implement this approach can be found in Chun and Griffith [72] .\n\ns_01841: The next section briefly describes this data set.\n\ns_01891: In this article, we describe the integrative approach of this biobank together with the different clinical centers [30] that gather clinical data, and genetic and biofluid samples and brains of wellcharacterized, longitudinally monitored patients with different NDs at UPenn (Fig.\n\ns_01941: Our analytic plan, for the current paper, was conducted across three complimentary phases as follows:\n(1) A series of descriptive analyses were conducted to present an overview of the key sociodemographic characteristics of the entire sample (N = 1989) for the baseline data of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study.\n\ns_01991: An analysis using the data relating to how long the students had been playing revealed a multiple R of .593 with an adjusted R 2 of .34 (F(2,112) = 30.37, p < ,0001).\n\ns_02041: Using the same technique, Shi et al.\n\ns_02091: The aforementioned data sources were reviewed for incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases for the time periods of available data specific to each nation.\n\ns_02141: The insights that we draw from our analysis of the 9146 papers is presented in different sections below\n\ns_02191: Data are from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n=662, 51%women,22%blacks), Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (n=746, 51%women,44%blacks), and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (n=2771, 48%women,0.3%blacks).\n\ns_02224: Analyses were performed using statistical software (SAS software version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Inc).\n\ns_02274: A recent submitted paper summarizes the methods including details of historical data, validations, storm climatology development, and statistical analysis [Orton et al., submitted].\n\ns_02324: For example, when testing five ROIs, a P value of 0.010 is needed among one of the tested ROIs for the test to achieve significance, followed by 0.013, 0.017, 0.025, and 0.050.\n\ns_02374: Journal of 663 Computational Science, 21(3), 251-269. doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(76)90023-1."
