The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09215: As more useful farm-level data become available for economic comparisons\uf8e7both in the US and, more particularly, in the rest of the world\uf8e7estimates of this type can be viewed with more confidence.\n\ns_09265: To further explore the relationship between employment and daily activity counts, each group was stratified by employment status (employed/not employed): group 1 (115/27 participants), group 2 (88/59 participants), group 3 (61/96 participants), group 4, (23/142 participants) and a two group t test was used to formally test for differences in the log of cumulative daily activity counts by employment status.\n\ns_09315: In order to facilitate the diagnostic analysis, we built a user interface that can visualize the deformation within the structures we want to study, and can facilitate the selection of the regions for which we want to measure the local and inter-structural effects of atrophy.\n\ns_09365: by focusing on temporal regions, might prove more effective in such classification tasks involving localized statistical differences between the populations to be compared.\n\ns_09415: Variables known to potentially affect AC and/or showing significant univariate associations with it were entered in multivariable models.\n\ns_09465: Recently, a study showed that the Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited to SARS--CoV-2 specific CPE.\n\ns_09515: Moreover, aspects of SARS-COV-2 etioclinio-pathogenesis and replication depicted inside infected cells might help in development of present and future prospects of ongoing clinical trials.\n\ns_09565: We will first present data for each trait across the life course or the portion of the life course for which there were enough studies to make estimates.\n\ns_09615: We document robust, statistically significant one-hour weekly gender gaps in secondary students' non-school study time using time-diary data from the 2003-2012 waves of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and transcript data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS).\n\ns_09665: These summary statistics are much lower in dimension than the original data.\n\ns_09715: Researchers conducted additional surveys in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000.\n\ns_09765: Figure 3 shows the average of standardized uptake value ratio of samples in all ROIs.\n\ns_09815: A literature review revealed a complex range of studies that reflect a need to develop mathematics teachers' problemsolving skills and strategies and indicate that these needs are varied and dependent upon specific domains (Bruun, 2013; Evans, 2012; Fang, 2012; Munroe, 2015; Tekin Sitrava, 2018) .\n\ns_09865: LSTMs) and standard methods from biostatistics (i.e.\n\ns_09915: A more disaggregated analysis would give a better idea of how this immigration affected Israeli comparative advantage in software.\n\ns_09965: The affluent districts in Tables 2 and 3 by high years are challenged by high school drop rates for minority students who are disproprotionately represented in the low-income student category in such school districts This helps to reduce the low-income student impact at the high school level (from roughly (-12 to-3 in terms of statistical significance).\n\ns_00017: Allowing easy download of the data associated with a publication facilitates the replication and extension of results.\n\ns_00067: This approach allows researchers to identify potential problems with the analysis and to clearly identify the apparent \"impact\" of each new variable as it is introduced into the analysis.\n\ns_00117: Coley and Chase-Lansdale (1998) noted that more research needs to be conducted in this area.\n\ns_00167: ACM CHIL '20, April 2-4, 2020, Toronto, ON, Canada themselves are used in clinical studies to understand anatomical differences between scans.\n\ns_00217: To compare deaths and cases by sex and age in a given date, we decided to consider data reported until September 30, 2020.\n\ns_00264: From the GO-MCI database, we identified MCI patients with amnestic, nonamnestic executive and multidomain impairment at baseline evaluation, based on neuropsychological criteria (see below).\n\ns_00314: Main similarities and differences of large longitudinal, cohort studies.\n\ns_00364: (2013) and our best professional judgment for larger scale reductions in nutrient application and runoff (Tables 3 and 4) .\n\ns_00414: PVC based analysis generated significantly (p<0.0005) larger longitudinal percent change in MCSUVR regardless of the reference regions used ( Table 4 )."
