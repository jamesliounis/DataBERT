The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08835: The AIBL dataset was used as an independent test set to assess the CNN generalization ability.\n\ns_08885: Beck (2007) claimed that this shift is part of the wider process of individualization taking place at a structural level.\n\ns_08935: Most biologists know that the central limit theorem (CLT) of statistics (Grimmett and Stirzaker 1992) states that we should find normal distributions any time many variables interact additively.\n\ns_08985: For example, investigating which of the two ice decay modes dominates at a particular location may guide the selection of indicators for breakup forecasts in the Canadian Arctic and elsewhere; for example, leading to the use of predominantly dynamic indicators in exposed areas and thermodynamic indicators in sheltered areas.\n\ns_09035: An extensive body of research attributes youth dietary behavior to varied cognitive, affective, habitual, and environmental influences [2] .\n\ns_09085: This image uses the model output from the ECMWF experiments, showing where Sandy was predicted to be located 5-days out with the normal satellite data inputs into the model (left) and without any polar-orbiting satellite data (right).\n\ns_09135: In this article, we present a unified framework to combine the high-dimensional information available from multiple imaging modalities, anatomical shape atrophy (derived from MRI) and neuronal hypometabolism (derived from FDG-PET), with other low-dimensional biomarkers, such as APOE carrier status, A\u03b2-42 and ptau 181 concentration.\n\ns_09185: To review the study brochure, click here (PDF brochure).\n\ns_09235: It is time also for an initial attempt to quantify the nonpecuniary benefits and to gain a better sense of the economics of the spatial and intertemporal (externality) effects of conventional versus transgenic technologies regarding their pest resistance and biodiversity consequences.\n\ns_09285: Based on these analyses, the continuous relationship between log activity counts and age was modeled using three multiple linear regression models with increased levels of adjustment for sex, body mass index (BMI), functional status (gait speed), employment status, race, education, and comorbidities.\n\ns_09335: In order to perform a quantitative analysis, transformations of images into one another need to be defined and calculated, after which the diagnosis can be facilitated through the calculation of \"diagnostic parameters\".\n\ns_09385: In each classification scenario, we compared classification performances from three distinct feature sets: normalized voxelwise GM concentrations computed via SPM and a set of a priori chosen volumes extracted using either FreeSurfer or MorphoBox.\n\ns_09435: Interestingly, in this BMD-adjusted model, the size of the odds ratio for BMI associated with lower AC was reduced by about 14% and was no longer statistically significant (OR 0.967, 95%CI 0.932-1.003, p=0.0729).\n\ns_09485: SARS-CoV-2 replicated with a similar kinetics in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, but the MA-104 cells supported replication of SARS-CoV-2 slightly less well than the Vero E6 cells (Fig 6A) .\n\ns_09535: Two broadly classified techniques include, Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based detection and serology-based detection.\n\ns_09585: Many of these effects were replicated in a longitudinal study of men and women, in which, for example, it was found that occupational success was related to increases in dominance, whereas satisfaction was associated with decreases in negative emotionality (Roberts, Caspi, & Moffitt, 2003) .\n\ns_09635: As a result, the gender gaps identified in analyses of the ELS data likely represent lower bounds of the true gender gap.\n\ns_09685: The results show regionally variant patterns of discrimination ability, with over 90% accuracy, but the subject amounts are relative small.\n\ns_09735: Our analysis included two outcome comparisons in earned baccalaureate degrees: (i) earning degrees in life sciences versus nonscience areas and (ii) earning degrees in physical sciences/engineering versus nonscience areas.\n\ns_09785: Therefore, only a small amount of a sample can train a good classifier using a DBN, which has obvious advantages in the recognition of a small sample.\n\ns_09835: The second aspect of the analysis concentrated on which problem-solving strategies the participants used.\n\ns_09885: For our current architecture, where we group similar tasks into task-specific layers, our loss function corresponds to:\nGiven that survival predictions are the primary focus of many longitudinal studies, we set \u03b1 c = \u03b1 b = 1 and include \u03b1 T as an additional hyperparameter to be optimized.\n\ns_09935: 32 However, the available evidence suggests that the probability of migrants returning declines with time -hence very few of those who stay for a decade return in the first place.\n\ns_09985: Salaries and years of experience are averages for schools districts.The data for the variables are only for the top ten highest paid high school principals in the state of Illinois.\n\ns_00037: genetic data) generated by researchers who accessed the tissue."
