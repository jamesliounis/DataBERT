The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08455: One valid critique of the hypothesis is that most of the experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis comes from the study of the genetic alterations that cause familial autosomal dominant AD (Selkoe, 2001; Younkin, 1998) .\n\ns_08505: The dataset is constructed around collected and harmonized empirical census and survey data sets for the projection base year.\n\ns_08555: 1) were included in this study.\n\ns_08605: Methods: Using 2004-2011 state-level data on buprenorphine dispensed and county-level data on the number of buprenorphine-waivered physicians and substance abuse treatment facilities using buprenorphine, we estimated a multivariate ordinary least squares regression model with state fixed effects of a state's annual total buprenorphine dispensed per capita as a function of the state's number of buprenorphine providers.\n\ns_08655: The sampling plan for the selection of the participating students was developed with the help of Statistics Canada, which was also supportive in guiding the sampling process.\n\ns_08705: A Pattern Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was used by Robinson et al 32 to evaluate salinity fields.\n\ns_08755: Table 3 shows the results of multivariable logistic regression models for \"ever participated in health research\" and \"opportunity to participate in health research.\"\n\ns_08805: Different experiments were conducted to assess whether the method was robust enough to help interpret the results of the CNN.\n\ns_08855: This web survey was completed by 2,025 young people aged 22-29 in England, Scotland and Wales, and for the purposes of this article (and to match the qualitative data), we focus here on the responses from 1,003 young participants from England.\n\ns_08905: The results are presented in Table 3 .\n\ns_08955: Here, we summarize these observations through specific examples.\n\ns_09005: Table 3 have statistically significant model chi-square values, which suggest the models significantly and reliably predict a school's open campus policy.\n\ns_09055: A statistical analysis of the distribution of temperatures with respect to TC axisymmetry (the deviation angle variance technique) continues to show great promise in not only diagnosing structure, but also helping with TC centering, genesis, and intensity [29] .\n\ns_09105: The corresponding clinical test score, the CSF-biomarker data and the APOE genotype information were also retrieved.\n\ns_09155: Project staff collected CPS data, which come from the FAFSA, for the BPS:12/17 sample for the 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 financial aid years.\n\ns_09205: They used unpublished market survey data, as well as published agronomic and farmer survey data to estimate their supply shifts in the US and assumed that the ROW would experience either the same or half of the efficiency gains as the US.\n\ns_09255: Actiheart data was downloaded using commercial software (Actilife, version 4.0.32) to derive activity counts per minute.\n\ns_09305: This field can then be used to calculate the (diagnostic) parameters (See, e.g., refs.\n\ns_09355: Data used in the disease classification experiments described in the following were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).\n\ns_09405: However, this finding may have been due to the presence of more severe AC in the older age group, and the hypothesis that BMD mediates the association of BMI with AC needs to be further tested in specifically selected populations.\n\ns_09455: The reads were aligned to the previously assembled sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank Accession: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner v.0.7.1 with the MEM algorithm [25] .\n\ns_09505: Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health researchers on January 7, 2020 jointly revealed the origin of this coronavirus from a seafood market in Wuhan city [6] .\n\ns_09555: Because the latter studies used repeated measures F and t test results, we transformed these scores into the raw score metric by using formulas provided by Morris and Deshon (2002) .\n\ns_09605: (2002) used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS88) to show that time spent on homework had positive effects on math and science test scores.\n\ns_09655: All subjects underwent thorough clinical and cognitive assessment at the time of acquisition, the statistics with gender, age and the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score shown in Table."
