The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00946: In Section 20 3 we discuss the results of this analysis.\n\ns_00996: Some models have been adapted or added and some will be implemented in the future.\n\ns_01046: Milligan (2004) found similar results using data from Canada.\n\ns_01096: Table 1 provides sample descriptives and comparisons of children across age cohorts.\n\ns_01146: (2012) compared the satellite-derived TCHP with 1,294 collocated in situ estimations over the north Indian Ocean and reported a RMSE (root mean square error) of 16.6 kJ cm -2 with a correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.76.\n\ns_01196: The primary analyses were conducted using a mixed effects linear model (random coefficients model) [22] , which adjusts for missing data in testing for differences in the intercepts (baseline scores) and slopes (rate of change) of the ADAS-Cog between groups defined by MMSE categories.\n\ns_01246: Approach of the study\nThe approach followed in this study is to conduct a systematic review of the trends identified internationally by academics and international organisations.\n\ns_01296: Second, we analyzed abstracts for all studies identified and excluded papers that did not satisfy selection criteria.\n\ns_01346: The application of multivariate data-driven approaches, such as machine learning 30, 31 allows inferences to be made at the individual level, and therefore carry greater translational potential for application in clinical practice.\n\ns_01396: Optimal interpolation has generally been used to fill the missing data the, but this needs a priori information about the dataset, such as a decorrelation scale and signal-to-noise ratio.\n\ns_01446: Better tracking of gender differences in such funding would require that all agencies awarding significant grant funding do the following: o Maintain a data system that stores information on all grant applications and investigators, including co-investigators.\n\ns_01496: Both values were derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) archive at the county level.\n\ns_01546: Shimizu et al., 1996; Zyserman and Johnson, 2002 , Tuan et al., 2008 , Kuiry et al., 2010 .\n\ns_01596: Processed reads were aligned against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank NC_045512.2) using BWA-MEM (24).\n\ns_01646: One of the first uses of the proposed database could be to investigate inter-expert variability, and possibly standardize manual outlining methods in order to improve the validation of automated methods for quantifying lesion volume change and atrophy rates in MS.\n\ns_01696: There is a potential for absent or incorrect reporting in retrospective data, variations in coding practices over time, migration of patients in and out of SEER registry areas, and varied reports on the representativeness of the database itself (ie, not all hospitals participate, and those that do are more likely to be large academic centers [42] [43] [44] ).\n\ns_01746: We first simulate data from a multivariate normal distribution with correlation \u03c1 similarly as in previous settings, and then transform each covariate X j in Source 1 to sign(X j ).\n\ns_01796: Some future research directions can be drawn from this study.\n\ns_01846: Each of the steps in the creation of this data set is discussed in the following sections.\n\ns_01896: Sampled areas are detailed in Table  EA2 ; all areas are fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin for one set of blocks, and 70% ethanol with 150 mmol NaCl for another set of blocks.\n\ns_01946: Table 3 displays summary statistics regarding the housing conditions and composition of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study respondents (N = 1989).\n\ns_01996: The findings are presented in terms of English, mathematics and overall attainment.\n\ns_02046: 1,2 These platforms facilitate rapid information sharing, allowing scientists around the world to keep tracing the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which is now known as SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_02096: Data from this study was considered high quality, given its geographic representativeness, complete information on histology and anatomical subsite, versus the limited data from the three IARC-affiliated hospital-based registries [5] .\n\ns_02146: Dimensions database was used to extract a bibliographic mapping file for the papers."
