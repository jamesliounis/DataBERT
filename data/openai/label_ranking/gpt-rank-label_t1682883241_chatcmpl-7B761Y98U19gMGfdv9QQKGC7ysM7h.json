The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09950: The specific section of interest is cited below:\n\ns_00002: The data are available by searching in NDAR and by using the LinkOut feature in PubMed.\n\ns_00052: The data set used in this study was created by merging records of individualized data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Pre-Medical College Admission Test Questionnaire (PMQ) and the Student Record System (SRS).\n\ns_00102: This study set out to use recent, nationally representative data to identify ways in which having a teenage father matters for children.\n\ns_00152: In this paper, we present a method that combines the fast runtimes of learning-based methods with insights derived from classical methods for sparse data, to achieve both high performance and state-of-the-art accuracy.\n\ns_00202: The data analyzed belongs to the period January 1 st -September 30 th and was extracted on October 31 st to minimize missing information due to delays in the data registration.\n\ns_00249: The demographic and clinical variables of the 302 patients who took part in the study are shown in table 1 .\n\ns_00299: The main characteristics of these studies are all summarized in Table 2 .\n\ns_00349: (2013) , and Lichtenberg et al.\n\ns_00399: This result accords with several previously reported studies [16, 18, 21] .\n\ns_00449: For an overview of DCMs, the reader is referred to DiBello, Roussos, and Stout (2007) , Fu and Li (2007) , Rupp and Templin (2008a) , and Rupp et al.\n\ns_00499: Climate data from 1971-2011 were used to construct the baseline species distribution models.\n\ns_00549: What has generally been proved most effective is a combination of approaches to the support of research and development DISCUSSION PAPER that involves diverse strategies.\n\ns_00599: The group used public transcriptomic datasets to evaluate the risk of endometrial SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\ns_00641: [2012a] on the basis of a global analysis.\n\ns_00691: While these indexes were chosen to account and Adams et al.\n\ns_00741: Similarly, data from the TIMSS study has confirmed racial achievement gaps in science at both fourth and eighth grade while results from PISA demonstrate a small gender gap at age 15 (Lee & Buxton, 2010).\n\ns_00791: Tesch\"s method (1990) was employed to analyse the data.\n\ns_00841: Wallace and others (2016) examined the effect of minimum and maximum daily temperature, total daily precipitation, and number of June days with severe storm events on daily nest survival rate and fledgling productivity.\n\ns_00891: The characteristics of the cohorts included in this study are summarized in table 1.\n\ns_00941: Using the CCMP dataset to study climatic trends at global and regional scale (Zheng et al., 2016) , at least in the Mediterranean area, is therefore questionable.\n\ns_00991: The input data for the test case can be found in Table 1 .\n\ns_01041: This study uses data from two national surveys: the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS).\n\ns_01091: We build on the work of Ansari and colleagues (2016) and examine these associations in the Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 data set, a nationally representative sample of Head Start children and classrooms.\n\ns_01141: 2009;Emanuel 1986Emanuel , 1999Black et al."
