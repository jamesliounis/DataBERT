The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04316: In order to determine whether the estimated coefficients represent a causal relationship between and , a Granger causality test is applied.\n\ns_04366: The first two columns present the 'naive' OLS results and the third and fourth column presents the IV estimates.\n\ns_04416: In this paper, we limit our analysis to trade patterns and refrain from drawing welfare implications.\n\ns_04466: The pvalue for testing equality of these effects is 0.127, so we cannot reject that there is no impact of information treatment on the decisions made.\n\ns_04516: The interpretation of the patterns in Table 7 would therefore appear to be that firms in less competitive environments are under less pressure to cut wages, and therefore attach less weight to the potential barriers or concerns that such a course might encounter.\n\ns_04566: To this must be added another worrying aspect of the empirical approach.\n\ns_04616: Following AG (2012), I(:) is a transition function for each country that ranges between 0 (largest expansion) and 1 (deepest recession).\n\ns_04666: Where k denotes a circumstance group (group of children with a specific set of circumstances); is the specific coverage rate of group k; is the share of group k in total population of children; and is the numbers of groups defined by circumstances.\n\ns_04716: We aim to fill these gaps in this paper.\n\ns_04766: Robust standard errors in brackets are clustered by state.\n\ns_04816: The maximized value of the likelihood function obtained using the SES data was -8,233.92 whereas the Townsend-Thai dataset yielded a value of -616.92.\n\ns_04866: Thus in table 4 columns 3 to 4 we substitute the share of social and public goods with a more detailed component of the spending variable.\n\ns_04916: The elasticity is estimated at 0.14, which is broadly consistent with the existing literature (e.g., 0.18 for French firms in Europe (Procher, 2011) ; 0.37 for Korean manufactures in the U.S. (Lee et al., 2012) ; 0.05 for firms in New Zealand (Mare and Graham, 2013) ).\n\ns_04966: Using OLS with fixed effects, we ran both the basic model described by equation 5 and an extended model that included density and urbanization on all 5 infrastructure variables.\n\ns_05016: Column (2) of Table 2 shows that countries with higher participation in GVCs present a lower exchange rate elasticity of manufacturing exports both in the first panel for annual data and the second panel with the five-year averages.\n\ns_05066: The last row in each table corresponds to estimations with the sub-sample of firms that were exporters in 2006.\n\ns_05116: The Shapley decompositions (Table 5) show the relative contributions of different circumstances (wealth, mother's education, father's education, region, urban versus rural, and gender) to this inequality, as a percentage.\n\ns_05166: The focus of the previous section was to obtain growth rate consistent with a set of assumptions on growth drivers.\n\ns_05216: 9 These take-up rates of health insurance are comparable to the existing literature.\n\ns_05266: Ultimately, this paper boils down to a call for a more systematic approach to WSS diagnostics which would minimize the current bias favoring standardized approaches to regulation.\n\ns_05316: II) Productivity adjusted per student formula: maximizes enrollment impact by giving more to states with high enrollment elasticity to subsidy; no equity assurance but at this stage of Mexico's development, it can be favorable to disadvantaged states since they now tend to have higher enrollment elasticities.\n\ns_05366: Interestingly, regional effects seem to be stronger than those from countries6 For example,Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000a) andKaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2000) have pointed to the role of financial links and have focused on the behavior of international banks and mutual funds.Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini (2000) in contrast have focused on the role of trade links.\n\ns_05416: 3 These approaches estimate a welfare model on the baseline survey using a small number of easy-to-collect indicators.\n\ns_05466: This result, in alignment with Feyrer (2009) which shows similar findings for trade, can be explained by the endogenous selection of goods into the different transportation mode and the increasing usage of air and railway transportation with the technological improvement in air and rail transportation and the proliferation of GVCs.\n\ns_05516: Where relevant data are available, topics are analyzed through the lens of government performance, rather than through the citizen's perspective and experience of the process."
