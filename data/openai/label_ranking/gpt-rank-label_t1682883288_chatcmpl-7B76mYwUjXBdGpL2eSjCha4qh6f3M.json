The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08651: See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of the findings.\n\ns_08701: The program reads observational data and forecast system output, fills in missing data, creates new data structures for comparison purposes, carries out the comparisons, and presents the results in tabular form.\n\ns_08751: www.cts-journal.com Table 2 Unadjusted associations between past participation, past opportunity, and willingness to participate and sociodemographic characteristics, access to care, and health status   Data Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015.\n\ns_08801: First the datasets were converted to the BIDS format, then the t1-volume preprocessing pipeline of Clinica was applied [10] .\n\ns_08851: The transcripts of these interviews were coded using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) , allowing for both inductive (i.e., unanticipated themes emerging from the data) and deductive coding.\n\ns_08901: To illustrate this point, I will give some data from a brief empirical example.\n\ns_08951: [8] We derive a data set of breakup times and modes by analyzing ground-based observations recorded by a web camera, a coastal radar and ice observers as well as satelliteremote sensing data to arrive at a better understanding of the landfast ice breakup process at Barrow and examine its variability on the time scale of a decade.\n\ns_09001: These existing data were derived from the Data.\n\ns_09051: The HURSAT-microwave consists of data from the SSM/I platforms between 1987 and 2009, using global best track data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) to search for TCs [24] .\n\ns_09101: The presented framework has broad applicability to data analysis studies involving heterogeneous data sources, both in terms of modalities and dimensions.\n\ns_09151: Details about the creation of each variable appear in the variable descriptions contained in the Tables and figures throughout this report present relevant analyses from the fullscale collection.\n\ns_09201: The mean and range of the estimates are reported in Tables 1 through 3, by crop, state or country (hereinafter, both referred to as state), and event (or transformation type).\n\ns_09251: To preliminarily explore age-related differences in activity patterns, the sample was divided into four data-driven (equally sized) age strata: <60 years old (group 1, 142 participants), 60-67 years old (group 2, 147 participants), 68-74 years old (group 3, 157 participants), and \u226575 years old (group 4, 165 participants).\n\ns_09301: In our experiments, we used brain MRI data from the ADNI database [4] .\n\ns_09351: In addition, the reference space itself is iteratively optimized from the GM and WM probability maps of different subjects using the DARTEL algorithm (Ashburner, 2007) .\n\ns_09401: All statistical analyses were performed using SAS package, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and significance was set at p\u2264 0.05.\n\ns_09451: This study protocol was approved by the Kayseri Training and Research Hospital ethics committee (2020-3-/23), which allowed sampling for diagnostic and surveillance purposes.\n\ns_09501: Similar, technique was employed by Indian scientists who have developed FELUDA, a test kit for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection also employs CRISPR-Cas9 system [108] .\n\ns_09551: This technique first estimates the number of studies that may be missing as a result of publication bias, with publication bias meaning studies with effect sizes that are low or near zero relative to the average effect.\n\ns_09601: Most relevant to the current study, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that time spent on homework has a positive impact on boys' high school grade point averages (GPAs), which are a measure of both cognitive and non-cognitive ability.\n\ns_09651: The empirical results, in a total of six comparisons, demonstrated that the spherical sparse coding method achieved greater statistical power than some other standard features.\n\ns_09701: The baccalaureate degree concentrationswhich were coded into three broad categories of physical science/engineering, life science, and nonscience-resulted in a categorical dependent variable (tables S1 and S2 and supporting online material text) (5) .\n\ns_09751: This multisite open-source data set was designed to accelerate the discovery of biomarkers and to identify and track AD pathology.\n\ns_09801: In each phase of the research, a set of problems was assigned to the study participants and the frequencies and percentages of their responses to the posed problems were calculated.\n\ns_09851: As such, the ability to produce joint forecasts -such as those depicted in Figure 1
