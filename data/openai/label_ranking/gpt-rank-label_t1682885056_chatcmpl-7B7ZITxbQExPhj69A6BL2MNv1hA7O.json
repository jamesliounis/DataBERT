The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07456: The analysis is carried out using a mean comparison and on an incremental basis (using correlations).\n\ns_07506: The observed spread of 1.273% per year may be compared to that reported by Friedman and Warshawsky (1990) for the US.\n\ns_07556: El-Badawi, et al..' found that the estimated marginal effect of adjustme;.\n\ns_07606: 86, 493-500] V. CONCLUSIONS This survey reveals considerable evidence pointing to the existence of upward bias in measures of China's real industrial output during the past decade.\n\ns_07656: The menu approach implicitly reflected the longer-term framework that the debt crisis required, and was intended to provide countries with both time and debt relief, including, in some cases a negotiated and market-based reduction of debt obligations.\n\ns_07706: where po is the value of p in col. 1.\n\ns_07756: Huq (1989);Killick (1978);Rimmer (1989), and World Bank, Country Economic Memorandum (various years).\n\ns_07806: The second plots provided information about possible nonlinear relationships in the residuals.\n\ns_07856: Financial indicators have been monitored over the past two years in the eight project towns, the results of which are described in Section 4.A.\n\ns_07906: In Section II, details regarding the tax law for five countries that use tax holiday incentives are surveyed.\n\ns_07956: For more information on the tanker truck drivers union, see Appendix, \"Financial Aspects of the Water Vending Business for Different Types of Water Vendors,\" pp.\n\ns_08006: by number of deposits by volume of deposits deposits low er than 100,000 deposits higher than 100,000\n\ns_08056: In this paper we refer to both types of transfer, whether from the government or from other consumers, as a subsidy.\n\ns_08106: Construction of such projections raises significant technical and, even more crucially, incentive-compatibility problems (see Irwin 2005 ).\n\ns_08156: Goldsmith also gives the area as 3.3 million km 2 , while Taagepera (1979: Table 2, p. 125) gives 3.4 million km 2 (for year 1, wrongly labeled as year 0).\n\ns_08206: This result largely stems from the fact that these students foresee that their chances of completion are low and choose not to enroll in college even when it's available.\n\ns_08283: 10 During the course of its use, the NPSAS has become a functional way to identify student subpopulations and therefore has served as a base of recruitment and establishment of baseline measures for other nationally administered longitudinal surveys including the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B).\n\ns_08333: The format of their dataset does not allow us to directly merge their dataset with another one, as they textually report the measures implemented or discussed.\n\ns_08383: In the Australian dataset APOE genotype was estimated from imputed rs429358 and rs7412 SNP genotypes (Supplementary methods).\n\ns_08433: The identification of the voxels as core points, border points and noise is similar to the original DBSCAN.\n\ns_08483: Only this type of morbidity data will provide the evidence base for continued use of the therapy.\n\ns_08533: We selected three of them that are based on the existing literature.\n\ns_08583: identified the analytes alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2Macro), eotaxin 3 (Eotaxin 3) and pancreatic polypeptide (PPP) to be over expressed in the serum of AD participants relative to controls [11] similar to the current findings.\n\ns_08633: Dr. Gordon receives royalties from Cambridge University Press and UptoDate for work unrelated to this topic.\n\ns_08683: TIMSS-2003 used this approach to generate the overall science and mathematics scores and the scale scores for the two subjects."
