The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01167: 2011;Lin 2012), it is also key to understand the air-sea interaction during the passage of a cyclone, not only in terms of the sea surface temperature, but also of the upper-ocean thermal structure (UOTS).\n\ns_01217: Trials with duration less than 24 months would still be used in the estimation of the slope parameter by contributing data at the time points where observations were collected.\n\ns_01267: The G20 will need to consider the current data limitations and construct an index in line with the suggested digital literacy framework.\n\ns_01317: For example, one study of young adults from Zurich showed that the course of diagnostically defined atypical depression was associated with an earlier age of onset and greater chronicity [38] .\n\ns_01367: In the PSYSCAN study, although all sites are using scanners with the same field strength and harmonized acquisition parameters (supplementary materials 2), additional variability can still arise through the use of scanners that differ in model, manufacturer or specific features.\n\ns_01417: This distribution of the high cores implies that the first EOF mode may explain SSTA variability of the central JES, including SPF.\n\ns_01467: This is similar to women's representation in the population of doctoral recipients working in science and engineering.\n\ns_01517: Figure 3a depicts the NP statistics averaged for 1979 to 2005 over the Southwest, Mid-South, and Southeast regions in terms of varying N 0 from 110 to 440 kg ha -1 (in increments of 27.5 kg ha -1 ) for \u03b1 values of 0.05, 0.50, and 1.00.\n\ns_01567: Finally, the accuracy of the model to simulate the morphological changes is investigated by comparing the bed changes in all the measurement stations in the estuary.\n\ns_01617: In case of a public health emergency or when scientific research in public health is required, the national law 9/1979, decrees 786/1990 and 2323/2006, authorizes the INS to use the biological material and associated epidemiological information without informed consent, including the anonymous disclosure of results.\n\ns_01667: A recent review of the literature on correlative studies between MRI and histopathology in MS [10] recommended improvement of imaging specificity, highresolution image acquisition, and use of combination of imaging methods in longitudinal studies to gain a deeper understanding of the disease processes in MS.\nAgainst this background, this paper focuses on what we consider desirable future developments in image acquisition and analysis for the longitudinal assessment of brain lesions and brain atrophy in MS.\n\ns_01717: There are limitations in this study design.\n\ns_01767: However, Groups 3 and 4, also containing values from Source 3, can provide additional information in imputing missing variables X m(r) through correlations with other covariates.\n\ns_01817: A recent study by Thayn and Simanis [52] suggested that the spatial filtering approach effectively minimizes spatial misspecification errors, improves model fit, and eliminates spatial dependence.\n\ns_01867: First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention.\n\ns_01917: This feature prevents mismatched data in two different databases and provides the genetics group access to the most upto-date clinical and neuropathological diagnoses, because these may change over time with new ND research advances.\n\ns_01967: Future research should strive to collect data allowing crossnation comparisons within the UK.\n\ns_02017: The information on national tests and examinations in English and mathematics was provided by data managers in each school.\n\ns_02067: 61 The results of thermal inactivation or lysis of NP swab samples with an increasing number of amplification cycles were also consistent with the standard detection methods.\n\ns_02117: Two centers in our sample (Nicaragua and Panama) had already recorded age in groups subsets (15-44, 45-54, etc.)\n\ns_02167: Table 2 points to some interesting aspects of research activity in this area.\n\ns_02217: Whether dual decline identifies a particular subtype or multiple subtypes of dementia remains to be investigated.\n\ns_02250: Although the association was not significant in the restricted group (ie, model 4), it was found to be larger and significant (0.036; 95% CI, 0.006-0.066) after the exclusion of an individual with comparatively low CSF-A\u03b2 (<50 pg/mL), low temporoparietal metabolism (<0.80), and high WMHs (1.3% of total brain volume).\n\ns_02300: For the c. 1870s digital elevation model, we used a combination of several high-resolution Hsheet and T-sheet manuscript maps to construct a high resolution DEM.\n\ns_02350: Regional GM volumes were used to account for the potential effects of regional atrophy in FDG analyses, because expanding sulci in MCI and AD brains may lead to underestimation of FDG values (26) ."
