The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06563: Second, they help us understand the responses of TPOs during the pandemic and how differences in budget can help explain how TPOs adapted.\n\ns_06613: Inasmuch as a fiscal adjustment would in practice involve a combination of tax increases and expenditure reductions, the resulting implications for the macroeconomic aggregates may be worked out by inspecting columns (1) and (2) in Table 3 .1.\n\ns_06663: data collection, all administrative support and human resource functions bought from the Bank of Finalsn, the Finnish FSA has also been able to achieve significant scale economies.\n\ns_06713: An important issue that needs to be mentioned here is the measurement of public sector deficits.\n\ns_06763: A large proportion of extremely-poor households, measured by initial landholding size, join microcredit programs (Husain 1998 , Zaman 1998 , Khandker 2003 .\n\ns_06813: First, we used the lobbying country exports to the world as weights to distribute across sectors.\n\ns_06863: To a large extent, the context is shaped by factors external (or outside the control) of households.\n\ns_06913: 2 As this paper will show, the contribution of demographic changes to aggregate poverty measures is non-parametrically identified.\n\ns_06963: In light of the above, our empirical specification is given by:\n\ns_07013: While we can not offer conclusive evidence on why migrants may move out of slums at a higher rate, the survey information shows that migrants in the sample have higher educational attainment compared to natives, and most have moved to Bhopal in search of employment opportunities.\n\ns_07063: In turn, the National Economic Census of 1994 shows a total of 27,177 people employed by this industry 12 , whereas the 1985 census showed a total employment of 31,596\n\ns_07113: The change in government transfer payments was statistically significant in the 2SLS and the cutoff=0.5 specifications, with coefficients of about 0.3 and 0.2 respectively.\n\ns_07163: However, these results can also occur due to another well documented finding in recent studies that report that the level of a country's stock market development (e.g.\n\ns_07213: 17 Finally, we regressed baseline outcomes (enrollment or child work) on the extended set of controls, canton fixed effects, and a dummy variable for conditioned households:\n\ns_07263: The transition economies on which this paper focuses are a very heterogeneous group of countries.\n\ns_07313: See Heckman and Hotz (1989) andHeckman and Robb (1985) for the methods to deal with endogenous policy interventions.\n\ns_07363: Building on this foundation, a key initiative was the creation of a semi-public agency (TTN) in February 2000 to create and operate a value-added network that would provide electronic data interchange (EDI) for stakeholders and to expedite flows and processing of trade documents.\n\ns_07413: The findings underlined in the previous part are uncovered here.\n\ns_07463: This possibility is analyzed further in Tables 9 and 10.\n\ns_07513: It also presents empirical evidence on the administrative charges in the Chilean mandatory pension system, the charges and costs of private and public pension systems in the United States, and the state-rmn pensions in Malaysia and Zambia.\n\ns_07563: This conclusion is shared by the critics of structural adjustment such as Stewart, et al 25 who state that \"while industrial output grew at a rate comparable to that of other areas in the world before the 1980s, the pattern of industrialization vas, for the most part, inefficient by every measure, highly protected, highly import-dependent, with very few linkages with the rest of the economy and associated with very low levels of export\".\n\ns_07613: There is a major inconsistency in data for the electric power industry, in which data for the state sector alone indicate much larger energy consumption in both 1980 and 1985 than for the entire power branch!\n\ns_07663: This tern refers to the phenomenon whereby some banks refuse to choose any of the exchange instruments offered to them, but continue to hold out for their original claims to be serviced.\n\ns_07713: 2[y, (p' -c' -a't,)-'-(1-AX) x -Po* Ro = 0\n\ns_07763: Given the severe lags in accounting and general instability in the Ghanaian economy during the period that we cover (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) , it is quite likely that there is a fair amount of \"noise\" in the data used, which may affect our regression results."
