The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00339: All these studies differ each other for several aspects, including the main aim of the study (that not always is specifically addressed to the study of sex hormones decline during aging), the involvement of subjects of both genders, the duration of the study, and the number of participants ( Table 2 ).\n\ns_00389: 1 based on the technology development curve created by King (1992) .\n\ns_00439: In the LNC cohort, larger test-retest variability was observed when core white matter was used as reference region in comparison to cerebellar cortex referencing.\n\ns_00489: A number of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), also known as diagnostic classification models (DCMs), have been developed (Rupp, Templin, & Henson, 2010) to apply the CDA approach.\n\ns_00539: Second, we separated out six years of data covering a drought period from 1987 through 1992 [21] .\n\ns_00589: Much, however, has been learned from prior science initiatives.\n\ns_00639: Overall, all genes showed increased expression during the early secretory to mid-secretory phase.\n\ns_00681: Applying a downscaling approach Emanuel [2006] has shown, that a 10% increase in thermocline depth results in 4% more intense TCs.\n\ns_00731: For instance, an infinite number of posrelative position of the samples to each other and sible temporal distributions could produce the the site or area being estimated\" (Lefohn et al.\n\ns_00781: In addition to the primary model, we also sought to understand the factors that explain the gaps.\n\ns_00831: Reflection and review by the academics took place after each session, in order to decide on the themes for the following session.\n\ns_00881: In another Utah study, Woffinden (1975) determined that the average slope for hills on which 19 outcrop nests were placed was 43\u00b0, whereas the average slope of hills for the 16 trees harboring nests was 27\u00b0.\n\ns_00931: We have evaluated the proposed method based on a large cohort of subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including ADNI 1, ADNI GO, and ADNI 2.\n\ns_00981: VAM combines RSS instrument data with moored buoy measurements and a starting estimate of the wind field, provided by the ERA-Interim reanalysis winds.\n\ns_01031: Whereas PMP is meant to quickly determine the integral values of the propellant management system, EUCES simulates the processes on a more detailed level.\n\ns_01081: However, when the means of more than two groups are to be compared to each other, multiple comparison tests need to be used.\n\ns_01131: The only other study we are aware of that examined interactions between classroom quality and age composition found that high scores on behavior management were associated with greater gains in children's vocabulary skills when children were in mixedage classrooms (Guo et al., 2014) .\n\ns_01181: The intensification of TCs is caused by the interaction of many complex mechanisms that include TC dynamics, upper-ocean interaction and atmospheric circulation (Gray 1979;Holliday and Thompson 1979;Merrill 1988;Emanuel 1999;Emanuel et al.\n\ns_01231: Any potential benefits of neuropsychological testing to enrich clinical trials samples must be balanced against the increased time and participant burden required in a screening process that includes such measures.\n\ns_01281: On the positive side, the sampling strategy aims to be representative and includes paper-based options for the non-digitally inclined respondents (see Figure 2 ).\n\ns_01331: As with symptom syndromes, whether environmental factors are the cause of a particular trajectory, or whether individuals with a genetic predisposition to a particular trajectory are more susceptible to specific environmental factors, can only be answered by extended longitudinal studies and the assessment of interaction between genetic and environmental factors [70, 71] Finally, an alternative way of viewing these patterns was proposed by twin studies and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which both support a trait-state model of depression, where symptom levels can be accounted for by two factors: a level (average or \"trait\") effect that is highly heritable and reflects underlying vulnerability and a residual (\"state\") effect that is non-inheritable and reflects occasion specific circumstances [49, 71] .\n\ns_01381: 32, 33 In addition, multivariate approaches consider multiple voxels simultaneously and between-voxel correlations, rather than each voxel independently, and might therefore be better suited to detecting abnormalities at a network level, rather than focally.\n\ns_01431: We now call them the background anomaly data (SLPA, SATA, and SSTA).\n\ns_01481: The major exception was at NIH, where female applicants in 2001-2003 received on average only 63 percent of the funding that male applicants received.\n\ns_01531: Inclusion of the above improvements and optimizations in the redeveloped GOSSYM produced good agreement with observations, where simulated 1979 to 2005 mean yields were within \u00b110% of observed values across almost the entire U.S. Cotton Belt."
