The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08504: We have presented a new dataset on population by age, sex, and level of educational attainment for the period 1970 to 2060 (and extended to 2100) for 171 countries.\n\ns_08554: Table 2 Cross validation results (%): mean\u00b1SD is shown for accuracy and AUROC\n\ns_08604: As Table 2 shows, the mean number of 30-patientwaivered physicians per capita is much higher than the number of 100patient-waivered physicians per capita, buprenorphine-providing opioid treatment programs per capita, and buprenorphine-providing substance abuse treatment facilities per capita.\n\ns_08654: See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of the frameworks.\n\ns_08704: Dingman & Bedford 30 used statistical tests of significance (mean error, variance, skewness) to assess skill, but introduced non-dimensional skill scores (eg, 1 -mean error/mean value) as a way of determining whether deviations between model and data are real or whether they are simply related to the noise.\n\ns_08754: The study adds key insights into the factors associated with research participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate.\n\ns_08804: These analyses are performed to assess the stability of the visualization method and provide a baseline value by using the inter-subject similarity for the different metrics.\n\ns_08854: The data is used here for descriptive, contextual purposes only (see Keating and Melis, 2017 for further analysis).\n\ns_08904: Rosenzweig examined these z-values and noticed that in fact z-values were strongly correlated with the temporal scale of the processes involved in creating the SPAR.\n\ns_08954: Here, we took an approach employed in numerical sea ice models and advanced statistical models of glacier ablation by integrating measures of irradiance [Hock, 1999].\n\ns_09004: A limitation of this study is that data used in these analyses were collected across different years, ranging from 2010 to 2017.\n\ns_09054: The microwave data interpolated onto an 8-km grid in the hurricane satellite (HURSAT) archive was created in 2008 [65] .\n\ns_09104: We adopt a well known methodology for regression called Partial Least Squares (PLS) [9] [10].\n\ns_09154: This information included details about the study sponsor, how the data would be used, answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), confidentiality assurances, and selected findings from BPS:12/14.\n\ns_09204: They collected farm-level data on the net benefits of the Bt varieties and, using the same basic modeling approach as Moschini, Lapan, and Sobolevsky (1999) and Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson (2000), estimated the distribution of benefits among farmers, seed companies, and research institutes/companies.\n\ns_09254: A general description of the sample and enrollment procedures and criteria has been previously reported (9) .\n\ns_09304: We combined the correlation parameters together with a few other deformation parameters into a seven-dimensional vector, and applied three vector-classification methods to investigate if such vectors could yield distinguish between AD and NL subjects in agreement with the ground truth data for 31 subjects from the ADNI database.\n\ns_09354: The previous study of Abdulkadir et al.\n\ns_09404: Overall characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 .\n\ns_09454: According to published case reports and GISAID metadata entries, at least 9 SARS-CoV-2 samples in the nearby clusters had a recent travel history to Iran [30] .\n\ns_09504: Single-cell RNA sequencing data of 43,134 human lung cells reported that only 0.64% of total cells expressed ACE2 and out of which 83% of total ACE2 expression was present on type II apical surface of epithelial cells (AT2) [41] .\n\ns_09554: 2 Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the relevant variables in the unaggregated database.\n\ns_09604: Similarly, table\nA.5 reports estimates of a variety of models that address the limited nature of the to-coded, count nature of the ELS homework variable: Type 1 Tobit, two-limit tobit, Poisson regression, rightcensored Poisson regression, and interval regression (Raciborski, 2011; Wooldridge, 2013) .\n\ns_09654: The main contributions of this work are as follows.\n\ns_09704: Our analysis began with a baseline model that included only the Career Expectation independent variable and continued with successively more complex models systematically accounting for each of the four covariate groups (see table on  page 1143 and table S7) ."
