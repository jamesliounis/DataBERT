The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07864: PMO would prepare standard reporting formats and make them available to MOW, the project towns, Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, NUWA, and the UWSDs to facilitate their timely and efficient reporting.\n\ns_07914: These assumptions regarding financial policy may be used to derive a value maximization problem for the firm.\n\ns_07964: In order to turn the failure of the previous survey into an advantage, the enumeration team was challenged to show that they could do good work and a sense of \"ownership\" in the study was instilled in the enumerators.\n\ns_08014: On the one hand, selecting a subset of institutions to include under the new insurance system would have a strong signaling effect.\n\ns_08064: Clearly, all households are subsidy recipients in Scenario 1 when everybody is charged a tariff below the cost-recovery level (Table 7) .\n\ns_08114: While far from unanimous, a majority of studies -especially those using physical asset stocks to measure infrastructure -find significantly positive effects of public capital on aggregate output and its growth rate, although the findings are less robust among those studies that use public investment flows (or their cumulative value) as regressors.\n\ns_08164: The estimated Gini of between 37 and 40 might seem low in the light of the excesses of wealth in Rome (see Table below with data gathered from Tacitus's Annals) But this extraordinary wealth was limited to a very few people at the very top.\n\ns_08214: The students in the model then must make choices about whether to enroll in college, how to finance it if they do enroll, 6 how much they want to consume, how much time they want to allocate to learning, and what assets to invest in.\n\ns_08291: The NSCG tracks a wide range of demographic information (e.g., age, race, citizenship status, disability status), professional and educational information (e.g., employment status, job satisfaction, salary, school enrollment status), and personal information (e.g., marital status, number of children, educationrelated loan debt) on students who have graduated from college with at least a bachelor's degree.\n\ns_08341: with a decreasing trend at some date or values higher than 0 before any COVID-19 cases was reported -the principal investigator checked that the coding of the measures was accurate and particularly that, at date t-1 before the implementation of a given measure, the coding was 0, and that, at date t + 1, the coding was 1.\n\ns_08391: Apart from the lack of suitable and adequately powered prospective studies, a limitation of observational studies is the inability to distinguish between causal associations and those due to confounding and reverse causation.\n\ns_08441: We want to construct a feature space F with M A + M B samples and dimension K A + K B , in the following way\nwith r, s \u2208 {population A, population B}.\n\ns_08491: For example, presenilin-linked AD is associated with altered Ab42 production (Selkoe, 2001) , while APOE 34 is associated with decreased clearance of Ab from the brain (Holtzman et al., 2000) .\n\ns_08541: In the third section, we compare the results of the back-projections with the other existing datasets as mentioned above.\n\ns_08591: 1(d-f) compare selected features in di3erent classification tasks using EN50.\n\ns_08641: The amount of buprenorphine dispensed and the number of buprenorphine providers of all types rose substantially between 2004 and 2011, consistent with a range of studies finding an increase in buprenorphine-waivered providers, substance abuse treatment facilities using buprenorphine, and patients receiving buprenorphine.\n\ns_08691: In the studies, these broad explanatory factors underlying student achievement are classified under curriculum (Robitaille and Garden, 1996).\n\ns_08741: To the extent possible, their approach has been followed by the authors.\n\ns_08791: This article used three questions added to the Arkansas BRFSS to examine the relationship between key demographic and health status factors and health research participation, opportunities to participate in health research, and willingness to participate in health research.\n\ns_08841: To observe this similarity, we reused the same masks as those produced for the grid search (see Figure 3 and 4) .\n\ns_08891: Our findings suggest that young people's views of the future were shaped by their deep-seated faith in the transformative power of hard work.\n\ns_08941: There are also deep CLT-like statistical reasons for why we might find a power distribution ( Simon 1955 , Mandelbrot 1963 , Bak et al.\n\ns_08991: [52] This work highlights the importance of grounded pressure ridges for the stability of landfast sea ice in the Alaska Arctic, and the significant interannual variability of breakup dates observed during the past decade.\n\ns_09041: Figure 3 shows the Moran's I values for the residuals from Model 1, which excludes the organizational environment variable.\n\ns_09091: Results show that PHRaM is improved significantly compared with the standard R-CLIPER."
