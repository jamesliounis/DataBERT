The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01461: However, several important data limitations inspire caution in reaching conclusions based on these NIH results.\n\ns_01511: Th e result shows that the redeveloped GOSSYM realistically reproduces the geographic distribution of mean cotton yields in 30-km grids, within \u00b110% of observations across most of the U.S. Cotton Belt, whereas the original GOSSYM overestimated yields by 27 to 135% at the state level and 92% overall.\n\ns_01561: By selecting several representative locations in the estuary, the highest water stages were extracted from the time histories of the computed water elevations.\n\ns_01611: This study has some limitations.\n\ns_01661: These points should prove complementary: the standard test dataset may facilitate development and improvement of the integrated segmentation techniques, which in turn would benefit from the isotropic spatial resolution of the acquisition.\n\ns_01711: Our findings support the previously reported high mortality associated with mcGTCs, 11, 18 with a 5-year DSS of 62.8%.\n\ns_01761: The proposed method improves variable selection accuracy through incorporating more information about missing covariates from incomplete case groups.\n\ns_01811: Based on the Compressed Mortality Files maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics [53] , we created the 2004-2008 five-year average mortality rates that are standardized to the 2006 US age-sex population structure.\n\ns_01861: The complex standard errors (in columns 11 and 12) were calculated using the computer program SUDAAN, which takes into account the complex nature of the sampling design of NELS:88/94.\n\ns_01911: Another example of translational research is the discovery by Cohen and colleagues [49] of how tau acetylation impairs tau-microtubule interactions and promotes pathological tau aggregation, and the following study by Irwin and colleagues [41] that characterized the deposits in AD and cases of FTLD resulting from tau immunoreactive deposits.\n\ns_01961: Furthermore, details of the measures utilised in the baseline survey and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are presented.\n\ns_02011: The standardized beta weights were .522 for KS2 English score (p < .0001) and .225 for how long the students had been playing .225 (p < .01) (see Table 3 for details).\n\ns_02061: Alternatively, Wang et al.\n\ns_02111: This distribution among US Hispanics is similar to the US overall distribution reported since 1977 (37.7 %, n= 9707/25,752) [19] .\n\ns_02161: Two software's Pajek and VOSviewer were used for co-citation analysis.\n\ns_02211: Compared to met carriers, val homozygotes had slower annual whole brain WMH accrual (median (IQR) 31.4% (61.7) vs. 60.7% (92.4)), stronger in women.\n\ns_02244: However, adjustment for these variables (eg, depression) could have led to overadjustment of the models because depression may mediate the effects of WMHs on cognition and potentially brain metabolism.\n\ns_02294: In a separate report, we summarized the scenarios, the flood reduction results, display a few representative scenarios and interpret the physical reasons for changes in flood elevations [Orton and Wu, 2015].\n\ns_02344: Among all participants, the main effects of HOMA-IR were nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but the HOMA-IR 3 baseline diagnosis interactions were significant (Table 2 ).\n\ns_02394: 610 Journal of Geophysical Research, 121, 5847-5871. doi.org/10.1002/2016JC011643.\n\ns_02444: Our findings showed that rurality and PCP specialty were strong predictors of per-patient LVC Medicare spending.\n\ns_02494: We initially evaluated the separability of positive and neutral evolutionary simulations using sitefrequency based summary statistics Tajima's D (TajD) and Fay and Wu's H (FWuH) (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n\ns_02544: These results are particularly compelling when compared with percentages of use and ratings of the information provided by the USDA and state agriculture departments.\n\ns_02594: Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska conceived and designed the experiments; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Marta Grabowska, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska, Marcin S\u0142ojewski performed the experiments; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter analyzed the data; Adriana J\u0119drzychowska, Zuzanna Marcinowska contributed reagents; Marta Grabowska, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska, Marcin S\u0142ojewski contributed materials and analysis tools; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska wrote the paper.\n\ns_02644: The differences in populations, assessment tools, as well as the likely effects of possible confounding factors including age, gender, educational level, as well as other neuroendocrine and psychological factors might explain these discrepancies."
