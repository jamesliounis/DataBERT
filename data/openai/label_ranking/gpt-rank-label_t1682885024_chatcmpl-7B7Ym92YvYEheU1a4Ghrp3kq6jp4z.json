The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08682: TIMSS is a series of studies conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to examine student achievement in science and mathematics, two key curriculum areas that are fundamental to the development of technologically literate societies.\n\ns_08732: To summarise, several classic statistical variables mentioned above, such as RMSE, standard deviation, correct negative fraction and correct positive fraction, and positive predictive value and negative predictive value, are incorporated in the NOS standard skill assessment software.\n\ns_08782: For unadjusted associations, each of the sociodemographic, rurality/urbanity, access to health care, perceived general health, and chronic conditions variables were cross-tabulated with each of the three dependent variables.\n\ns_08832: The hyperparameters explored for the architecture were the number of convolutional blocks, of filters in the first layer and of convolutional layers in a block, the dimension reduction strategy (by using a max pooling layer or by setting the stride of the last convolutional layer of the convolutional block to 2), the number of fully-connected layers and the dropout rate.\n\ns_08882: The participants in our in-depth interviews were recruited in several ways.\n\ns_08932: I generated data from five different underlying functions: power law (S =cA z ), logarithm (S = log(c+zA), two with an asymptote (Michaelis -Menton and Ivlev) and one sigmoidal (logistic).\n\ns_08982: [45] We focused on one particular definition of breakup in section 4 on the basis of a physical process at one reference location in section 5.4.\n\ns_09032: To maintain consistency with the 45-nearest-neighbor threshold used to measure the spatial extent of the influential organizational environment on schools in this study, we used the same 45-nearest-neighbor spatial weights matrix to diagnose the degree of spatial dependence in our regression models.\n\ns_09082: This methodology leverages information in each channel (due to the weighting function representing different altitudes and chemical profiles) to emphasize specific structural features such as overshooting convective tops.\n\ns_09132: Although classifiers utilizing kernel approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) could work in the high-dimensional imaging feature space, for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), dimensionality reduction has to be performed.\n\ns_09182: The discussion also outlines the sampling methods used in the first follow-up data collection, BPS:12/14.\n\ns_09232: Table 3 reports similar results for other transgene types.\n\ns_09282: Although the proportions of men (50.4%) and women over the entire sample were similar, there were significant differences by age group, with more men in the oldest group.\n\ns_09332: After we select two ROIs R and R', we can determine the correlation coefficients given by Eqs.\n\ns_09382: This trend relates to both the widespread availability of brain imaging equipment in clinical routine and research, and the concurrent development of neuroinformatics which has materialized in several free as well as commercial image analysis software packages released over the past 15 years: SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, BrainVisa, Mindboggle, NeuroQuant, and NeuroQLab, to mention a few.\n\ns_09432: We then used a mediation pathway approach 19 and calculate the percentage decrease of odds ratio for BMI after adjusting the model for BMD (see Figure 1 and its legend).\n\ns_09482: We also showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait and that the cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and to share the common unique nucleotide substitutions.\n\ns_09532: New updates poured reticent on deadly virus from all over world are considered in present review to enhance knowledge and clear out concepts for present future prospects of clinico-trials to ascertain success in the possible drugs development for COVID-19 treatment.\n\ns_09582: When a sample provided results across multiple assessment waves, we retained the effect size with the largest sample size.\n\ns_09632: Online appendix table A.3 summarizes the coding scheme, the specific courses assigned to each categorical indicator, and the percentage of the sample enrolled in each course category.\n\ns_09682: In our approach, the spherical parameter surface is the canonical space from which patches are selected.\n\ns_09732: Suppose the first pair has average mathematics achievement scores (average math achievement score at eighth grade = 45, SD = 11).\n\ns_09782: The autoencoder acts as an unsupervised concept extractor for the original data samples.\n\ns_09832: This result is in line with Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.\n\ns_09882: In this paper, we investigate an application of the Disease-Atlas to forecasting longitudinal measurements and expected time-totransition to Dementia for patients at risk of Alzheimer's Disease."
