The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09646: These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the SES gap and the reversal of the gender gap in college completion are at least partly attributable to corresponding SES and gender gaps in non-cognitive skills that originate in childhood and persist into young adulthood (Jacob, 2002; Lundberg, 2013) .\n\ns_09696: To further compare performance, we also plot ROC curves with computed AUC measures, which are shown in Figure 3 .\n\ns_09746: Specifically, we asked whether eighth-grade students (approximately age 13) who reported that they expected to enter a science-related career by age 30 obtained baccalaureate degrees in science-related fields at higher rates than students who did not have this expectation.\n\ns_09796: The input of the SVM is the result of feature coding of the original regions ROIs by the DBN.\n\ns_09846: This may be due to the type of the problem, as it could be solved based on the concepts of proportion and quantities.\n\ns_09896: For instance, volumes of different parts of the brain (e.g.\n\ns_09946: We are also beginning a project that uses comprehensive lists of ethnic surnames to track knowledge flows between co-ethnics.\n\ns_09996: The percent of students that exceed/meet standards is directly related to principal salaries and years of experience and inversely related to the percent of low-income students.\n\ns_00048: However, the ability to define phenotypes (see below) helps researchers search across data elements that are related to each other.\n\ns_00098: Through this study, we found that respondents reporting both HSSLRA and CLRA participation were more than four times more likely to matriculate into an MD/PhD programs than their peers who did not report LRA experiences.\n\ns_00148: It is important to note that the average adolescent father in this data set did not have a high school degree, which is often considered to be a minimum requirement for attractive employment opportunities (Upchurch & McCarthy, 1990) and likely affects the resources teenage fathers can provide.\n\ns_00198: Finally we define the sparse local cross correlation as:\nSLCC computes the local correlation in each neighborhood between voxels that are observed in both scans.\n\ns_00295: For inclusion, subjective and objective evidence (verified by an informant) was required for progressive cognitive impairment over a period of more than 6 months.\n\ns_00345: The methodological approach used for T measurement has changed overtime according to advancements in this field in all the studies (Table 4 ).\n\ns_00395: \u2022 December 2013 23 (6) the Chesapeake Bay region suggests that a 50% adoption rate of WSIN technology would result in %32,000 kg less N and %19,000 kg less P being discharged into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and with a 100% adoption rate %64,000 kg less N and %38,000 kg less P discharged.\n\ns_00445: One study comparing two-component (brain and non-brain) vs. threecomponent (gray matter, white matter, non-brain) reported relative advantages and disadvantages of both methods [20] .\n\ns_00495: Under this condition, item parameter estimates from the DINA model can provide feedback for students from the two countries.\n\ns_00545: The frequency (y-axis) of variable type (x-axis) in top ten variables for waterbird species distribution models, grouped by species sensitivity to climate change.\n\ns_00595: \u2022 Support training of clinicians in the interpretation of genetic data and their clinical utility while increasing the number of genetic counselors being trained.\n\ns_00687: [2014], and can be explained by stronger TCs inducing more cooling.\n\ns_00737: Data from rainfall (Hansen 1991) .\n\ns_00787: We now turn to results from regression models exploring these gaps in more detail.\n\ns_00837: Researchers from both universities were assigned to investigate the LLP.\n\ns_00887: Of 46 eggs collected in North Dakota and South Dakota during a 4-year period in the 1970s, 85 percent contained residues of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), 11 percent contained residues of dieldrin, 43 percent contained residues of heptachlor epoxide, 17 percent contained residues of ocychlordane, 22 percent contained residues of hexachlorobenzene, and 15 percent contained residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (Stendell and others, 1988) .\n\ns_00937: Particularly, augmented image data were generated using image translation and non-rigid deformable image registration techniques."
