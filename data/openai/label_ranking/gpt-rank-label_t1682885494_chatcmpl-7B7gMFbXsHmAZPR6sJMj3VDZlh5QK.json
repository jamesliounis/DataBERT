The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00592: Accelerate technology development to study the human brain.\n\ns_00684: The spatial distribution of the June to November TCHP is roughly a reflection of the warm pool ( Figure 5a).\n\ns_00734: Ozone has \"[diamage functions that are derived from laborabeen linked to leaf damage and reduced seed size tory or controlled experiments are not necessarily which correlate directly to reduced yields (Barse et correlated closely with actual farm situations.\n\ns_00784: Our finding that the Hispanic-White gap in science is significantly reduced when controlling for prior reading achievement lends some preliminary support to this hypothesis.\n\ns_00834: Thereafter, a memorandum of understanding between the two universities was drawn up, and funding was sought for the intervention.\n\ns_00884: In Wyoming, the mean slope of 23 nest sites was 14.26 degrees (\u00b0), and the mean height of nests was 4.55 m (MacLaren and others, 1988).\n\ns_00934: The built-in RF implementation TreeBagger in Matlab (R2013a) was adopted to train the model, and default values were used for other parameters.\n\ns_00984: 2b also the results of the analysis relative to the summer months (June through August).\n\ns_01034: Using tank pressure, hydrostatic pressure, pipeline radius, material properties and pipeline geometry (length and bends) velocity and pressure at each location in the pipeline can be calculated.\n\ns_01084: The t-test is used to compare means when only two groups are present.\n\ns_01134: All continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and, thus, estimates correspond to effect sizes.\n\ns_01184: For example, the depression that formed on May 10, 2003, intensified to a TC as it travelled over an anticyclonic eddy with a positive SSHA value.\n\ns_01234: Participants with lower baseline MMSE categories tended to be older, less educated, and more likely to be female than those in higher categories (Table 2 ).\n\ns_01284: For example, as discussed in an OECD (2016a) study, businesses tend to place greater significance on the technical perspective of each discipline of digital literacy.\n\ns_01334: We identified 17 studies that evaluated heterogeneity in symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders (Additional file 1).\n\ns_01384: This applies to some of the potentially useful measures in psychosis, such as MRI scanning or a blood sample for whole genome sequencing, whereas others may require technology that is relatively inaccessible (eg, positron emission tomography-PET-scanning) or analyses that are currently relatively expensive (eg, proteomics).\n\ns_01434: Three cold events (1986~1988, 1993, and 1996) and three warm events (1990~1991, 1994, and 1998~2002) can be identified either from the spatial-mean SSTA or the first mode SSTA.\n\ns_01484: Our study showed again that female researchers have followed somewhat different career paths than male researchers have.\n\ns_01534: Th e standard deviation ( Fig.\n\ns_01584: To access impacts of extreme hydrological events such as hurricanes, storms, and high tides on coastal/estuarine areas with infrastructure, the most important capabilities of numerical models are to be able to accurately and robustly predict coastal flooding/inundation and coastal morphological changes due to these combined hydrological conditions over large-scale coastal/estuarine regions .\n\ns_01634: Genomic libraries were prepared with the ligation kit 1D SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and sequenced using a FLO-MIN106-R9.4 flow cell and the MinION instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK).\n\ns_01684: Such concurrent analysis of multiple timepoints for one patient has been implemented in the CLADA software for longitudinal cortical atrophy measurement [50] and in the FreeSurfer software package for cortical thickness measurement and deep GM volumetry [51] , while another paper demonstrated how difference images, obtained by subtracting coregistered images from two timepoints, may be used in the automated quantification of lesion volume change [52] .\n\ns_01734: Inclusion in the risk-adjusted model resulted in insufficient power to make the individual categorical HRs meaningful.\n\ns_01784: For each 1 \u2264 r \u2264 R and k \u2208 G(k), letX (r,k) be the completed data in Group r using imputed values based on Group k, andX (r,k) be the samples in Group r but with missing values in the i-th sample replaced by E(X m(r) |X iJ(r,k) ).\n\ns_01834: While the approach we adopt is commonly used [14, 35] , our findings may be subject to underestimated segregation indices [35] ."
