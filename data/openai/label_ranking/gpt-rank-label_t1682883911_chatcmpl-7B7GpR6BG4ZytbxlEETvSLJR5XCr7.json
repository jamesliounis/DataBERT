The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00799: Furthermore, triangulation was used to compare the participant observations with the interview findings.\n\ns_00849: However, betweenyear re-use of nest sites was lower in the high-intensity area than in the low-intensity area and lower than in other parts of the species' range.\n\ns_00899: However, Bayesian optimization methods could be used to tune our models (Snoek et al., 2012) , and better performance could be obtained.\n\ns_00949: Additionally, we have compared these results with a 30 years long 15 run of the atmospheric regional model WRF in non-hydrostatic setup, at 4 Km horizontal resolution, forced with ERA-Interim data (Pieri et al., 2015) .\n\ns_00999: Results of this simplified model will be compared with results using FLOW 3D.\n\ns_01049: The mean separation tests for income and wealth based on age group are shown in tables 4, 5, and 6.\n\ns_01099: We use data from the 2009 FACES cohort, which followed a nationally representative sample of 3,349 3-and 4-year-old first-time Head Start attendees across 486 classrooms.\n\ns_01149: 2000;Goni and Trinanes 2003;Pun et al.\n\ns_01199: Of the 2888 participants with AD in these 10 studies, 6 were excluded due to missing data, yielding a total of 2882 participants for analysis.\n\ns_01249: Studies that highlight the best practices to do so, are reviewed and critiqued.\n\ns_01299: The objective of this study was to systematically review the epidemiologic evidence for potential patterns of heterogeneity of common mood and anxiety disorders over the lifecourse in the general population.\n\ns_01349: Data are being collected at first presentation and again at a number of follow-up timepoints, with the same instruments and methodological procedures being used at each site.\n\ns_01399: All the data were prepared over the common period, 1985~2002, after removing the annual cycle and applying a 13-month moving average.\n\ns_01449: The study focuses on three federal agencies: the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)-and, in particular, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which accounts for 99 percent of the research funding in DHHS; the NSF; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\ns_01499: Th e NARR provides a long-term, consistent, high-resolution climate data set that represents the best available proxy of observations.\n\ns_01549: This extreme typhoon event with a 100-year return period was determined beforehand by using the historical data of typhoons passing through the island from 1897 to 2001.\n\ns_01599: This study was performed following the ethical standards noted in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.\n\ns_01649: The method proposed by Ait-Ali et al.\n\ns_01699: Threshold for significance was based on a 2-sided P value of .05 or less.\n\ns_01749: For instance, for Group 2 in Figure 1 , the above method treats the covariates in Sources 1 and 2 as predictors and ignores information from Source 3.\n\ns_01799: We used the findings above to examine the research hypotheses.\n\ns_01849: the National Education Longitudinal Study: 1988-94 andBeginning Postsecondary Student Study: 1989-90 Linkage Data File Data Analysis System (DAS) (see appendix B for a description of the DAS).\n\ns_01899: However, to maximize the utility of biofluid samples for the evaluation of new biomarkers, the subjects from which they were obtained must have a reliable and accurate clinical and neuropathological diagnosis.\n\ns_01949: In order to assess the representativeness of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study sample to the UK general population, it was compared to data from the UK Census 2011 for adults aged 18 years + .\n\ns_01999: This revealed a multiple R of .6 with an adjusted R 2 of .36 (F[3,603] = 113.18, p < .0001)."
