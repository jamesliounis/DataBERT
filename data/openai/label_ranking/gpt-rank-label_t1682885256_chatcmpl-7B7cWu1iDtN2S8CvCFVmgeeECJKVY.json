The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07711: Table 1, col. 5 gives the ratio of producers' surplus under optimal pricing to that under panterritorial pricing by zone for a =0.67.\n\ns_07761: For the other parts of the study we use the conventional measure of the consolidated fiscal deficit as set out in section 1 above.\n\ns_07811: The approach led to a model that is extremely robust, provides an excellent fit of the data, and is very close to the initial model in both specification and sample.\n\ns_07861: The base case scenario, as explained in the subsection of cost/benefit analysis, takes the following assumptions, which are the most likely based on the available information: vehicle operating cost savings based on per vehicle savings from Tanzania and other African countries, as well as traffic flows in each of the roads; operating costs of US$1.4 million.\n\ns_07911: The first part of this section is devoted to the simplest model that can be formulated to evaluate the impact of tax holidays on investment.\n\ns_07961: Similarly, the results of this study show that the revenue potential of the ASWC is tremendous, and that the population of Onitsha would be much better served if the ASWC viewed itself as a regulated utility, not as an agency providing a social service.\n\ns_08011: In addition, the adoption of a DIS also has potential implications for the conduct of monetary policy and the design of other institutional mechanisms, in particular the central bank's lender of last resort facilities, as well as its impact on the risks faced by it as supervisory agency.\n\ns_08061: Larger household size, which could indicate the availability of free household labor to chop and transport fuelwood, and ownership of a wood plot, may make fuelwood an even cheaper alternative heating fuel.\n\ns_08111: Here we shall focus on the case in which the trajectories of these variables are given arbitrarily and the government has some initial debt B.\n\ns_08161: The 1750 estimate from Lees and Hohenberg (1989: p. 443) .\n\ns_08211: The gains are less clearly ordered when it comes to the role of initial human capital, reflecting a trade-off: those with low initial human capital face both a higher marginal return to investing in college (in part because they experience lower foregone earnings while in college) and a higher risk of noncompletion.\n\ns_08288: The survey yields information about incoming students on a range of topics including general demographics, academic performance, student values, and decisions regarding college selection and financing education.\n\ns_08338: For all variables, except the variable school closures which is in a suitable dataset format by the UNESCO, the coding of the data is done directly in a Stata do file via lines of coding.\n\ns_08388: The transferrin genetic variant C2 has been investigated and shown to have a small but significant association (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17, in a meta analysis of 19 studies [24] ).\n\ns_08438: Since we want a region that is common in most of the subjects, we consider that values under 50% of overlapping are discarded.\n\ns_08488: Although the human AD biomarker and imaging cascade is sure to be refined and advanced, the current data strongly support the following hypothetical scenario.\n\ns_08538: 2015) , NSOs which show better fitting accuracies to the WIC 2015 back-projection dataset, but also from UIS which are exhaustive in terms of countries.\n\ns_08588: Although SVM 10 and SVM 25 (see (a-b)) were able to identify a few interesting features, the selected features varied a lot among di3erent crossvalidation trials.\n\ns_08638: By 2011, the number of opioid treatment programs in urban counties providing buprenorphine had risen to 11.4 for each opioid treatment program in a rural county, and the number of substance abuse treatment facilities in urban counties providing buprenorphine had risen to 9.5 for each substance abuse treatment facility in a rural county.\n\ns_08688: The authors' commitment to TIMSS-2003 stems probably from their desire to propel African economies through the development and use of science, mathematics and technology.\n\ns_08738: In sum, they have used many of the traditional skill assessment approaches described in the literature.\n\ns_08788: This was somewhat surprising, as prior research has shown that those with chronic conditions are more likely to participate.\n\ns_08838: Other hyperparameters such as the learning rate, the weight decay, the batch size, the data preprocessing and the intensity normalization were also part of the search.\n\ns_08888: He also reflects Brannen and Nilsen's (2005) contention that youth choices are still shaped by their cultural background, and are not, as is often claimed, highly individualized.\n\ns_08938: He suggested that SADs follow a very specific form of the lognormal curve which he called the canonical distribution."
