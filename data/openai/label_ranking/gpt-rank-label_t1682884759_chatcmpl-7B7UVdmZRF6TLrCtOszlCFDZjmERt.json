The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08725: These skill scores were computed by comparing the OFS outputs with observations (at 6min intervals) for the twelve month period of calendar year 2008.\n\ns_08775: Despite these limitations, this is the largest study of its kind using a representative sample.\n\ns_08825: The population of ADNI and AIBL are described in Table 1 .\n\ns_08875: For example, Brannen and Nilsen's (2005) comparative study of young Europeans found that youth views of the future were not, in fact, converging towards individualization.\n\ns_08925: Pielou noted this in the context of SADs (1977, p. 123) .\n\ns_08975: On the basis of a summary of 25 (unspecified) years of observation starting in the 1930s, according to their definition, breakup at Point Barrow happened at the earliest and latest on 15 June and 24 August, respectively, with an average given as 24 July [Kniskern and Potocsky, 1965].\n\ns_09025: We then summed each block-level SES and racial counts and divided them by their respective universes of housing units and population to create aggregated, neighborhood-level percent measures.\n\ns_09075: Results show a reduced bias of TC track for CRTL2 than CRTL1 so that impacts of the polar-orbital satellite data on TC track are further validated.\n\ns_09125: The proposed methodology is evaluated using the LDA, its quadratic variant-Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and SVM as binary classifiers.\n\ns_09175: Table 10 shows the distribution of the 35,540 sample members determined to be eligible at the start of BPS:12/17 data collection, by study member status and survey response status, and identifies groups that were fielded (included in data-collection activities with an objective of obtaining a complete survey) in BPS:12/17.\n\ns_09225: It seems reasonable, then, to look elsewhere for evidence of the farm-level impacts of these technologies.\n\ns_09275: As demonstrated in the fully adjusted analysis, those who were employed were more active.\n\ns_09325: This process can be identified in the MRI images by comparing images of the same patient, at different times (denoted as \"longitudinal studies\").\n\ns_09375: In the following, we report classification experiments for time windows of 2 years and 3 years, given that a one-year time window does not provide a sufficient number of converters for statistically meaningful comparisons.\n\ns_09425: More importantly, the strength of the association between BMI and AC severity was reduced and was no longer significant after the analysis was adjusted for BMD, suggesting a mediation effect of BMD, as depicted in Figure 1 and previously proposed by Kovacic and colleagues 8 .\n\ns_09475: In this regard, the potential limitation of this finding is the limited number of sequences available for analysis.\n\ns_09525: This method has got several advantages over RT-PCR in being specific, user friendly in detection, speed (turnaround time is 20 min) and less background.\n\ns_09575: Sixth, after developing a relatively comprehensive list of studies, we asked knowledgeable colleagues to review the list and alert us to any studies that were overlooked.\n\ns_09625: To further investigate the underlying causes of gender gaps in non-school study time we estimate versions of (1) Reassuringly, sensitivity analyses reported in the online appendix confirm the robustness of the OLS estimates.\n\ns_09675: Nevertheless, having a different systematic approach, which focuses on cortical thickness and validated for different group classifications, including early MCI (EMCI) and later MCI (LMCI), to aid in the diagnosis and understanding of AD progression would be highly advantageous to the preclinical AD research.\n\ns_09725: The overall sample size after five surveys was 12,144 participants.\n\ns_09775: Although our method based on a single modality can guarantee a high level of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity, some limitations and disadvantages also exist in our method: (1) Due to the limited data in the ADNI database, we only used a limited data set, so the network structure used in our experiment to discover information from MCI is not necessarily suitable for other data sets.\n\ns_09825: The results in phase 3 of this study were consistent with those of Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.\n\ns_09875: Prediction results for transitions to dementia -in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) -and MSE improvements for longitudinal forecasts can be found in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.\n\ns_09925: Using earnings data from 1998, they found that returnees earned 5 percent premium over those who never left."
