The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01363: Figure 1 and table 1 show the design of the PSYSCAN study.\n\ns_01413: Hence, the relationship of JES SSTA variability to the environment variables can be interpreted using the (lagged) correlation coefficient on an assumption of linearity.\n\ns_01463: The RAND report grew out of an amendment to the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, proposed by Senator Wyden, that ordered the science foundation to \"assess gender differences in the distribution of external federal research and development funding.\"\n\ns_01513: Th ese two parameters were validated indirectly by comparing the model total irrigated water amounts with U.S. statewide observations.\n\ns_01563: This integrated model for simulation of coastal estuarine morphodynamic processes has been built in a software package called CCHE2D (Jia et al., 2002) , which is a general tool to analyze two-dimensional (2D) shallow water flows, sediment transport, and water quality, with natural flow boundary conditions.\n\ns_01613: Funding This work was funded by Instituto Nacional de Salud.\n\ns_01663: In contrast, a recent paper on MS demonstrated that, following a standardized imaging protocol and identical longitudinal VBM analysis methods, the differences between centers in the longitudinal VBM changes observed in MS patients are much smaller than the disease-related changes, indicating that pooling of data from different centers may be feasible for longitudinal VBM analysis in MS [94] .\n\ns_01713: This study also reveals a number of prognostic factors, of which the most important is J AM ACAD DERMATOL VOLUME 78, NUMBER 3 thought to be cancer staging.\n\ns_01763: Specifically, Table 6 shows that the mean RMSE of the proposed method is smaller than that of any other method under two missing rates, even though the proposed method selects fewer variables than most of the other methods, which implies that the proposed method selects variables more accurately.\n\ns_01813: This hypothesis was confirmed as the OLS models tend to overestimate the importance of segregation (see both Tables 2 and 3 ).\n\ns_01863: Appendix CNELS/BPS Merged Data File Methodology Report Overview The National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/94) data set is a rich source of data on the relationship between high school experiences and early postsecondary outcomes.\n\ns_01913: The INDD contains the number and type of available aliquots from each sample (CSF, plasma, or serum), day of sampling, the INDDID, sample ID, and the physical location of the samples.\n\ns_01963: Indeed, the topics covered within the survey were empirically derived, based on previous epidemic and pandemic research and matched many of the research priorities previously mentioned.\n\ns_02013: A multiple R of .68 was obtained with an adjusted R 2 of .46 (F(2,604) = 259.04, p < .0001).\n\ns_02063: 124 A clinical study (NCT04328272) suggested that COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ showed improvement in clinical 128 However, the death rate of the administration with HCQ (25.7%) was barely higher than that of standard treatment (23.5%).\n\ns_02113: Overall incidence rates were not calculated due to lack of population-at-risk data for most countries.\n\ns_02163: This is true for research paper as well as patent citations.\n\ns_02213: Compared to healthy agers, memory decliners alone had 3.4 to 4.3 times higher risk for developing dementia (p<0.01).\n\ns_02246: Therefore, the regression coefficients from the models represented the associations of WMHs with temporoparietal and frontal metabolism (relative to temporoparietal).\n\ns_02296: A methodology outlined in the Irene Tropical Cyclone Report [Avila and Cangialosi, 2011] and data on insured loss estimates from Insurance News Net [Jeffries, 2011] were used to derive a set of three damage estimates.\n\ns_02346: As a limitation, our sample size for CN was small, and thus, the lack of associations for this group should be interpreted with caution.\n\ns_02396: 644 Li, Y., & Li, M. (2011).\n\ns_02446: We used a model of attributing patients to the PCP who provided the most care.\n\ns_02496: Many population genetic and phylogenetic methods exist to discriminate among multiple evolutionary processes or models, but the majority of methods utilize summary statistics that reduce sequence information into a condensed numerical or graphical output 4, 5 .\n\ns_02546: A test of the null hypothesis that r 2 5 0 uses a Wald or Lagrange Multiplier test."
