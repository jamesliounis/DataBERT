The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02645: However, remission appeared to moderate the association between cortisol slope defined by the difference between maximal and minimal cortisol levels during the nyctemera, and certain cognitive tasks assessing processing speed and executive function (Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .\n\ns_02695: At each SAT score, black students currently are substantially more likely than are whites to apply to the most selective institutions (see Figure 7 , using the institutional data).\n\ns_02745: The development of a useful common classification that accommodated differences in detail across the four different land cover classifications (Table 1) required us to significantly simplify each classification.\n\ns_02795: Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of our findings.\n\ns_02845: Effect sizes need to be interpreted in context; effects sizes in similar studies such as the child care studies were all considered small (McCarthney and Rosenthal 2000) .\n\ns_02895: The U.S. Census Bureau's Methods Panel Web (MPWEB) survey tested whether the Internet is a viable reporting method for such surveys, especially those that utilize large, complex instruments.\n\ns_02945: To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrast was used.\n\ns_02995: First, the study broadened previous studies dedicated to motivation of pupils and increasing their learning engagement (through improving teaching skills and, accordingly, optimizing teaching and learning) (Niyivuga, Otara & Tuyishime, 2019) .\n\ns_03045: From each volunteer, two T13D (scan-rescan) and one axial-PD/T2-FSE volumes (8 sites, 1 subject per site, 16 T13D acquisitions, 8 Dual Echo FSE acquisitions) were obtained.\n\ns_03095: Multifunctionality was defined for the purpose of this study to include participation in conservation programs and reported income from recreational and agritourism activities.\n\ns_03145: In column (2) the dependent variable is the match-intensity.\n\ns_03195: See Gilbert (1996, 2005 andGardner (1985) for excellent surveys of international agreements.\n\ns_03245: Interestingly, the data in Table 2 A similar pattern is also observed in the final-goods computer industry.\n\ns_03295: The table shows the summary statistics of the coefficients of the two factor model regression:\n\ns_03345: The dataset covers 101 countries over the period 2004-07.\n\ns_03395: Table 4 reports values of CEEC-10 imports and exports of parts sorted in descending order according to the value of imports in 1998.\n\ns_03445: In a recent paper,Cabral and Ross (2008) question the received wisdom that sunk costs create a barrier to entry.\n\ns_03495: 31 To eliminate the effect of recurrent volatility, we also include in the regressions the standard deviation of normalized private credit.\n\ns_03545: 13 The other explanatory variables are the same as those presented in Table 3 , although the first six columns exclude industry dummies, but control for a sector\"s financial dependence, competitiveness and contestability, proxied by the Herfindahl index, the \"natural\" rate of entry and of employment turnover.\n\ns_03595: The empirical model we use to test these relationships is the following:\n\ns_03645: The new issues we are proposing-by no means comprehensive or exhaustiveoffer a greater chance for reciprocity to work.\n\ns_03695: Using a meta-analysis based on 49 studies on OECD countries, Ligthart and Martin Suarez (2011) report an output elasticity of public capital of 0.14.\n\ns_03745: The last columns shows our measure of the extent to which the court rulings have a pro-poor impact, taken from the tables above.\n\ns_03795: From a methodological point of view, our analysis draws on the theoretical framework of Madan and Unal (2000) whose structural model of the hazard (default) rate implies that credit spreads are linearly related to firm-specific exogenous variables.\n\ns_03845: A subset of 661 respondents (randomly selected from the full set of baseline respondents in a manner described in section 2.4 below) make up the stage two sample to be revisited."
