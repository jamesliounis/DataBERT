The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02660: These factors may include life events (Ouanes et al., 2017a) , personality (Ouanes et al., 2017b; Tautvydaite et al., 2017; Terracciano et al., 2017) , sleep disorders (Haba-Rubio et al., 2017) , depression (Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .\n\ns_02710: Our most hopeful simulations assume that, conditional on income, black students' scores relative to white students' will rise at the same rate over the next quarter century as a linear trend fit to the 1970-1998 experience.\n\ns_02760: Nevertheless, this work permitted Wolter et al.\n\ns_02810: The study was approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board.\n\ns_02860: An important limitation of the present study is the issue of causality.\n\ns_02910: Collectively, encryption, authentication, and a firewall provide a secure method for the Census Bureau to collect data on the Internet (Kanarek and Sedivi, 2000;Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000).\n\ns_02960: In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics, a number of issues must be kept in mind.\n\ns_03010: Together with the introduction of these educational innovation practices, the participants in this study have formulated such challenges as: a) adaptation to a changed role (Durlak & DuPre, 2008) ; b) establishing productive collaboration with other teachers (Fullan, 2014) .\n\ns_03060: Subsequently, we compared the homogeneity variances of ICV among scanners of the two different cohorts stratified by strength field.\n\ns_03110: 2 The coefficients in the logit model are difficult to interpret, but the effect of marginal changes on the odds ratio for a unit change in one of the independent variables can be easily computed.\n\ns_03160: Second, to ensure the replicability of our \u2026ndings, we coded the topics by keyword searches 6 .\n\ns_03210: World stock-to-use ratios for the sum of the three major grains (corn, wheat, and rice) (Source: USDA Foreign Agricultural Service -Production Supply and Distribution)\n\ns_03260: In turn, we discuss results of ad-hoc two-regime models, where the data are divided into two groups depending on rankings based on technology selection variables, namely factor endowments, IPRs, TFP, and relative factor costs.\n\ns_03310: Although the earlier literature emphasized the benefits of these alternative sources of financing (Feldman and Schmidt, 2001; Calomiris, 1999) , some voices of concern about the implications of this liability structure for systemic vulnerability have recently been raised.\n\ns_03360: The new aggregate indicators contain the information of a wider range of individual indicators than any previous study.\n\ns_03410: First, old connections due to previous existence within the same state still seem to matter.\n\ns_03460: 1 4 When we apply the Wooldridge test on (18) we obtain F = 57:31 and P rob > F = 0:00.\n\ns_03510: The filtered variables are then regressed on the splines and the expected values are plotted.\n\ns_03560: Section 3 summarizes our hypotheses and explains our approach.\n\ns_03610: Table 2 provides annual average distance-to-default measure for different regions.\n\ns_03660: Here it is relevant that China's dominance will be associated at least initially not with technological leadershipas in the case of its predecessors Britain and the US but with technological catch-up.\n\ns_03710: Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia (2010) argue that -each dollar raised spent by a Sub-Saharan African government has a marginal cost of public funds of almost 20 percent\u2016.\n\ns_03760: The survey sought to unearth a complete or representative sample of cases in each country involving the right to health and health care, and the right to education.\n\ns_03810: Furthermore, our results highlight the interdependence of debt finance and risk distribution recently identified in the context of hedging by Mello and Parsons (2000) .\n\ns_03860: In this section we first describe the results from stage one of the experiment, and we define key variables from the choices made under commitment used in the analysis of revision behavior in stage two."
