The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00138: Nelson (2004) noted that mothers' reports of objective measures such as this one often agree with fathers' reports, which implies that they might be relied on when father reports are absent.\n\ns_00188: In the original VoxelMorph paper, a cross correlation neighborhood size of 9 3 is used.\n\ns_00238: Additionally, they also record the date of death.\n\ns_00285: Possibly the most important reason for this discrepancy is that, in the ADNI study [17] , the mean age was 75 years, and in the study by Whitwell et al.\n\ns_00335: 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] Accordingly, LC-MS/MS is able to lessen interferences, has better specificity, and reduce between-method bias.\n\ns_00385: A dedicated website and knowledge center has been developed to disseminate project information and results, and inform people about how to use and maximize the benefits from this type of technology (LeaCox, 2013 ).\n\ns_00435: Among several reference regions, core white matter provided the greatest sensitivity for the detection of longitudinal changes.\n\ns_00485: The administration of Booklet 2 to Korean and Turkish students was selected for the DINA model analyses in this study due to the following reasons: (a) there were relatively more topics-13-in Booklet 2; (b) the subject areas of the items were distributed evenly-nine items for Numbers, nine items for Algebra, seven items for Data and Chance, and seven items for Geometry; and (c) the cognitive domains among the items were also distributed evenly-10 items required knowing, 13 items required applying, and nine items required reasoning.\n\ns_00535: We chose Random Forests because of its high predictive power, ability to model unspecified variable interactions and correlated variables, its ranking of variable importance, and its demonstrated use for bioclimatic species distribution models [27, 28] .\n\ns_00585: Perhaps unrecognized in the broader scientific community, those efforts have achieved remarkable success related to many conditions, including autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and common, late-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\ns_00635: Depending on virus strains and cell types, proteins may be cleaved by one or several host proteases, including Furin, trypsin, Cathepsins, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) orTMPRSS-4.\n\ns_00677: The June and July maps show small areas of increasing (decreasing) CI of up to 16 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 (24 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ) in magnitude.\n\ns_00727: and then used the estimated parameters to extrap-found that adjusting experimental exposures to olate to region-level damages.\n\ns_00777: Our analytic sample (n=10,050) included students with science test scores in kindergarten and first grade as well as available data on race/ethnicity and gender and dropped observations missing prior math and reading achievement scores, information on SES, or school indicators.\n\ns_00827: The participants were observed during the LLP contact sessions.\n\ns_00877: In eastern Colorado, Ferruginous Hawks nested more frequently in grassland areas than in cultivated areas (Olendorff, 1973; .\n\ns_00927: Ordinal regression based on CNNs has also been adopted for age estimation, and achieved better performance than state-of-theart alternative techniques (Niu et al., 2016) .\n\ns_00977: Since we study the response of the state of the upper ocean to intense wind events, and since we can safely assume that the nature of this interaction has not changed with time, we only have a problem of loss of statistics rather than of biasing.\n\ns_01027: A schematic representation of the model is given in Figure 7 .\n\ns_01077: While farm households on average are comparable to nonfarm households in well-being, the results from this study show that different types of farm and nonfarm households differ significantly from each other.\n\ns_01127: Although age composition influences overshadowed those related to classroom quality, there are important takeaway messages specific to these findings.\n\ns_01177: A correspondence is observed between the intensification/dissipation of the TCs and the altimetry-derived SSHA fields (Fig.\n\ns_01227: Post hoc analyses from some AD clinical trials have shown more rapid progression of disease with more severe baseline impairment [2] , suggesting the possibility of a differential response to treatment.\n\ns_01277: The report further mentions that measuring ICT impact is complex and comparable statistics are limited and therefore the selection of indicators need to be refined in future (Baller et al.\n\ns_01327: Using a probability sample of 1,972 Black and White adults age 65 and older from five counties in North Carolina, a significant association was found between stress growth and growth of depressive symptoms, particularly among Blacks [65, 66] ."
