The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03859: For comparison purposes, column 2 of Table 2 reports the simulated distribution of consistent choices if participants were to choose consumption randomly.\n\ns_03909: In this report we used the average of the VSL and HCA values for adults (i.e.\n\ns_03959: As was the case in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , the same estimation techniques are used to calculate the capacity of countries in total fiscal revenue (tax plus non-tax collection) generation, which is named as fiscal revenue capacity, and their effort in revenue generation, named as fiscal revenue effort.\n\ns_04009: Table 13 shows the actual and predicted annual pregnancy probabilities by region, schooling level, and polygamy status of the husband.\n\ns_04059: In a cross-section, one ought in principle to be able to parcel out the effects of policies along the lines of the cross-country regressions above.\n\ns_04109: This paper does not re-examine the case for a multi-pillar structure and does not focus on the relative importance of different pillars.\n\ns_04159: Third, we obtained similar results using the Worldscope data, as further described in Section 4.3.\n\ns_04209: Finally, the expected market value of the initial debt is given by, for e > -V = DJ f(eh)dEh + J (XYh-C)f(eh)deh.\n\ns_04259: To focus on the interesting case suppose the parameters above are such that the following two conditions hold:\n\ns_04309: At a 10% (or in fact 6%) significance level the null of 'no Granger causality' would also be rejected for the USA.\n\ns_04359: The core weakness in any causal interpretation of the estimates in columns (1) -(3) taken in isolation is that the shift in enrollment toward private primary schools may reflect a simple secular trend of increasing demand for high-quality schooling.\n\ns_04409: This result highlights the presence of the type of trade deflection discussed in this paper.\n\ns_04459: In particular, the standard unitary model of the household seems particularly unlikely to hold in a migration context due to information asymmetries and to limits on monitoring within the household (de Laat, 2008; Chen, 2013; Ambler, 2013 , Doi et al, 2014 ).\n\ns_04509: In addition, the survey obtained data on the proportion of workers in the firm covered by any kind of collective wage agreement, internal or external.\n\ns_04559: Section 3 then introduces the attempts at application and quantification at a general level, particularly in the policy context, and presents a critique.\n\ns_04609: As argued above, the most relevant multiplier appears to be the one corresponding to cell (2,1), which is the case of procyclical \u2026scal policy (contractionary \u2026scal policy in bad times).\n\ns_04659: Third, the paper attempts to measure the relative contributions of each circumstance to total inequality of opportunity.\n\ns_04709: Column (1) of Table 2 shows that the coefficients on the two interaction terms are large, positive, and statistically significant at the 1% level.\n\ns_04759: Results for total educational spending as well as spending on books and stationary, the main category of such expenses, in table 3 point towards strongly positive second generation effects from reform.\n\ns_04809: We report last the density of percentage changes in wealth in Figures 7e and 7g also in page 44 by integrating the 3D graph in Figure 7a over the estimated range of x and weighting each b point using both the credit and no-credit wealth distribution 3 7 .\n\ns_04859: Returning to our benchmark estimation result in column 2 of table 3, we find that current owners or manager of business, as well as those who have been business angels in the past are more likely to start new businesses (Minniti et al., 2005; Mickiewicz, 2005; Aidis et al., 2012) .\n\ns_04909: In Tanzania, there are about 45,000 enterprises that are formally registered according to the Central Register of Establishments data in 2010.\n\ns_04959: This compares well with the estimates of Ingram and Fay (1994) who calculated that on average developing countries spend about 0.8% of GDP on roads (which certainly does not include full funding for maintenance.)\n\ns_05009: In the second panel of Table 2 , we can see that a country with no participation in GVCs would have a REER elasticity of -1.75, therefore, on average, GVC participation reduces REER elasticity by approximately 40 percent (-1.75+1.06/-1.75).\n\ns_05059: Although firm census data are scarce, especially in developing countries, it is safe to speculate that exporting is rare among firms."
