The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06171: This is done either assuming that the missingness pattern of the data is exogeneous or endogenous-as in our model-relying on proper identification to model these various selection processes.\n\ns_06221: To collect information about levels of vaccine hesitancy and what factors could be contributing to it, a phone survey covering 2,533 households was in the field from May 26 to June 6, 2021.\n\ns_06271: One might worry about using old harmonized national poverty lines given that the statistical capacity of most countries is increasing over time and given that using old poverty lines relies on many years of CPI data.\n\ns_06321: Visually, this suggests that perhaps it is the lowest ability children which were kept unschooled in the treated areas, or put another way, that the treatment effects on increasing enrollment with cash transfers were more focused on higher ability children.\n\ns_06371: (2021) with data from Africa and delivers a measure of mobility comparable between countries that captures some long-term patterns over half a decade by netting out common (across countries) birth cohorts and census year effects.\n\ns_06421: This suggests that the positive eect in the full sample found earlier for rural India and the daughters in India is driven by the earlier cohorts.\n\ns_06471: The Ghana data comes from the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), which is the largest distributor in the country with operations in the southern and middle belts.\n\ns_06521: 3 This comparative analysis does not undermine the need for case studies that provide further insights into specific contexts such as, for example, the sudden and dramatic increase in political trust in El Salvador or the effects on trust that Constitutional referendums have (as recently held in Chile), to mention a few examples.\n\ns_06571: All budgets were converted from local currency to USD using a PPP adjusted exchange rate.3 Note that TPO budget differences between high-and low-income countries when controlling for export value are smaller, but the median TPO budget-to-export ratio is still twice as large for high income countries.\n\ns_06621: S See Neary and Roberts (1980) .\n\ns_06671: A final factor behind Sweden's decision was the observation that other Scandinavian countries had already adopted the integrated approach.\n\ns_06721: We estimated error correction versions of the equations as well, and finally estimated a parsimonious version of the equations, removing insignificant explanatory variables.\n\ns_06771: Khandker (1998) estimates that for every 100 taka lent to a woman, household consumption increases by 18 taka; interestingly the figure is 11 taka if the same amount was lent to a man.\n\ns_06821: The FARA annual reports contain the name and address of foreign agents, the name of the principals, the purpose of the agency and the amount of money in return for the agent's activities.\n\ns_06871: Since income and consumption are more easily measured and generally correlate well to other indicators of well-being, they tend to be the primary indicators used, especially in the quantitative analyses.\n\ns_06921: The impacts of differential (non-random) deaths and births in the period of length \u03c4 prior to the date in question are then:\n\ns_06971: For the sample of movers, an additional source of bias is introduced through selective matching.\n\ns_07021: Residents were asked about the type of housing, tenure status, and access to basic services in their previous residences.\n\ns_07071: As mentioned before, since late 1993, the DIEMs operated as a de facto Argentina's experience with these measures was certainly discouraging in relation to the use of WTO safeguards.\n\ns_07121: A complication, however, is that some munic\u00edpios experience splits over the study period, the total number growing from 4491 to 5507.\n\ns_07171: While intuitively straightforward, data collection on each of these liquidity variables posed some special challenges.\n\ns_07221: When a set of unrestricted child age dummies is included in the regression, the coefficient on the dummy variable for attrited children becomes insignificant: The coefficient is -0.033, with a robust standard error of 0.034.\n\ns_07271: Before discussing GATS commitments and the actual policies of transition economies, we focus on the EU schedules of services commitments in order to provide a baseline for comparison purposes.\n\ns_07321: In addition, ,u 1 is normalized to be 1, p,j for material, machine, and chemical industries are estimated to be 0.41, 0.35, and 0.48.\n\ns_07371: \u2022 The Republic of Korea (TN/TF/W/18) suggests that much paperwork and document-related costs can be reduced if the following suggestions were implemented: \u25ab Harmonization and standardization of document formats;
