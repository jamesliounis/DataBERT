The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02405: 73 studied analytically (Csanady, 1973; Winant, 2004).\n\ns_02455: Perhaps a broader scope of practice (like that characteristic of rural physicians) may lead to a decrease in LVC services, although this will need to be directly measured in future studies.\n\ns_02505: f, Comparison of mutations per genome in simulated genomes (1000 genomes x 8000 simulations), GISAID samples (mutations called using Wuhan reference genome), and COG UK samples (mutations called using an England reference genome).\n\ns_02555: Quantile regression techniques have an advantage in their ability to describe the differential impact of an explanatory variable across the response distribution.\n\ns_02605: The concentrations of glucose were determined, as well as ChT, LDL, HDL and TAG, by spectrophotometric method using reagent kits (Biolabo, Aqua-Med, Lodz).\n\ns_02655: Hence, elevated cortisol may lead, through its metabolic syndrome-associated effects on glucose, blood pressure and lipids, to an increased cardiovascular risk (Lattanzi and Silvestrini, 2017) .\n\ns_02705: To implement the \"integration\" approach, we match corresponding percentiles of the black, white, and overall school quality distributions, and re-assign the overall quality distribution to both blacks and whites.\n\ns_02755: Land cover changes in the Canadian portion of the basin (Table 4) largely paralleled those of the entire basin.\n\ns_02805: Stratifying by socioeconomic quintile, estimated risk differences for the preterm and early term groups compared with term children were similar across socioeconomic quintiles (Web Table 2 ).\n\ns_02855: A meta-analysis of 66 studies and 4000 families found that maternal sensitivity in mother-child interactions was highly correlated with secure attachment (De Wolff and van IJzendoorn 1997) .\n\ns_02905: The MPWEB tested whether the Internet is a viable reporting method for long, complex demographic survey instruments.\n\ns_02955: (The alpha statistic for each scale is shown in the Science experiments and equipment # Science Experiments (BYT2_26 --how often students conduct experiments) 1=None or .cone/mo (collapsed codes 4-5) 2=About one/mo( code 3) 3=About orie/wk (code 2) 4=About one/dy (code 1) Amount of science equipment (BY12_28 -Amount of science mem fix use) 1 1-2 pupils (collapsed codes 1-2) 2=Groups 3 or mon 3=Littk to now Comlition of equipnent (BYT2_29 -Coxlitioi of science equipment used) 1=Good to excellent (collapsed codes 1-2) 2=Fair\n\ns_03005: Our study found three types of a monitoring system specified by their purpose.\n\ns_03055: The description of the practical procedures concerning the image transmission of the data collected in this study on a centralized repository at the FBF has been detailed to every partner of the I-ADNI consortium.\n\ns_03105: In the far right column the values indicate the percentage change in the odds ratios for a one unit change in the independent variable.\n\ns_03155: We have also tested the hypothesis that in women reserved or caste reserved constituencies, the women and the members of the lower castes are more likely to have their priorities mentioned.\n\ns_03205: There is substantial agreement about the drivers of these longer run trends in grain consumption and prices.\n\ns_03255: Data on lending interest rates, a proxy for the cost of capital, come from the International Financial Statistics data-set of the IMF.\n\ns_03305: properly testing the hypothesis at this level would require controlling for other cross-country sources of return differences, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\ns_03355: Again, the idea of this stage is to run a diagnosis as to identify sub-groups or primary variables within hard-infrastructure indicators and within soft-infrastructure indicators that would have higher correlations.\n\ns_03405: Thus, Estonia's and Hungary's entry into global networks of multinationals producing 'office machinery equipment' have determined developments in CEEC trade with the EU over 1993-98 (Table 16) .20 There are, however, some indications of the potential for future growth in Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia.\n\ns_03455: ( pooled 1982, 1987, and 1992 data) Equation 15: Equation 18: In assessing the impact of intangible sunk costs on \u2026rm size dispersion, we limit our attention to advertising.\n\ns_03505: Annual country residuals are derived from the crosssectional estimates which are used to calculate annual country-group medians.\n\ns_03555: Columns 3 and 4 furthermore demonstrate that the results are robust to inclusion of sector-year dummies, which control for sector specific shocks and also shield against the impact of using inappropriate deflators.\n\ns_03605: The results in this paper have important policy implications."
