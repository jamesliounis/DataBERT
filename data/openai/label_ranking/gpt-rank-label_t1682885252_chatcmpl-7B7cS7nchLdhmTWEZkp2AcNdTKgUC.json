The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06461: Thus, comparatively, the results provide suggestive evidence that the electricity subsidies played a key role in the relatively high increase in electricity consumption during the COVID period in Ghana.\n\ns_06511: We rely on data from the Latinobar\u00f3metro 2020 and explore the existence of a relationship between trust in government and citizen participation in the LAC region.\n\ns_06561: This suggests that there was a strong demand for e-commerce training during COVID, and that this does not require large expenditures.\n\ns_06611: Whether or not deficits of this order are sustainable requires analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\ns_06661: In addition to reviewing these issues, this section will also consider the extent to which the alleged benefits of integrated regulation have actually been delivered in the Northern.\n\ns_06711: Data of the maturity structure of foreign liabilities are hard to come by, but according to BIS, of the US$29.2 billion total claims on Turkey at the end of 1997 by BIS-reporting international banks, 56.3% were claims of maturity up to and including one year.\n\ns_06761: ASA keeps paperwork requirements to a minimum, has decentralized most decision-making to the field and overall has a very lean operation (Choudhury 2003) .\n\ns_06811: Note that without this cleaning of the data the ratio of lobbying expenditure to potential tariff revenue foregone could be as high as 30,000, which is clearly misleading.\n\ns_06861: While these changes may have led to some improvements in well-being and reductions in rural poverty rates, the region is still characterized by persistent and stark inequalities in assets and incomes and high numbers of poor persons (Tejo 2000; Morley 2001; Sauma, 2002; Franko 2003; de Ferranti and others 2004) .\n\ns_06911: (1999) in which the country is the unit of observation for income and death rates.\n\ns_06961: That is, we can check whether among the movers, positive movements were correlated with higher absence reports.\n\ns_07011: Our main finding is that in situations with limited access to institutional housing finance in general, and for slum dwellers in particular, the ability of households to save regularly significantly improves their chances for moving out of slums.\n\ns_07061: In the case of Argentina, another negative consequence of this jurisprudence has been a tendency to shift petitions for import relief to the antidumping mechanism (see Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat, 2005) which in some cases is operating as a substitute safeguard mechanism (see Finger, 2002) .\n\ns_07111: For each model we present the results for both 2SLS and spatial GMM specifications.\n\ns_07161: Also, while the ADR Ratio is usually reported by major databases (e.g.\n\ns_07211: Note that the sample size for (1), the model that only uses the follow-up survey, is larger than the sum of the sample sizes for the two models that use both the baseline and follow-up surveys.\n\ns_07261: Essentially the index measures the success of policy on the basis of privatization of state-owned monopolies, liberalization, and progress in implementing a supporting legal, institutional and regulatory framework.\n\ns_07311: The parameters of interest are (a 1 ,a 2 ) , the effects of the PC on productivity levels and growth, respectively.\n\ns_07361: As a part of this development, a number of small agency-specific systems will need to be developed and implemented to ensure all key import/export related processes are able to be undertaken electronically.\n\ns_07411: The problem with this methodology is that it is sensitive to the data period chosen.\n\ns_07461: In sum, the results above corroborate those presented earlier, that is, that countries in the high group have not seen a worsening in their import capacity-despite what they receive is mostly ODA debt relief-mainly because multilateral sources have replaced bilateral sources in providing additional lending.\n\ns_07511: Mitchell and Andrews (1981) using 1975 data for defined benefit multiemployer plans and a log linear cost function found a mean cost of $49.03 per participant (1990 dollars) and large economies of scale.\n\ns_07561: coefficient estimates on openness) compare quite favorably with those for developing countries in other regions.\n\ns_07611: Thi calculzion is based on first column of state sector independent accounting units in 1980 and 1985 allow a trial calculation of energy consumption and energy productivity trends for collective industry durinig the period 1980/85.\n\ns_07661: This is a lengthy and complex process when unde:taken independently of a comprehensive debt workout, and may not be successful."
