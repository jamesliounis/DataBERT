The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07558: The volume, and timing may not have been perfect in each single case but their efforts need to be recognized.\n\ns_07608: Manipulation and interpretation of data portaining to Chinese industry (which includes mining, manufacturing and utilities) requires an appreciation of important concepts and data categories used by Chinese statisticians.\n\ns_07658: Such \"concerted packages\" were becoming more and more difficult to assemble, however, as skepticism grew in the commercial banking community about improved repayment prospects of the debtors.\n\ns_07708: A correlation of this variable with the distance from the ginnery or either of the delay-in-evacuation variables produced entirely statistically insignificant results (0.55, 0.34 and 0.45 levels of significance, respectively), indicating no relationship between these variables.\n\ns_07758: Buiter (1983) goes into some detail in presenting a set of stylized accounts that corresponds to an estimate of the comprehensive net wealth or permanent income accounts for the public sector.\n\ns_07808: Our analysis involved setting critical values for these variables and dropping observations in excess of these values.\n\ns_07858: Analytical accounting and other instruments would be put in place at an early stage of implementation of the proposed project, and the management and financial performance would be closely monitored through a systematic review of agreed-on performance indicators which are shown in Annex I and will be updated in the PIP in the course of project implementation.\n\ns_07908: In this section, the user cost of capital and effective tax rates for depreciable capital investments undertaken during and after the holiday period are estimated for the five countries described in Section II.\n\ns_07958: The real question for policy makers and managers working in the water sector is thus not whether they would prefer to have more reliable information obtained from studies carried out in accordance with rigorous social science research protocols versus the kind of information provided by the type of rapid reconnaissance surveys described in this paper.\n\ns_08008: A certain coverage level by the insurance scheme may for instance be perceived as optimal by a group of depositors and sub-optimal by another depending on their wealth.\n\ns_08058: We find that the inclusion of household per capita expenditures does not significantly affect any of the other explanatory variables coefficients, and report the results including per capita expenditures as one of the explanatory variables (as do most other energy studies).\n\ns_08108: Along the same lines, the evidence suggests that fulfillment of the Maastricht deficit targets sped up the decline of public investment in the EU countries: of the nine countries that exceeded the deficit target in 1992, eight met it in 1997; in all eight, public investment had fallen relative to GDP; and in seven, it had fallen relative to total primary expenditure as well.\n\ns_08158: The 1872 urbanization rate (share of cities 5,000 or greater) is 16.2 percent, interpolated between and 1900 from Bairoch (1988: Table 26,3, p. 423) .\n\ns_08208: This is not surprising, as college completion is nearly guaranteed for these individuals; given the large college earnings premium, the opportunity to invest in college is worth a lot to them.\n\ns_08285: While there are currently no databases focused specifically on college students with disabilities, several of the existing databases include datasets that provide information and perspective about the presence and experience of this population of college students.\n\ns_08335: The dataset was simply merged with our baseline dataset.\n\ns_08385: Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) based clumping was carried out on all SNPs in the discovery data, providing the most significantly associated SNP available in the target data set, in each region of LD (using PLINK clumping command with a pairwise r 2 threshold of 0.2 and a physical distance threshold of 300kb).\n\ns_08435: In AD vs CN problem we see that the best result is higher than 89% and it is given when we consider a \u03d5 = 0.7 and w = 3 in the XMT-DBSCAN algorithm.\n\ns_08485: Biomarkers and imaging, as discussed more extensively below, are likely to be essential for future prevention trials, perhaps to either exclude (primary prevention) patients with prodromal AD or select (secondary prevention) participants at risk for progression to symptomatic AD or for use as a surrogate outcome instead of assessing clinical status, and the costs and complexity will rise.\n\ns_08535: Detailed information about the data harmonization methodology can be found in Bauer et al.\n\ns_08585: A sparse learning model, elastic net logistic regression, was proposed to classify AD and MCI, and select disease-relevant biomarkers.\n\ns_08635: Since the 2006 legislation first allowing 100patient-waivered physicians, urban 100-patient-waivered physicians per capita have been significantly (p < 0.001, 2007-2011, inclusive) associated with greater amounts of buprenorphine per capita dispensed, with each additional urban 100-patient-waivered physician per capita associated with an additional 211 grams of buprenorphine dispensed per capita in 2007, rising to an additional 400 grams of buprenorphine dispensed per capita in 2011 (Table 3).\n\ns_08685: In this section, the achievements of eighth graders from participating African countries in mathematics and science are compared to that of students in some of the other forty-five countries that participated in TIMSS-2003.\n\ns_08735: A plot of the errors in hourly water levels at Baltimore, Maryland, (Fig 2) shows that the frequency of errors near the mean is greater than the normal (Gaussian) curve and smaller for values between one and two standard deviations away from the mean.\n\ns_08785: \";
