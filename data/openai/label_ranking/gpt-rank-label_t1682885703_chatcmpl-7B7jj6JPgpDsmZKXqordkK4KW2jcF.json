The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08698: It will also enable policy makers to identify the contextual variables that can be modified to bring about improvement in the learning and teaching of science and mathematics.\n\ns_08748: The SM will indicate how well the model reproduces the observed mean and the CF indicates how often the error is within acceptable limits.\n\ns_08798: This study is strengthened by the large representative sample of respondents in Arkansas who took part in the 2015 BRFSS.\n\ns_08848: We extended a visualization method to 3D medical imaging data and used it to better understand the decisions made by a classification network.\n\ns_08898: Finally, to reflect the regional differences in youth experiences, 34 interviews were conducted with young people living in the Greater London area, 44 were living in the north of England, 14 in the Midlands and 7 in the south of England.\n\ns_08948: The Akiake and Bayesian information criteria address these problems and also take us up to level 5 by using likelihood ratios and applying a penalty factor for using more parameters (Hilborn and Mangel 1997) .\n\ns_08998: All modeling studies acknowledged the contribution of dynamic processes to breakup of weakened ice.\n\ns_09048: Findings from this study provide helpful insight into the multiple environmental factors associated with open campus policy holding that were previously absent from the literature and potentially even unknown to the policy decision-makers themselves.\n\ns_09098: Therefore, the TC intensity forecast skill has improved slightly; however, these improvements are still statistically significant [101, 102] .\n\ns_09148: The accuracy of prediction of MCI to AD conversion and the associated \u03b7 is given in Table 2 .\n\ns_09198: Additional data collected during the administration of BPS:12/14 were available for use in preparing the sample for BPS:12/17, which was a subset of the BPS:12/14 sample.\n\ns_09248: The most consistent result from these studies is that transgenic field crops have been profitable.\n\ns_09298: To evaluate daily activity patterns, unadjusted median activity counts per minute were also assessed over the same 24-hour period ( Figure 1A) .\n\ns_09348: In addition, we used the leave-one-out cross validation method to test the usefulness of both the features and the classification methods.\n\ns_09398: Consequently, it is not surprising that FreeSurfer achieved relatively more accurate classification as morphometric differences between the groups under comparison were mainly localized in the hippocampal region as opposed to being widespread throughout the brain.\n\ns_09448: Use of medications was determined at each study visit according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system recommended by the World Health Organization.\n\ns_09498: The phylogenetic analysis showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was located outside of the main clades (S, G, and V) and clustered with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Australia, Canada, England and Kuwait (Fig 7) .\n\ns_09548: A trend has been observed where, SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly activates CD4 ?\n\ns_09598: Finally, we tested the effect of cohort standing, meaning the year when the sample of any given longitudinal study was born.\n\ns_09648: Specifically, the \"Research/Homework\" time-diary activity code includes non-school time spent doing required (assigned) homework and research, time spent doing homework and research for personal interest or fulfillment, waiting time associated with homework and research, and miscellaneous time associated with homework and research.\n\ns_09698: First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first sparse coding work formulated on the sphere domain although sparse coding has achieved great success on standard Euclidean image domains [9] and recently in the hyperbolic domain [10] .\n\ns_09748: This result suggests that, among the students who graduated with baccalaureate degrees from 4-year colleges, those who expected as eighth graders to have sciencerelated careers at age 30 were 1.9 times more likely to earn a life science baccalaureate degree than those who did not expect a science-related career.\n\ns_09798: We argue, therefore, that the proposed method can be a powerful means to represent neuroimaging biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of AD populations.\n\ns_09848: The results in table 2 demonstrate that, in general, the pre-service teachers displayed more success in solving the posed problems during phase 2.\n\ns_09898: , a max } is the set of indices for events that censor observations."
