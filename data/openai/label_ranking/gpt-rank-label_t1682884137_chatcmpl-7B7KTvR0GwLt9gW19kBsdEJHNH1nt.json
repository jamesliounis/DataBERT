The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09411: The validity of our data was substantiated by the fact that traditional risk factors associated with AC such as age, smoking and systolic blood pressure were highly predictive of increase severity of AC.\n\ns_09461: The reason for the high fraction of Australian cases in this cluster was possibly due to the high number of submitted sequences, as Australia was the third country that had the most sequences submitted to GISAID by April 2020.\n\ns_09511: Simultaneously, patients with DM showed lowered ACE2 expression possibly due to glycosylation, which explained increased comorbidity with severe lung injury and ARDS in COVID-19 patients [99, 100] .\n\ns_09561: The procedure as implemented in the DVBID library generates three estimators of missing studies, L 0 , R 0 , and Q 0 .\n\ns_09611: Panel B of table table A .2 reports the percentage of respondents who participated in three specific activities on the diary day that might \"crowd out\" homework time (Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) : organized extracurricular activities (including sport and non-sport activities), childcare (of household children), and work for pay (outside of household).\n\ns_09661: z i,t and D t denotes the value of z i and D in the t th epoch.\n\ns_09711: For example, let us compare the estimated probabilities for two pairs of prototypical students with all other variables set to means.\n\ns_09761: In the study by Lu 13 et al, the voxels in each ROI were clustered into patches through k-means clustering based on the Euclidean distance of their spatial coordinates, which means that voxels spatially close to each other would belong to the same patch.\n\ns_09811: A clear description of the problems is provided in the findings section.\n\ns_09861: ACM ISBN 978-x-xxxx-xxxx-x/YY/MM.\n\ns_09911: Yet the same international wage gap that created the opening for high-tech industry overall, and 43 percent in the total economy (authors' calculations from Table 3 of Central Bureau of Statistics 2002).\n\ns_09961: In fact, based on the correlations as the average salaries for the top ten school districts increase the percent of students meeting or exceeding standards decreases, which is statistically significant that is while controlling for the percent of low-income students.\n\ns_00013: In step 1, a user asks for data from multiple sites.\n\ns_00063: The reader should bear in mind that these results are consistent across PMQ cohorts spanning 6 years tracked longitudinally from 2001 to 2012 While these outcomes were found to be statistically significant, a greater type of significance is likely at play for young people.\n\ns_00113: This study used the first two waves of data, from when the children were about 9 months (unweighted SD = 1.9 months, range = 16.1 months) and 24 months (SD = 1.3 months, range = 21.4 months).\n\ns_00163: The improvement is statistically significant when using a paired t-test (p-value is 2.34\u00d710 \u221212 ).\n\ns_00213: The present study's objective is not to establish the \"real\" impact of mortality attributed to COVID-19 in Argentina and Colombia, but make an approximation given on the know information and the available sources.\n\ns_00260: As expected, patients scoring poorly at baseline showed a greater tendency toward conversion to dementia, defined as a GDS score of 4 Values denote means \u00b1 SD unless specified otherwise.\n\ns_00310: [53] [54] [55] [56] Previous data were contradictory and came from observational studies mainly based on inpatients with a poor health status, thus they were not representative on average of an aging population of men.\n\ns_00360: Greenhouse and container production practices across the country are likely to be similar to Maryland so the values reported in Table 5 for those WSIN applications are likely to be representative.\n\ns_00410: Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YS AZS DSM.\n\ns_00460: Using the attribute list in Table 2 , 32 items were coded independently by four doctoral students with advance degrees in mathematics education at one large public university in the Southeast.\n\ns_00510: We created species distribution models with the drought data to look at variable importance in dry years compared to variable importance for the whole study period (main training set).\n\ns_00560: An example of a successful public-private consortium that could be used as a model for new collaborations is the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) which played a key role in the identification and implementation of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials.\n\ns_00610: The group also found a positive correlation between age and expression of most viral genes including ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSL and CTSB at different stages of the menstrual cycle suggesting that older women may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 endometrial infection."
