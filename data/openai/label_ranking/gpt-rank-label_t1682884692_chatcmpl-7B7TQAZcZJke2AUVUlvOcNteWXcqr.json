The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00075: While the study collected surveys from more than 30,000 participants, data were not collected by the AAMC survey regarding the actual activities in which students engaged.\n\ns_00125: Previous research has demonstrated the importance of material resources for understanding the educational outcomes of teenage mothers and fathers (Mollborn, 2007), but more research is needed on measuring resources that adolescent fathers typically provide to children.\n\ns_00175: Figure 6 shows registration results for test subjects, illustrating the intensity heterogeneity present in these patients.\n\ns_00225: Given that the data were anonymized, public, and freely available, informed consents were not needed nor ethical committee approval.\n\ns_00272: The Swedish part of the study was approved by the local ethics committee, and the research at both sites was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration.\n\ns_00322: 58 This is one of the biggest studies on aging showing T levels decline in men and its relationship with several aspects related to aging 4 ( Table 2) .\n\ns_00372: Table 8 shows the potential reduction in N and P runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed for different adoption rates of WSIN technology, according to the assumptions described above with respect to the ''optimistic scenario.''\n\ns_00422: This technique depends on segmentation of high resolution structural MR data.\n\ns_00472: This is done with the conjunctive kernel of the DINA model, which is presented as a latent response vector ( below (Equation 1).\n\ns_00522: For the main datasets, model performance was not related to a species' prevalence according to Spearman's rank correlation (-0.09, p-value 0.62).\n\ns_00572: \u2022 Support completion of the initial goals of the BRAIN Initiative to ensure that the necessary tools and technologies are available to study normal and pathologic brain function, including fundamental understanding of neural-cell types and circuits.\n\ns_00622: However, low expression of ACE2, the major cell surface receptor used by SARS-Cov-2 does not exclude the risk of endometrial infection since other proteases like TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB and FURIN which show high expression during certain periods of the menstrual cycle.\n\ns_00664: Ffield [2007] observed that 68% of all WTNA category 5 TCs pass over the plume area and thus suggest circumstantial evidence of a relationship, assuming that the plume is responsible for warm SST anomalies.\n\ns_00714: all report benefit measures derived 4 Average state prices were used because county-level price data were from the revenue approach to be within 20 percent not available.\n\ns_00764: Using data from the new Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K:2011), our analysis provides first evidence on science achievement gaps in the first two grades of school.\n\ns_00814: Rorrer, Skrla and Scheurich (2008) have contended that the school district is an important agent for system change.\n\ns_00864: Likewise, Keeley and Bechard (2011) reported increased nest defense with consecutive human visits to nesting Ferruginous Hawks in New Mexico.\n\ns_00914: Generally speaking, the AD group and NC group were separated pretty well by all the models, our Deep Ordinal Ranking model captured the progressive patterns of the AD better than other models, as the larger coefficients of the confusion matrix located at the nearby positions along the diagonal of the matrix, indicating that misclassified subjects were assigned to adjacent categories in the progression spectrum, instead of the distant categories.\n\ns_00964: Thanks to the fact that the SSHA is less noisy 10 than SSTA, it is more clear the appearance of an oscillation on a period of about 20 days, whose nature remains unclear, but whose presence appears ubiquitous in our composite analysis.\n\ns_01014: It is foreseen to implement these in PMP.\n\ns_01064: A more comprehensive analysis reveals that the level of income and net worth and their distribution among households and across life-cycle stages may differ significantly across different types of households.\n\ns_01114: First, and similar to other emerging studies in the educational literature (Keys et al., 2013; McCoy, Connors, Morris, Yoshikawa, & Friedman-Krauss, 2015; Weiland, Ulvestad, Sachs, & Yoshikawa, 2013) , we found only small and either marginal or nonsignificant relations between the quality of teacherchild interactions and children's academic and behavioral outcomes for both age cohorts.\n\ns_01164: SHIPS is an empirical model that employs a multiple regression method to forecast intensity changes out to 120 h. The 2011 version of SHIPS includes 25 predictors, mostly related to atmospheric conditions (Mark DeMaria 2011, personal communication).\n\ns_01214: This has led to recommendations for selecting trials participants based on initial severity, which is usually based on scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [3] or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) [4] .\n\ns_01264: This is a challenge due to the lack of available and comparable data."
