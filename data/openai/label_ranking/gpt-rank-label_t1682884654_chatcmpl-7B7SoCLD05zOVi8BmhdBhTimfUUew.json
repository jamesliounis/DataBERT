The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00124: Because few past surveys have been able to capture large enough subsamples of teenage fathers and their children to allow for meaningful analysis, identifying these diverse experiences using recent nationally representative data is an important first step in directing future research.\n\ns_00174: We demonstrate our method on a clinically-acquired MRI dataset of stroke patients and on a simulated sparse MRI dataset.\n\ns_00224: These indicators' interpretation could be conditioned by variables such as demographic structure, socioeconomic status, or available health system resources.\n\ns_00271: The mean age of the participants was 62.7 years at baseline testing, which Values denote numbers with percentages in parentheses.\n\ns_00321: [73] [74] [75] The study paid particular attention to the effects of age-related sex hormones decline.\n\ns_00371: Assumed reductions in application rates for ''with WSIN'' conditions for both scenarios were estimated using results from Chappell et al.\n\ns_00421: [16] using white matter as reference region based on the same dataset.\n\ns_00471: The conjunctive kernel of the DINA model can be presented as below:\n, where is the latent variable which is coded as zero or one for respondent r and item i, and is the Q-matrix entry described above.\n\ns_00521: Bird occurrence data were obtained from 77 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes throughout the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.\n\ns_00571: For example, advanced tools to study the expression of genes in single cells were described last year and are already being applied to the analysis of diverse cell types in the brain, but the actual mapping of particular protein complexes-the intended targets of drugs-to particular neural cell types awaits further development.\n\ns_00621: To date, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on endometrial lining and implantation remains largely unknown, therefore the study by Henarejos-Castillo et al.\n\ns_00663: The annual and area mean TCHP in the model is 48.2 kJ/cm 2 .\n\ns_00713: Researchers have experimented chose the W126 model as the best for addressing with numerous ozone index designs including sea-plant exposure questions.\n\ns_00763: Consequently, there is a need to examine science achievement gaps utilizing data that more accurately reflects the current policy environment.\n\ns_00813: An LLP framework (Figure 1 ) was then developed to conceptualise the intervention.\n\ns_00863: In Nebraska, the number of fledglings produced in unfragmented rangeland was not significantly different from the number of fledglings produced in a mixture of rangeland and cropland (Podany, 1996) .\n\ns_00913: First, the current study focused on the hippocampus in AD diagnosis, and obtained similar classification performance as those methods based on the whole brain information (Liu et al., 2015b) .\n\ns_00963: The aim of this work is to perform the same type of analysis in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\ns_01013: Using this simplified model, some basic things such as evaporated propellant mass, pressurisation gas mass, ullage temperature and heat transfer between liquid and ullage could be compared.\n\ns_01063: Mean separation tests are also conducted for the three types of farm households and two types of nonfarm households, with these 5 types of households considered together ( Income and net worth exhibit patterns consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis.\n\ns_01113: As recently summarized by Burchinal (2017) , evidence suggests that associations between the CLASS and children's outcomes are modest and may be due to measurement challenges; although CLASS observers often score within one point of another, they rarely get closer (or an exact match), which is problematic because the standard deviation of the CLASS is often 0.50 points, which means that even small differences between raters are quite meaningful in terms of CLASS scores.\n\ns_01163: Although not as large as for the sample of category-5 hurricanes alone, this result indicates that the TCHP input has improved the operational SHIPS forecasts, especially at the longer forecast intervals (Goni et al.\n\ns_01213: However, the results of post hoc analyses have not been consistent across trials [5] .\n\ns_01263: Table 2 summarizes the positions adopted in agencies with respect to digital skilling and the measurement of digital literacy.\n\ns_01313: We obtained papers for this review using a four-step procedure."
