The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08135: Interpolation based on the data for 1700 and 1820.\n\ns_08185: These findings provide additional support for the large body of research that has found early childhood environments are critical in determining how effectively individuals can acquire human capital in the future.\n\ns_08235: We begin with one of the oldest and most successful efforts at improving calculus, the calculus program at the University of Michigan.\n\ns_08262: The 11 databases described below reflect data from different points in time for college students with disabilities.\n\ns_08312: As the ACAPS dataset records the dates of policy measures, modifications were directly made -if necessary -for measures www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ implemented between the two rounds of data verification.\n\ns_08362: Using a binomial test we compared the AD dataset with each of the iron phenotype datasets in turn examining 144 SNP subsets (testing twelve P value threshold combinations).\n\ns_08412: In section 2, we state that XMT-DBSCAN has two parameters: window size w and \u03d5 which is a threshold to identify core and border voxels (see (Ester et al., 1996) for more details).\n\ns_08462: Total costs for these studies are likely higher as they typically leverage infrastructure within the National Institutes of Health and participating academic institutions.\n\ns_08512: As was shown in section 3, while other datasets could in principle allow for this type of analysis, none are as complete or include the level of details existing in WIC 2015, and moreover they do not offer the same degree of consistency between countries and across time.\n\ns_08562: Replication in independent large samples will be important to confirm these findings.\n\ns_08612: Accordingly, we specified the model with interactions of provider type by urban-rural status.\n\ns_08662: Following this, a combined comparative assessment of science and mathematics, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) was conducted in 1994-1995 for students at various levels of pre-tertiary education.\n\ns_08712: Thus, all data (model-derived and observed) is analysed at the 0.1h (6 min) interval.\n\ns_08762: To account for the complex sampling design of the survey, the Rao-Scott Chi-Square test 20 (\u03c7 2 R-S )-a modified version of the chi-square test-was used.\n\ns_08812: Finally, though we explored the effect of four hyperparameters of the visualization method ( : , = : , = ) we did not conduct an exhaustive study on the impact of the learning rate and the number of epochs performed (correlated to the patience, the tolerance and the maximum number of epochs).\n\ns_08862: Moreover, in line with previous surveys (Stellinger and Winterbert, 2008) , a majority of our respondents were satisfied with how their life has turned out so far (57% were fairly or very satisfied, while only 18% were fairly or very 'dissatisfied').\n\ns_08912: But Connor and McCoy (1979) noticed that the z-values have a much larger range, from about 0.05 to about 1.0.\n\ns_08962: [4] Breakup of landfast sea ice in the North American Arctic has been studied mostly in the context of ice trafficability and offshore oil and gas development [e.g., Sackinger and Rogers, 1974;Spedding, 1983;Barry et al., 1979] or coastal dynamics [Short and Wiseman, 1975;Shapiro and Barnes, 1991].\n\ns_09012: These findings align with our guiding ecological, systems, organizational, and institutional theoretical frameworks [27] [28] [29] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .\n\ns_09062: Dvorak developed an empirical model to diagnose TC intensity based on cloud organization in the visible channel.\n\ns_09112: The baseline subjects that had all the clinical, APOE genotyping, FDG-PET imaging and MRI imaging data from the ADNI database comprised of a total of 242 individuals.\n\ns_09162: Statisticians sampled students by means of stratified systematic sampling with predetermined sampling rates that varied by student stratum, as described in appendix B of the NPSAS:12 data file documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014).\n\ns_09212: But, as discussed in Marra (2001), in the early years this survey evidence was biased against the transgenic crops.\n\ns_09262: There was large variability across age groups, with standard deviations ranging from 49.2% in group 1 to 74.2% of the median activity count in the group 3.\n\ns_09312: The study we describe below should give a first indication of whether the application of such a method could be developed further and studied in greater detail, for which the discerning effects should be significantly present."
