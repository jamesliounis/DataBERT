The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09558: First, by examining change across studies, we can effectively control for the nature of the samples used in existing longitudinal efforts and weight findings from larger samples more heavily.\n\ns_09608: Finally, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that high school boys' time spent on homework has a positive effect on the probability of attending college.\n\ns_09658: In our work, with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier [15] , our system achieved an average of 91.5% on six different classification tasks in our relatively large-sized ADNI2 baseline dataset (N = 201).\n\ns_09708: We used nationally representative longitudinal data to investigate whether sciencerelated career expectations of early adolescent students predicted the concentrations of their baccalaureate degrees earned years later.\n\ns_09758: Age, sex, and MMSE did not differ significantly between the 2 data sets as shown in Table 1 ; we propose DBN as the main deep model for feature learning in this study.\n\ns_09808: All problems assigned in this study were generated and modified from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) exams.\n\ns_09858: The Disease-Atlas was used to jointly forecast longitudinal observations of clinical scores and scan measurements, treating the transition to Alzheimer's Disease from either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Cognitively Normal (CN) states as our event of interest.\n\ns_09908: A useful way to think about this advantage is in terms of a multi-sector Ricardian model (see Dornbush et al, 1977) .\n\ns_09958: What we see at the high school level in Table 3 the variable representing the number of low-income students is inversely related to the dependent variable as before not at same strength but statistically significant.\n\ns_00010: This tab allows users to see the exact data that are associated with a publication or any other study.\n\ns_00060: By including CLRA, the analysis controls for laboratory research experience, allowing for a direct comparison of individuals reporting backgrounds with respect to HSSLRA and CLRA experiences from the four categories shown in Table 2 .\n\ns_00110: To retain as much data as possible for descriptive analyses, missing cases were deleted listwise within each individual bivariate comparison, resulting in varying Ns for each row of the tables.\n\ns_00160: In our experiments, we provide an analysis of this hyperparameter.\n\ns_00210: The search for additional indicators to illustrate both the recent and accumulated effect of infections has popularized internet pages such as Our World In Data (1) or Worldometer (2).\n\ns_00257: Multivariate regression analysis showed that both multidomain MCI (OR = 22.25, p = 0.001) and amnestic MCI (OR = 5.91, p = 0.001) were significant and strong predictors of dementia at follow-up.\n\ns_00307: The comparison of such kind of large cohort studies clearly remarks the great heterogeneity of outcomes, which differ for each study according to the peculiarity of the study design and the number and type of clinical and laboratory data collected.\n\ns_00357: \u2022 December 2013 23(6) Table 7 .\n\ns_00407: Here, we investigate the impact of 1) reference region selection; 2) correction for partial volume effects; and 3) choice of quantification technique using cross-sectional and longitudinal [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) imaging data from the DIAN study.\n\ns_00457: This study focused on the DINA model.\n\ns_00507: We created regional-scale SDMs for the U.S. PPR using Breeding Bird Survey occurrence records for 1971-2011 and wetland, upland, and climate variables.\n\ns_00557: Those growing success stories also reveal that the genetic analysis of brain disorders is scalable, and with appropriate organization and good policies (such as requirements for data-sharing within the bounds of protecting subject privacy) additional funding would efficiently advance the pace of discovery and thus accelerate investigations into disease mechanisms (Sekar et al., 2016) , the nomination of molecular targets for therapies, and the discovery of candidate biomarkers (Jack and Holtzman, 2013) .\n\ns_00607: In conclusion, existing evidence suggests that expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related genes varies with age and menstrual cycle phase, with ACE 2 expression increasing with female age.\n\ns_00649: The spatial distribution and magnitude is very similar to the model results ( Figure 5c).\n\ns_00699: Table 1 shows definitions and descriptive portant crops grown s n the region, and together statistics for variables used in the regression equaaccount for over one third of the value of all crops tn T dependent variable in both models, y\" is grown in the U.S. ($18.1 billion for corn, $11.0 corn or soybean yields measured in bushels per billion for soybeans).\n\ns_00749: In particular, we standardized the measures using sampling weights and survey settings to account for the complex sampling design of the ECLS-K:2011."
