The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00390: For example, growers considering shifting to WSIN will initially need access to consultants, extension agents, or other growers who are familiar with WSIN technologies to help them design and calibrate systems for their specific applications.\n\ns_00440: An IDAIF was obtained using a recently developed technique by combined analysis of TOF-MRA, T1-weighted MR, and dynamic PET imaging data [30, 34] .\n\ns_00490: General DCMs include the log-linear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM; Henson, Templin, & Willse, 2009) , the general diagnostic model (GDM; von Davier, 2005) , and the generalized DINA (G-DINA; de la Torre, 2011) model.\n\ns_00540: We created current and future predictive distribution maps for each species in ArcMap 10 based on an assignment of grid point locations as suitable or unsuitable.\n\ns_00590: The highly damaging effects of these conditions on individuals, families, and society have been well documented by studies of disease burden, direct costs of health care, and economic loss.\n\ns_00682: From the CFSR data it can be seen, that the mean sea level pressure over the WTNA varies between about 1012 hPa and 1018 hPa (not shown).\n\ns_00732: The variable RKLS measures the erodibility of 1989) rather than the W126 measure used here.\n\ns_00782: Estimates are adjusted to account for the complex sampling design of the ELCS-K:2011 using sample weights and Taylor linearized estimates of the standard errors.\n\ns_00832: The crisis is also confirmed by the results of both national and international evaluations.\n\ns_00882: In Idaho, Ferruginous Hawks readily nested in areas burned within the past 15 years, as well as in unburned areas (Lehman and others, 1996) .\n\ns_00932: The performance of the classification is evaluated with the following metrics: (1) normalized confusion matrix, (2) adjusted classification accuracy, (3) receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and area under ROC (AUC).\n\ns_00982: The composite averaged winter and summer SSHA from 90 days before the event to 180 days after are shown in figures 3a and 3b, respectively.\n\ns_01032: The PMP simulation results in a somewhat lower ullage temperature, which seems a bit strange because according to Figure 3 the heat transferred from the ullage into the liquid is less in case of PMP.\n\ns_01082: The life-cycle hypothesis is tested using regression analysis where the different stages of the lifecycle (ages 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, >65) are represented with dummy variables.\n\ns_01132: We also estimated models with quadratic terms included.\n\ns_01182: In this region, a well-mixed upper-ocean layer has proven to be a more effective means of assessing oceanic regimes for TC studies rather than SST fields alone.\n\ns_01232: The rate of change for each group would be the sum of the reference estimate (9.96 points/year for the most severe group) plus the estimate for the interaction, so that negative interaction terms indicate slower progression.\n\ns_01282: The WEF also release the Global Information Technology Report 2016 which detailed a Network Readiness Index.\n\ns_01332: We restricted our review to population-based studies, as studies of the life course of these disorders need to include the large number of individuals with significant symptoms who do not seek appropriate clinical care and who would be excluded from studies drawn only from clinical populations [20] .\n\ns_01382: 23 This suggests that results from previous studies, including studies on patients with psychosis, may not be generalizable, and so must be interpreted with caution.\n\ns_01432: The root-mean-square (rms) error,\nis calculated between the interpolated (T i int ) and original (T i ori ) SST of the validation dataset (called the interpolation error) to evaluate the quality of data interpolation.\n\ns_01482: The GAO report was prepared at the request of two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer of California and Ron Wyden of Oregon.\n\ns_01532: It predicts 11 layers of soil temperature and moisture (liquid or ice), fi ve layers of snow (mass, cover, and age), and a two-leaf (sunlit or shaded) canopy of temperature, radiation, and photosynthesis-stomatal resistance (Dai et al., 2003 (Dai et al., , 2004 .\n\ns_01582: Then, the validated models were applied to simulate hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses in six engineering conceptual plans to a hypothetical long-term hydrological forcing, a storm-monsoon event.\n\ns_01632: Amplicons were pooled and quantified with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay using the Qubit 3.0 instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA)."
