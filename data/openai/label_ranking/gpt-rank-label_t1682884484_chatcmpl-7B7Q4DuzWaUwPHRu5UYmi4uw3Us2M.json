The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09068: This kind of multi-panel display is used for a better analysis of the TC intensity, position, and structure.\n\ns_09118: As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.\n\ns_09168: As part of a longitudinal study, the BPS:12/17 student survey was developed using core data elements from previous BPS:12 data collections.\n\ns_09218: Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson (2000) modeled the change in welfare effects from adoption of Bt cotton and Roundup Ready soybeans using a basic two-region framework (US and rest of world [ROW]), based on the approach in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1998), in which the farm-level benefit is allowed to vary among US states, creating several subregions.\n\ns_09268: Previous research exploring the association between aging and activity has traditionally been limited to smaller samples, subjective assessment methods, or driven by activity-defined cutpoints (2, 6, (16) (17) (18) .\n\ns_09318: In order to investigate whether information about the difference between AD and NL could be derived from such a vector, we performed several experiments using automated vector classification methods.\n\ns_09368: Classification accuracy was evaluated on a standardized ADNI dataset comprising 818 1.5 T and 3 T scans from different subjects (229 controls, 401 MCI, 188 AD) using leave-one-out cross-validation.\n\ns_09418: However, whereas several previous studies adjudicated the presence and severity of AC from plain thoracic or lumbar radiographs 7, 12, 34-36, 38, 48 , we used a combination of CT scout images of the chest and CT slices of the upper and lower abdomen to generate a comprehensive severity score of AC.\n\ns_09468: A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for being included in the study.\n\ns_09518: In COVID-19, various clinical trials have outlined the role of corticosteroids such as one retrospective observational study revealed that 72% of ICU patients with COVID-19 are receiving glucocorticoids treatment [48] .\n\ns_09568: When the years of assessment were not available, we used estimates of the year of assessment on the basis of information in the article, such as year of publication.\n\ns_09618: More generally, these results contribute to the literature on gender gaps in non-cognitive skills.\n\ns_09668: And among all six experiments, the new method with whole cortical thickness at least achieved three best measures among all comparisons.\n\ns_09718: For example, a prototypical student expecting a science-related career has an estimated probability of obtaining a life science degree of 29% compared with 18% for a prototypical student expecting a nonscience career, with all other predictors set to the means.\n\ns_09768: In the classification experiment, 3 kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and radial basis) were used for detecting features' generalization ability and classification reliability.\n\ns_09818: The participants' responses were analyzed based on their success in solving the problem.\n\ns_09868: The Disease-Atlas captures the associations within the joint modeling framework, by learning shared representations between trajectories at different stages of the network, while retaining the same sub-model distributions captured by joint models.\n\ns_09918: The first two types of studies tend to find small wage effects (see Altonji and Card 1991, and Card 1990) .\n\ns_09968: For this study there are four major hypotheses as follows:\n1.\n\ns_00020: Still, the need to support heterogeneous studies, retrospective data, and other established repositories make it difficult to avoid duplication without either committing extensive resources to data migration or to require the community to adopt an established standard.\n\ns_00070: On the basis of Table 2 , we computed a new four-category variable for analysis based on reported participation: \"both HSSLRA and CLRA,\" \"only CLRA,\" \"only HSSLRA,\" and \"neither HSSLRA nor CLRA (no LRA).\"\n\ns_00120: In a review of the literature on low-income fathers, Nelson (2004) noted a need for more research about fathers' influences on their children's well-being.\n\ns_00170: Eleven of these improvements are statistically significant with p-values < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 with a paired t test and three of these improvements are statistically significant with p-values < 0.02.\n\ns_00220: In order to analyze these possible differences, we have scoped to draft a mortality profile of two South American countries that share, in addition to the same geographic region, other similarities such as the number of inhabitants: Argentina and Colombia.\n\ns_00267: Employing neuropsychological criteria, both Bozoki et al."
