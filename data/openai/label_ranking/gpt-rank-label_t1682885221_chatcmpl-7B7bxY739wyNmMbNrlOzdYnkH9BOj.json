The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08937: This suggests it will be hard to come up with rigorous scientific tests based on the concept of ''best fit to the data.''\n\ns_08987: However, among the 3 years of highest Figure 11.\n\ns_09037: Values greater than one for the SES and racial similarity ratios indicate, respectively, higher school-level concentrations of low SES students than neighborhood SES and higher school-level white composition than neighborhood white composition.\n\ns_09087: Soon after the first satellite weather observations became available, routine TC intensity studies from this imagery began [23] .\n\ns_09137: The geodesics emanating from this estimated atlas towards each subject are estimated by warping\u012a to each of the baseline subjects to give initial deformation momenta, \u03b1 i (0)(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N) [7] .\n\ns_09187: /data/source/bps17nsldsidrappl/b ps17nsldsidrappl_datafile.csv NSLDS FAFSA history Contains student award year-level data from FAFSA, stored and obtained from NSLDS, for approximately 19,250 matched study members as of early 2018.\n\ns_09237: They divided the world into consumers and producers of GM and nonGM canola and estimated the distribution of total surplus accruing to each group under various assumptions about the form of technical change, the incidence of identity preservation costs, and the impact of a technology fee.\n\ns_09287: The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a study of normative human aging, established in 1958 and conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program.\n\ns_09337: Therefore we tested three of them, viz.\n\ns_09387: This was done using linear regression against age on the healthy cohort, as depicted in Figs.\n\ns_09437: The interaction of each independent variable (BMI, body weight, body height, BMD) with age, gender and African American race was also included in the respective multivariate regression models, to test whether associations were consistent across race, gender and age groups.\n\ns_09487: On the same day, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\ns_09537: (2020) reported that intravenous injection of N-acetyl cysteine in small cases of COVID-19, demonstrated significantly decreased inflammation and clinical improvement along with markedly reduced CRP levels in all patients and ferritin in 9/10 patients [141] .\n\ns_09587: If a study contributed multiple effect sizes that were coded as measures of agreeableness and openness, then these effect sizes were aggregated into one estimate of change for agreeableness and one estimate of change for openness.\n\ns_09637: For example, Jacob (2002) used time spent on homework as a measure of non-cognitive skills and found that gender differences in non-cognitive skills had positive effects on college completion.\n\ns_09687: There has been a growing interest to apply computeraided diagnostic classification techniques to analyze cortical thickness features and diagnose different stages of AD and especially in preclinical individuals at high risk for AD to facilitate early interventions.\n\ns_09737: To the extent that taking courses encourages expectations, this result supports the National Science Board's contention (8) that mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 have an impact on the physical sciences and engineering workforce.\n\ns_09787: Experiments in the FDG-PET image database of 109 patients provided evidence to support 2 assertions: (1) The proposed method, which uses only features derived from a single FDG-PET modality, can be superior to existing methods that use multimodal features in the sMCI versus pMCI classification task; (2) the proposed network can learn the discriminant mode from the difference ROIs to obtain a more robust classifier with better discriminant performance.\n\ns_09837: Some studies reviewed here also examined students' problem-solving strategies.\n\ns_09887: For longitudinal predictions, we focus on both the Disease-Atlas and JM which are able to generate predictions at arbitrary time steps in the future.\n\ns_09937: 3 In this paper, then, we explore the implications of skilled emigration on the development of the software sectors in three emerging economiesIndia, Ireland, and Israel.\n\ns_09987: However, this speculative and warrant further research but I hypothesize a school dropout factor.\n\ns_00039: Although the amount of data in NDAR is just now reaching the point where it will be widely useful to the research community, the database has already been used to as a private collaboration space to allow a research team interested in Fragile X to assemble and analyze their data (Sansone et al.\n\ns_00089: This is explained in part by prior research that has found that secondary students' confidence for doing science increases after participation in OST research programs (Templin et al., 1999; Rohrbaugh and Corces, 2011) and science-focused activities (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011) .\n\ns_00139: The developmental outcomes measured in the ECLS-B data are based on 60 minutes of one-on-one assessment based on reputable and widely used assessment measures in child development, and they are intended to provide a reasonably comprehensive picture of each child's age-appropriate developmental progress."
