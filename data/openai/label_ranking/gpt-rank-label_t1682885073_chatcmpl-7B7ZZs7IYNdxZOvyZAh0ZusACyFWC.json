The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02507: In addition, as we were looking to analyze positive selection estimates over time, we required 200 samples per time point.\n\ns_02557: Wooldridge notes the procedure is very robust and can be applied when the y 2 contains binary, count, or other discrete variables.\n\ns_02607: The concentrations of glucose were determined, as well as total cholesterol (ChT), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TAG), by spectrophotometric method using reagent kits.\n\ns_02657: However, other studies found no association (Adler et al., 1997; Schommer et al., 1999; Ferguson, 2008) , or even an opposite link (Ballenger et al., 1983; LeBlanc and Ducharme, 2005) .\n\ns_02707: We begin by projecting the relative distributions of black and white family income, which are likely to converge somewhat in coming years.\n\ns_02757: In fact, documenting and understanding such subtle changes in land cover, including forest age, structure, and fragmentation as well as changes within particular land cover classes, will likely be as important as more obvious types of land cover change.\n\ns_02807: We analyzed scale scores, which estimated the number of items that a child would have answered correctly if they had been asked all of the scored questions (24) .\n\ns_02857: 2002; Hart and Risley 1995; Klebanov et al.\n\ns_02907: The COS collects information from businesses, however, which typically have greater Internet access and ability than individuals, and may therefore account for much of the difference (Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000;Sweet and Russell, 1996).\n\ns_02957: See appendix A for a more detailed &scission.\n\ns_03007: Of 32 teachers remaining after applying these criteria, 16 were involved in this study by random sampling and calculation of a representative sample (see Table 1 ).\n\ns_03057: The activities of daily living were more compromised in AD than MCI patients (p < 0.001, Supplementary Table 2) .\n\ns_03107: The estimated logit model can be used to identify and understand the impact of factors affecting choice of rice farms to engage in multifunctional activities, either because farm operators receive income or cost sharing from conservation programs or because farm operators receive income from conducting recreational activities or agritourism on the farm.\n\ns_03157: We use a unique dataset of transcripts of gram sabhas (village meetings) in South India to learn about the process of deliberation.\n\ns_03207: (Marc Sadler, personal communication, April 30, 2009.)\n\ns_03257: [Insert Table 4 about here]\n\ns_03307: The paper also shows that these results are robust to a battery of changes in the details of the specification and estimation, and to controls for other potential sources of differential effects related to individual banks' riskiness, size, direct exposure to Lehman Brothers, ownership, or specialization.\n\ns_03357: We took into consideration the disparities among countries by performing regional simulations using the best performing country in each index as the benchmark.\n\ns_03457: The evidence that is presented in this paper indicates that increased market contestability, as signi\u2026ed by low sunk costs, tends to reduce the dispersion of \u2026rm sizes.\n\ns_03507: From this construct emerges the basic proposition that the order of appearance of financial activities, which should reflect the intensity of the frictions to which they are exposed, should correlate with scale effects and the shape (convexity or concavity) of the development paths.\n\ns_03557: First, to alleviate concerns that the weakened association between productivity and exit is an artifact of the difficulties of measuring productivity during turbulent times Row A of Table 4 presents models which use deeper lags of value-added per worker and TFP as our productivity proxy.\n\ns_03607: We obtain similar results using the co-movement measure or the quantile betas described in Section 3.1.\n\ns_03657: In many of the importing countries (e.g., Brazil, the European Union, and the United States), China's share has more than doubled.\n\ns_03707: In Africa, for example, regional power trading could reduce energy costs by US$2 billion and carbon emissions by 70 million tons annually (Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia 2010) ."
