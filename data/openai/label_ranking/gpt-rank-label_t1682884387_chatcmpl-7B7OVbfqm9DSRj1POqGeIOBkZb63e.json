The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09166: Input from the study's expert Technical Review Panel (TRP), cognitive and usability testing (used to refine the survey questions, maximize the quality of data collected, and provide information on issues with important implications for the survey design), and findings from the BPS:12/17 pilot test helped finalize the full-scale data elements.\n\ns_09216: Sources examined fall into one of the following categories: field trials, farmer and consultant surveys, expert opinion and secondary data, and studies reporting ex ante estimates of economic impacts.\n\ns_09266: A similar analysis was performed to explore the association between functional status and daily activity counts.\n\ns_09316: In this work, we performed a study of the correlations of atrophy between the hippocampus and the ventricles for distinguishing AD patients from NL persons.\n\ns_09366: Whereas ADNI takes care of this aspect for the standardized dataset, we employ in our clinical settings automated image quality assessment (Mortamet et al., 2009) , artifact corrections and checkup for acquisition parameter compliance on the scanner console.\n\ns_09416: Though limited by the cross-sectional nature of the analysis, this methodology and the reduction in beta estimate we found in our cohort suggest possible causal pathways between variables 19 .\n\ns_09466: The cultures were harvested by scraping cell monolayers from at different time points (6, 12, 18, 24, 48 and 72 h) and stored at -80\u02daC.\n\ns_09516: Blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.\n\ns_09566: d These studies reported on five or more samples, so the aggregate N is provided.\n\ns_09616: Columns 2 through 5 of table 5 present estimates of the same interaction specification on different subsamples to further investigate potential sources of the gender gap in non-school study time.\n\ns_09666: Usually, several epochs are required to obtain a satisfactory result.\n\ns_09716: We therefore included four covariate groups to account for (i) academic backgrounds (science and mathematics achievement scores); (ii) students' demographics (gender and ethnicity); (iii) students' academic characteristics (enrollment in advanced versus regular mathematics and science classes, attendance in these classes, and studentreported attitudes toward mathematics and science); and (iv) parents' background (highest educational level and professional versus nonprofessional employment) (6).\n\ns_09766: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to validate the results.\n\ns_09816: Yin (2008) argued that a qualitative research design is used for in-depth investigation of the current situation in reallife contexts.\n\ns_09866: Observations were discretized to 6-month (or 0.5 year) intervals, and missing measurements were imputed using the previous value if present, and the population mean otherwise.\n\ns_09916: To examine how a connected diaspora might facilitate such business, we take the example of a US software firm looking to outsource a once-off software development project, with all the attendant difficulties modeled in the Grossman and Helpman paper referenced in the introduction.\n\ns_09966: The hypotheses are as follows:\n1.\n\ns_00018: NDAR has become the data repository that houses the data measured in the NIH Study of Normal Brain Development (Evans and the Brain Development Cooperative Group 2006).\n\ns_00068: All data were linked for individual PMQ respondents, with duplications removed and deidentified for analysis.\n\ns_00118: We conducted our own analyses comparing various groups of nonresponding fathers with respondents on three key sociodemographic measures from Wave 1 mother reports: child's household socioeconomic status (SES), father's years of education, and father's race (White vs. non-White).\n\ns_00168: This dataset has the advantages of having segmentations of 30 different structures in the brain obtained using FreeSurfer [19] .\n\ns_00218: In conclusion, any death rate comparison that is not sex or age adjusted might lead to a misrepresentation of the actual differences of the pandemic impact between countries.\n\ns_00265: Based on this analysis, independent variables were chosen to be tested in a multivariate logistic model.\n\ns_00315: This implies that the comparison of the results coming from different studies as well as the results of the same study obtained in different periods by using different assay methods remain challenging.\n\ns_00365: The magnitude of potential environmental benefits per region, and overall for the United States, are presented in Table 7 ."
