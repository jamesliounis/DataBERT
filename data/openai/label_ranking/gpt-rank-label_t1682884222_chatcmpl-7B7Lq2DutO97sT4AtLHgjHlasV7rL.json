The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05586: 2016-2035) and the baseline (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) for the particular return period and RCP scenarios.\n\ns_05636: Fuente: estimaciones por pareamiento por puntaje de propensi\u00f3n realizadas a partir de la informaci\u00f3n de la Encuesta de Evaluaci\u00f3n de los Hogares (ENCEL) 2017, complementada con informaci\u00f3n del panel ENCEL 1997-2000.\n\ns_05686: For full budget coverage, decentralizing the FMIS to all districts and lowest level spending units is often advocated, including in the 2016 FMIS diagnostic framework (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2016) .\n\ns_05736: Finally, using Sakernas information on the share of each occupation in total provinceindustry-year employment, we link the skill measures of each occupation obtained from STEP to the Sakernas database: *\n\ns_05786: We rely on three sources of data: baseline data, administrative data on payment and attendance, and follow-up data.\n\ns_05836: In a rare exception, a study for the eastern United States by Kaltenbaugh (2019) finds significant correlations between ground station measures of NO2 and Sentinel-5P's tropospheric NO2 measure.\n\ns_05886: 2 The database is a set of input-output tables covering 189 countries for the period 1990-2015, providing the largest coverage of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that we are aware of.\n\ns_05936: (2017) and who study imports of Turkey and Colombia respectively.\n\ns_05986: Those factors also reflect what the descriptive statistics show to be the main obstacles to owning an internet-enabled phone or using internet, as outlined in the data section above.\n\ns_06036: On top of questions FIN24, FIN37, and FIN38 (already discussed in the main text, sub-section 4.1), in this Appendix, we also used the following questions from Global Findex Data to help characterize basic relevant facts of HtM and non-HtM individuals:\n\ns_06086: We complement the study of returns that have already happened with data from hypothetical vignettes.\n\ns_06136: We report the results in Table A .15 in the Online Appendix, unconditional on return migration.\n\ns_06186: Prior work on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has tended to involve either observational data from phone surveys (Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) or online experiments (Palm et al., 2021) in isolation.\n\ns_06236: Section 2 describes the data we use.\n\ns_06286: In these two columns, we added an interaction term between treatment and a girl fixed effect.\n\ns_06336: In the Appendix, I report similar estimates (see Table A6 ) and maps (see Figure A5 and A6) at the district level, which corresponds to the finest administrative unit available in the data set.\n\ns_06386: See, for example, Conley (2004) .\n\ns_06436: The results from Table 2 are summarized and displayed in Figure  1 .\n\ns_06486: See Devarajan and Ianchovichina (2018) .\n\ns_06536: Considering the critiques of the earlier literature (Hogan et al., 1991) that TPOs' inefficiencies in the 1980s were explained by the fact that they were not sufficiently funded and too bureaucratic, these numbers suggest that TPOs in high-income countries may have overcome these problems to a larger extent than TPOs in low-income countries.\n\ns_06586: On the other hand, more sectorally disaggregated studies, such as those of Ahmad and Stern (1987) and Jha and Srinivasan (1989) for India, make strong macroeconomic assumptions, notably that of fixed factor prices.\n\ns_06636: The box below illustrates the added factors that come into play when considering integration in a transition environment.\n\ns_06686: Here, we follow the methodology of Cumby and Obstfeld (1983) to estimate the Central Bank sterilization reaction function, with consideration of the endogeneity problems.\n\ns_06736: On the other hand, using the same data and a different way of correcting for selectivity bias, Morduch (1998) finds that microcredit does not have a significant impact on consumption levels and therefore on income poverty.\n\ns_06786: 21 Our preferred estimates are those in the last column, where we control for any systematic country or product variation in preference (as well as for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity)."
