The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00513: The result, we believe, is that the likelihood of correctly documenting the presence of a species was comparable across species, routes, and survey years.\n\ns_00563: Our thesis is based on the conjunction of a growing worldwide societal burden of brain disorders with scientific opportunity driven by the maturing of neuroscience and related disciplines, by the recent and continuing emergence of relevant tools and technologies, and by the quality and number of personnel in the field.\n\ns_00613: The results of this study may not be generalizable to patients considering conception.\n\ns_00655: Satellite observed SSTs (Figure 3b) are produced daily by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) at the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) using optimal interpolation from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) Pathfinder Version 5 data [Reynolds et al., 2007].\n\ns_00705: .e c ble signs and are significant at the ten percent crops level, with most coefficients being significant at the five and one ercent level.TheR 2 is not very o The regression equations also provide evidence high (between 0.34 and 0.38) but this is not un-o t \u2022\u2022atv i oon \u2022 c usual for cross-sectional models.\n\ns_00755: Across numerous datasets, early academic achievement, particularly math achievement, has been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of later achievement (Duncan et al., 2007).\n\ns_00805: The presenters used protocols, for example, taking the participants down \"The ladder of inference\" in order to challenge assumptions that were placed at the top of the ladder.\n\ns_00855: In California, Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, the species preferred areas that had few perches; mean percentage of home ranges with no perches was 77.3 percent of 50 pairs (Janes, 1985) .\n\ns_00905: To boost the deep learning model's performance and robustness to image alignment and hippocampus segmentation errors, data augmentation is adopted to generate more training data (Goodfellow et al., 2016) .\n\ns_00955: Average KE appears to be stationary in ERA-Interim ( The presence of this spurious trend makes questionable to use the CCMP dataset for studying global and regional trends, at least in the Mediterranean region, despite having be used sometimes for this purpose in the recent past (e.g.\n\ns_01005: PMP including the new phase change model was compared to the EADS Astrium tool EUCES.\n\ns_01055: This study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the economic well-being between farm and nonfarm households, based on the type and life-cycle stages of the household.\n\ns_01105: Given the fairly strong correlation across these three domains (rs = 0.49-0.74), for our focal analyses, we focus on the overall CLASS score as an indicator of the quality of teacher-child interactions (\u03b1 = .80).\n\ns_01155: One of the critical areas to be addressed is to improve the understanding of the role that the ocean plays in TC intensity (Bender and Ginis 2000;Shay et al.\n\ns_01205: These analyses support prior observations that participants in AD clinical trials show different ADAS-Cog outcomes based on initial severity on the MMSE.\n\ns_01255: An important consideration is the need to ensure the data collection strategy, that informs the construction of the index, is based on representative sampling inclusive of all members of a country's population.\n\ns_01305: We identified potential studies for inclusion by querying all possible search fields for combinations of the following terms: 'anxiety', 'mood', 'disorder', 'heterogeneity', ' symptom', 'subtype', 'symptom subtype', 'trajectory', 'trajectories', 'depression', 'posttraumatic stress', 'PTSD', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', and 'ADHD'.\n\ns_01355: Using relatively large datasets of FEP patients, Vieira et al 45 reported lower classification accuracies than previous studies (between 50% and 70%), but also poor generalizability of models to other sites.\n\ns_01405: Thus, three datasets are available: raw dataset with missing records, interpolated dataset for the missing records (calculated by the iterative EOF method), and the reconstructed dataset which is the combination of the raw and interpolated data.\n\ns_01455: We hypothesize that subsequent application rates may reflect underlying gender differences in application propensity, similar to what another study found in Britain.\n\ns_01505: In the companion study (Liang et al., 2012a) , the redeveloped GOSSYM was used to study the responses of cotton growth to climatic stresses in the U.S. Cotton Belt and thereby to evaluate its ability to reproduce the observed cotton-climate relationships.\n\ns_01555: POM model (Blumberg and Meller, 1987) , SLOSH model (Jelesnianski et al., 1992; SLOSH, 2008) , SHORECIRC model (Svendsen et al., 2003ab) .\n\ns_01605: The information used for this study comes from secondary sources of data that were anonymized and do not represent a risk to the community.\n\ns_01655: The database should be accompanied by the framework necessary for carrying out objective and quantitative evaluation of different methods against ''gold standard'' expert annotations, including standards for reporting the results of those comparisons, and thereby facilitate an unbiased and transparent assessment of image analysis methods.\n\ns_01705: Despite these limitations, the use of SEER data to consider determinants of rare cutaneous malignancies has been validated in the literature."
