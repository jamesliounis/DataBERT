The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01783: We show that the proposed method has estimation and model selection consistency under both fixed-dimensional and high-dimensional settings.\n\ns_01833: The descriptive statistics and Moran's I values are shown in Table 1 .\n\ns_01883: Most descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using Student's t statistic.\n\ns_01933: The autopsy-related information is contained in two tables in the INDD.\n\ns_01983: A number of limitations are important to consider in the context of the current study.\n\ns_02033: The group learning for 2/3 years had a mean of 3.55 (SD = .89) in relation to progress while the group learning for 4/5 years had a mean of 4.1 (SD = 79).\n\ns_02083: In Table 4 , selected inhibitors for clinical evaluation of COVID-19 are listed.\n\ns_02133: Epidemiologic studies comparing the gastric cancer incidence in Asians and Asian immigrants to the USA support this transition [25, 26] .\n\ns_02183: This line of treatment and the robustness of the methodology and findings have also generated critical comments, see for example Grens (2020) .\n\ns_02266: A composite measure of frontal metabolism for each patient was created by averaging FDG-PET means across these regions.\n\ns_02316: Mean sea level today for their study site was determined using NOAA Tides & Currents adjustment values for Barnegat Inlet [Station 8533615;NOAA, 2015].\n\ns_02366: Covariates included age at baseline, sex, education, hyperglycemia status, ApoE e4 genotype, and mean MTL GM volume.\n\ns_02416: Observations and\n\ns_02466: Although this limits what we can say about the individual PCP, it may add to the evidence for the role of primary care in reducing costs related to LVC (or in reducing unnecessary care).\n\ns_02516: Combining CNN and FWuH sliding window estimates resulted in the strongest performance.\n\ns_02566: The most frequently consulted market information organizations were organic certification agencies (eight times per user per year), marketing cooperatives (10 times per year), and growers' associations (six times per year) (Walz, 2004) .\n\ns_02616: Those authors studied men living in Sweden who were diagnosed with BPH, and found that people with metabolic syndrome had increased prostate volume (49 mL) than patients with BPH and with no evidence of metabolic syndrome (28.5 mL).\n\ns_02666: (2017) S found that elevated cortisol (as measured by the urinary free cortisol/creatinine ratio) and elevated intra-subject cortisol variability (as measured by the within-person urinary free cortisol/creatinine ratio variability) were associated with a 1.31-and 1.38-times increase in AD risk.\n\ns_02716: Unfortunately, we lack data on family income in earlier years.\n\ns_02766: every 5 years) has been identified as an important component for assessing the state of Lake Superior and would also provide an international perspective of anthropogenic drivers likely to affect the health of various ecosystems across the Great Lakes basin, including Lake Superior (State of the Great Lakes, 2009).\n\ns_02816: Because the ECLS-B did not report normed scores, our primary analyses used children's scale scores.\n\ns_02866: 1978), which is a laboratory-based procedure, and the Attachment Q-Sort (AQS; Waters and Deane 1985) , which was developed as an alternative to the Strange Situation.\n\ns_02916: Research conducted by Abreu and Winters (1999) shows that it does, so we would recommend the use of priority mail in the future.\n\ns_02966: The stucknt data were used to construct SES if all comments based on parent data were missing and at least one component based on student data was not missing.\n\ns_03016: The research conditions, constraints and contextual factors that influenced teachers' perception of this innovation were identified."
