The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01224: Annual rate of change represents the slope of the mixed effects model fitted to the sample with the specified baseline MMSE range, while sample size is the number of subjects in the metadatabase with the specified baseline MMSE range Several previous studies have shown an association between more severe cognitive impairment and rate of decline, but there are inconsistencies among these reports.\n\ns_01274: These case studies assist to contextualize the approach of the study in terms of the socio-economic realities found in low/middle income countries, to which this study's recommendations apply.\n\ns_01324: The extant literature suggests that certain characteristics may predispose individuals to membership in more severe, versus less severe, longitudinal trajectories of depression.\n\ns_01374: 45 While the initial machine learning studies suggest that this approach holds some promise, they have involved relatively small groups of subjects.\n\ns_01424: Figure 4 shows the time series of raw, interpolated, and reconstructed data for SST anomaly at 132.2\u00b0E and 35.8\u00b0N; here the anomaly was obtained by subtracting an annual cycle of SST.\n\ns_01474: The difference was much larger at NIH (more than 20 percent) than at NSF (5 percent), and it applied to both successful and unsuccessful applicants in the first year.\n\ns_01524: When this information was not explicitly recorded, the irrigated area of cotton was estimated using the NASS Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) Census of Agriculture from 1984 from , 1988 from , 1994 from , 1998 from , and 2003 from .\n\ns_01574: By visually comparing the two figure measurements and simulations, the following common features on deposition and erosion are found:\n(1) The long-term morphodynamic simulations correctly reproduced the erosion and breaching that occurred in the river mouth bar;\n(2) The simulations produced a similar erosion pattern at the head of the Beiliao island, even though the computed erosions are underestimated; (3) The simulated sand depositions in the south bank of the river mouth show a consistent deposition pattern with the observations; (4) The morphodynamic simulations produced a similar offshore bar development; yet, the size of the simulated offshore bar is larger than the observations; and (5) The simulated morphological changes in the Touchien River show almost the same size and locations of deposition and erosion, e.g., the erosion at the left bank and the deposition at the right bank near the Jiugang Island.\n\ns_01624: Most of the NVs (92 out of 133) were unique to a sequence and among the shared NVs, 38 (out of 41) were associated with a specific lineage (Tables S2 and S3 ).\n\ns_01674: It would therefore be prudent to investigate alternative approaches; such approaches could be informed by a detailed analysis of the errors that occur when applying current methods to data already collected in longitudinal studies of MS.\n\ns_01724: Sex differences in DSS in adjusted models were statistically significant, with females suffering worse outcomes; comparatively, their male counterparts lived 1.39 years longer with adjustment for all other covariates for DSS.\n\ns_01774: However, Source 3 covariates could be incorporated as well, since they are relevant to the response variable.\n\ns_01824: Last, as the spatial filtering approach aims to remove spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable, we conducted Moran's I tests to assess if the residuals of these models are still Tables 2 and 3 indicated that spatial filtering effectively reduces spatial autocorrelation by approximately 85 percent from OLS models.\n\ns_01874: However, because the present study examined projected persistence and attainment rates and the methods used to analyze the data were basically descriptive in nature, this study can only suggest conclusions about actual attainment rates and persistence rates.\n\ns_01924: A genetics table with summary fields of gene sequencing results and SNP genotypes is available in the INQuery system to perform searches in combination with clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological features.\n\ns_01974: All participants involved in the current study were recruited via a social media campaign or via Prolific panel data, each of these options requires the participant (1) to opt in first of all and (2) have access to an internet connection and equipment to take the survey online.\n\ns_02024: The findings support the international evidence where correlation studies have suggested that children who experience musical training have advantages across all school subjects except sport even after general intelligence is controlled for (Wetter, Koerner & Schwaninger, 2009 ).\n\ns_02074: 15 In a genome-wide association study, SARS-CoV-2 was found to have a similarity of 79.5% in genomic sequence to the SARS coronavirus and to be 96% homologous to that of a bat-derived coronavirus, suggesting that bats are the main source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_02124: The intestinal subtype was relatively more common in Central America (64.3 %) but less so in US Hispanics (30.5 %), with the caveat that about 50 % of the data from the registries did not report the Lauren classification.\n\ns_02174: Keeping in view the research activity in this area started primarily with the outbreak of this disease, impact captured through citations would not give a correct picture as citations takes time to accrue.\n\ns_02257: However, although more WMHs were negatively associated with frontal metabolism, more WMHs were positively associated with glucose metabolism in the temporoparietal regions in both the larger study group (model 3 coefficient, 0.051; P = .001) and the CSF-A\u03b2 restricted group (model 4 coefficient, 0.023; P = .14) ( Table 3) .\n\ns_02307: Present-day 2016 sea level is an estimate of +10 cm (4 inches) over that datum, based on an estimated 4 mm/y sea level rise rate inferred from the historical data at New York City (The Battery, a NOAA tide gauge).\n\ns_02357: Diagnostic groups did not differ by age, sex, or education ( Table 1) .\n\ns_02457: Lastly, to check whether the findings for the high LVC group using the logit model were robust to the per-patient LVC spending thresholds, we varied the threshold from the top 30 th to 10 th percentiles in increments of 5 in defining the high LVC spending group."
