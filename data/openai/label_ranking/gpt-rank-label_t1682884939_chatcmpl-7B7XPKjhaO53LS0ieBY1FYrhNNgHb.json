The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06153: We find a correlation coefficient of 0.042 with an associated P-value of 0.787.\n\ns_06203: As mentioned in the preceding subsections, the phone survey was designed with the intention of household weights being used based on the 2016-18 DHS, which would allow for representative analysis at the household level about a range of COVID-19 related topics.\n\ns_06253: 3 For most countries, the distributions use micro data from nationally representative household surveys.\n\ns_06303: ddewalque@worldbank.org 2 France Strat\u00e9gie, mavridis.dimitris@gmail.com\n\ns_06353: Column (2) gives the number of observations used to estimate the country-specific IGM statistics (children whose parental education is reported in the censuses).\n\ns_06403: The authors may be contacted at fshilpi@worldbank.org.\n\ns_06453: The results in Figure 1 show interesting trends, that plausibly reflects the dynamic responses of various users to the effects of the pandemic.\n\ns_06503: These can be observed in table C1 in Annex C. Brazil, Mexico and Guatemala are the countries with statistically significant country fixed effects for all three categories of political participation analyzed.\n\ns_06553: Combining the information on budgets and number of employees, we find that the differences across TPOs in terms of budget per employee are large but not as striking.\n\ns_06603: i 8 The derivation appears inKubo, Robinson, and Syrquin (1986).\n\ns_06653: 2.12 The rationale for bringing together banking, securities, and insurance regulation within a single organization has been most fully explored by the Norwegian Royal Commission which reported in 1985.3 Its conclusions have been endorsed, at least implicitly, by the other Scandinavian countries that have established IFSSAs.\n\ns_06703: Note: **: Significant at 5 %, * :Significant at 10 % .\n\ns_06753: The process of trial and error included combining males and females in the same credit group and then changing this to separate groups divided by gender.\n\ns_06803: In order to correct for this potential heteroskedasticity problem, we follow a parametric correction suggested by Dickens (1990) .\n\ns_06853: 18 Note: There is a special issue of the journal World Development, Volume 29, No.\n\ns_06903: Furthermore, recent research (reviewed later) points to significant socioeconomic differentials in mortality and fertility; in particular, both birth rates and death rates tend to be higher for the poor.\n\ns_06953: The empirical results are based on a rich teacher-student matched data set from Zambia that we collected in 2002.\n\ns_07003: One would ideally like to match a participant with a non-participant using the entire dimension of observable attributes X-i.e., a match occurs if there are two individuals, one in each of the two samples, for whom the values in X are identical (Jalan and Ravallion 1999) .\n\ns_07053: In the medium to long run, this and other WTO decisions against Argentina's safeguard measures has led the business community to rely more on the antidumping mechanism (Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat 2005) .\n\ns_07103: If confirmed, this a sobering finding from the viewpoint of reducing inter-regional inequalities.\n\ns_07153: Panel B shows summary statistics of und holdings by country.\n\ns_07203: We then discarded from the sample of unconditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was below the 10 th percentile of the sample of conditioned households; similarly, we discarded from the sample of conditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was above the 90 th percentile of the sample of unconditioned households.\n\ns_07253: If we use the 2004 EBRD index instead of the average over time, the same finding obtains.\n\ns_07303: To examine this possibility, we estimated the same FE specification but replaced the PC terms with PC,+j, j=l, 2, 3, 4, which is one if a PC was observed to be in place j years ago (see table 3 ).\n\ns_07353: It will facilitate the sharing of this entered information electronically by the Government, thereby (a) eliminating the need for multiple, often duplicative requests for information and the associated time and resources; (b) increasing the speed and accuracy of the disposition of regulatory functions, and (c) reducing opportunities for unofficial charges."
