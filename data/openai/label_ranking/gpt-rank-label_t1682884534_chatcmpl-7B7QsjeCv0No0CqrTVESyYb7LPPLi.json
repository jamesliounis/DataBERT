The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05243: Most of the data on WSS focus on expenditures and derive consumption from some assumption of the pricing structure even when there are various pricing options.\n\ns_05293: Besides, empirical results from PARE (Lopez-Acevedo, 1999c ) indicate that intervention programs like it have produced rates of improvement among children with initially low learning achievement (specifically, indigenous students) that were remarkably higher than the average student.\n\ns_05343: Interestingly, the Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Kamin and von Kleist (1999) studies include data only up to 1997 (before the crises) while the Herrera and letters of credit for domestic exporters and importers, isolating the country from international capital markets.\n\ns_05393: Analysis of rapid consumption survey data requires high capacity.\n\ns_05443: Finally, we obtain data on several key country-level economic variables for evaluating the impacts of FDI, including, for example, productivity, employment, wages, and exports.\n\ns_05493: The study also includes data on billing and payment methods and redress mechanisms such as the availability of smart meters and consumption benchmarking.\n\ns_05543: Since the results are very similar to those that mimic the O*NET, we do not report them, but they are available from the authors upon request.\n\ns_05593: The counts of these and potential affected users within each PGA and liquefaction susceptibility class are presented in Tables 1 and 2 .\n\ns_05643: Nivel de significancia *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.Fuente: estimaciones por pareamiento por puntaje de propensi\u00f3n realizadas a partir de la informaci\u00f3n de la Encuesta de Evaluaci\u00f3n de los Hogares (ENCEL) 2017, complementada con informaci\u00f3n del panel ENCEL 1997-2000.\n\ns_05693: Last, the paper proposes an innovative deployment strategy for a budget execution system that would facilitate both good control and flexibility.\n\ns_05743: Our findings can be summarized as follows.\n\ns_05793: Finally, Columns (6) and (7) present the correlates for paying for the course in the TIOLI sample.\n\ns_05843: Use of the three information sources does involve trade-offs in the dimensions of spatial resolution, update frequency and cost.\n\ns_05893: A key component of the analysis in this paper is the estimation of a model of upstream and downstream linkages of economies across manufacturing GVCs by categories of natural resource endowment.\n\ns_05943: This implies that in a month, there are several transactions of similar characteristics with a different tariff rate and we need to define a product and its related price that can be tracked over time in order to conduct panel estimation with a monthly series.\n\ns_05993: Education, employment status, and type of electricity are found to be important factors (Aker and Mbiti 2010; Bj\u00f6rkegren 2019; Forenbacher et al.\n\ns_06043: Subsections 3.1 to 3.5 present the model.\n\ns_06093: An expansive literature on temporary (voluntary) migration has shown that ignoring this selection can distort the assessment of migrants' assimilation profiles and, by corollary, their economic impact.\n\ns_06143: We further corroborate this evidence in Panel B, where we present a scatter plot on the relationship between oil prices and the share of illegal migrants from the 1960s to 2010.\n\ns_06193: The results were weighted to match the general population based on the most recent nationally representative survey that included a measure of household welfare, which is the 2016-18 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).\n\ns_06243: First, we follow an approach similar to how we have updated the higher lines by replicating the methodology used to determine these values except now using the 2017 PPPs and more recent data.\n\ns_06293: In this section, we analyze whether the program had heterogeneous effects by child ability.\n\ns_06343: (2021) allow regional comparison but pooling together estimates generated with retrospective information and those with coresident samples, which may be problematic (seeMunoz & Siravegna, 2021).\n\ns_06393: The focus of the analysis is the parameter \u03b2 which is known as intergenerational regression coecient (IGRC, for short) in the literature.\n\ns_06443: Abbas, J., Mubeen, R., Iorember, P.
