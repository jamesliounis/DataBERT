The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01412: Subtraction of annual SST fields and 400-day moving-average were performed, and then the reconstructed SSTA dataset was established.\n\ns_01462: According to the report, there were no gender differences in federal spending at the science foundation or the Agriculture Department over the three-year period on which the study is based.\n\ns_01512: Model evaluation, while critical, has been limited and most oft en subjective, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive observations and coupled predictive systems (Th orp et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2008) .\n\ns_01562: Hence, in terms of the integration numerical modeling and practical engineering knowledge on hydrological, morphological, meteorological, and geomorphic conditions, this study demonstrates a general procedure to achieve the best coastal/estuarine planning against flood and erosion.\n\ns_01612: Our study provided evidence that an important number of independent introductions occurred to Colombia with at least 12 lineages documented.\n\ns_01662: For both these issues, challenges remain, and solving both might be facilitated by the standardized test dataset discussed under recommendation (3).\n\ns_01712: The SEER database search yielded 113 patients with granular cell tumors from 1973 to 2013, of which 82 patients (72.6%) presented with tumors on the cutis or subcutis.\n\ns_01762: The proposed method is more powerful in variable selection than other methods under the high-dimensional situations, as its FNR+FPR is the smallest among all the methods, as indicated in Table 2 .\n\ns_01812: After examining these eigenvectors (results not shown but available upon request), a fourth observation from our analysis is that the first four most important eigenvectors were the same across race/ethnic groups and they are eigenvectors 1, 6, 15, and 19.\n\ns_01862: This matrix can be used by most statistical software packages as the input data for least-squares regression.\n\ns_01912: The availability of frozen and fixed sections for each case is recorded in the tissue tracking table (Table EA3 ).\n\ns_01962: Table 4 displays summary statistics regarding keyworker classification for the entire sample (N = 1989) and by each nation.\n\ns_02012: A multiple regression to establish the extent of the impact of playing an instrument on attainment revealed a multiple R of .71 with an adjusted R 2 of .5 (F (2,599) = 300.93, p < .0001).\n\ns_02062: There are more than 30 registered randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib for COVID-19 treatment (e.g., N C T 0 4 4 2 1 0 2 7 , N C T 0 4 3 9 0 4 6 4 , N C T 0 4 3 3 4 0 4 4 , NCT04362137).\n\ns_02112: The demographic variables (age, gender, ethnic group, year of diagnosis, residency setting rural/urban) and two pathological variables (anatomical subsite and histological type) were recorded.\n\ns_02162: The table provides a broad indication of intensity of research happening in different fields.\n\ns_02212: Our work signals the importance of differentiating language from culture in intervention development for older, primarily Spanishspeaking Latinas/os with high medical comorbidity.\n\ns_02245: In other words, the study findings may more accurately reflect the underlying relationships of these associations based on changes occurring with progressive white matter disease and its metabolic effects over time.\n\ns_02295: Computer modeling was made possible, in part, by a grant of computer time from the City University of New York High Performance Computing Center under NSF Grants CNS-0855217, CNS-0958379 and ACI-1126113.\n\ns_02345: ROIs were selected based on previous studies examining progressive hypometabolism across the temporal progression of AD (31, 32) or areas where glucose metabolism has been associated with IR (18) .\n\ns_02445: Studies select specific LVC services based on generally accepted guidelines, such as Choosing Wisely and the United States Preventive Services Task Force.\n\ns_02495: We retained 66,495 samples in our final analysis.\n\ns_02545: The results for the quantile regression and the negative binomial model are shown in Table 2 .\n\ns_02595: A study conducted on the animal model by Vignozzi et al."
