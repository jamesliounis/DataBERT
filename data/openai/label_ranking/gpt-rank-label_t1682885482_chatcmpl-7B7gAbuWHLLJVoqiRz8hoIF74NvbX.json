The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08066: As shown in Figure 4 , they are in the range of 2 to 4 Euros for households in the bottom three deciles, while high income households pay a higher average tariff than the costrecovery level on their total electricity consumption (Appendix Table 2 ).\n\ns_08116: In the Latin American context of the late 1980s and 1990s, this means that infrastructure cuts in low-debt Colombia were 80 percent effective at enhancing solvency, whereas in high-debt Bolivia, their effectiveness was only around 20 percent.\n\ns_08166: This is based onMaddison's (1998, p.12) assumed subsistence minimum.\n\ns_08216: 4 ) But for the many high school graduates who are not well-prepared to attend college, and who thus may choose not to enroll, this subsidy is likely of little value.\n\ns_08293: However, there are significant gaps in the size and scope of disability-related data that is gathered.\n\ns_08343: The first eleven measures were manually coded from the ACAPS dataset.\n\ns_08393: CHARGE was partly supported by the NIH/NIA grant R01 AG033193 and the NIA AG081220 and AGES contract N01-AG-12100, the NHLBI grant R01 HL105756, the Icelandic Heart Association, and the Erasmus Medical Centre and Erasmus University.\n\ns_08443: I(v i jk \u2208 S r p ) is the intensity of voxel v i jk from subject p in population r and P s (v i jk , R q ) is the probability that voxel v i jk belongs to region R q in population s. \u03b1(p, r) and \u03b2(q, s) are indexation functions given by\nrespectively.\n\ns_08493: For example, with an anti-Ab antibody-based therapy, a decrease in brain amyloid tracer retention with an Ab antibody therapy would indicate target engagement and thereby justify further trials.\n\ns_08543: For the first type, we focus on three main data sources, IPUMS, NSO, and UIS.\n\ns_08593: An initial analysis of applying SVM with a radial basis function kernel to the same data yielded comparable or less accurate results, and these nonlinear models were much harder to interpret.\n\ns_08643: To enhance policymakers' and payers' ability to more effectively and efficiently increase office-based physicians' appropriate use of buprenorphine, we need more research to better understand the complex influences on waivered physicians' decisions regarding the number of patients to treat with buprenorphine, as well as the factors that help physicians do so safely and effectively.\n\ns_08693: Based on this perspective of the educational process, TIMSS assessed, through context questionnaires, factors such as national and school context, classroom characteristics, teachers, curriculum and student characteristics that are likely to influence students' learning of mathematics and the sciences.\n\ns_08743: The authors' NOS challenge was to develop and apply a robust and pragmatic set of standard analysis and metrics to quantitatively assess the performance of an operational ocean forecast system in a simple but meaningful way that relates to the purpose for which the system was developed.\n\ns_08793: Consistent with prior literature, as education increased, so did rates of participation, opportunity, and willingness.\n\ns_08843: This could mean that the regions on which the CNN relies on to identify the diagnosis mainly depend on the initialization and the training process and that the CNN training is not robust towards the regions identified.\n\ns_08893: Questions of choice and agency also emerge in research that focuses on how the neoliberal paradigm-which has come to dominate many developed countries in recent decades-affects people's lives, values and beliefs (Jeffrey and Mcdowell, 2004) .\n\ns_08943: lognormal distributions of abundance (Preston 1948 , Whittaker 1965 , body size Brown 1988, Brown and Nicoletto 1991) , and size of geographic range (Pagel et al.\n\ns_08993: The nearshore environment allowed us to observe the transition from the commonly acknowledged preferential melt of melt ponds on a single piece of ice to agglomerates of ice floes with significantly larger cumulative perimeter, marking the beginning of a nonlinear, catastrophic disintegration of landfast ice driven by both lateral, top and bottom ablation.\n\ns_09043: These patterns appear to coincide with the finding that U.S. public schools have, on average, higher nonwhite composition [37] than their surrounding neighborhoods, which may be attributed to the flight of white families from public schools.\n\ns_09093: A more detailed discussion about the utility of microwave imagers indicated that despite the ability to create the PMW-derived physical quantities (e.g., sea surface wind magnitude, precipitable water, and cloud liquid water) using multiple frequencies which utilize different spatial resolutions, they smooth over important structural features of the TC [59] .\n\ns_09143: We observed that the shape component dominated the model with up to 80% contribution compared to only 20% contribution from the PET component, irrespective of the classifier used.\n\ns_09193: Table D-1 provides a list of the data elements by section and topic.\n\ns_09243: The average per-acre profit measures for each state unambiguously favor the RR cotton varieties over conventional varieties in the four states for which we have data.\n\ns_09293: This study has several potential limitations."
