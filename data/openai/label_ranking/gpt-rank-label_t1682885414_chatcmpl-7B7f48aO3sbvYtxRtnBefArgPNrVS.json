The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09141: To extract the anatomical shape features, the unbiased atlas,\u012a is constructed from the preprocessed baseline MR brain images on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) [6] .\n\ns_09191: NCES Statistical Standard 4-4-3A states: \"For an item with a low total response rate, respondents and nonrespondents can be compared on sampling frame and/or questionnaire variables for which data on respondents and nonrespondents are available.\n\ns_09241: The impressive rates of adoption for many of these transgenic crops are strong evidence of their perceived value to farmers.\n\ns_09291: Although traditional subjective activity measurement tools may be easily administered and are generally inexpensive, they provide broad estimates of easily recalled activities of mostly medium-to-high intensity (8) .\n\ns_09341: We implemented the enhanced Graphical User Interface in Matlab.\n\ns_09391: As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.\n\ns_09441: Our findings extend this observation and suggest that the same hypothesis applies to AC.\n\ns_09491: In addition, analysis of the NP partial gene sequences of the Iranian samples in GISAID showed that all of the Iranian partial sequences (n = 15) also contain the T28688C, which is another key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of this clade.\n\ns_09541: Such as in reducing risk of common cold, vitamin D employs three different categories of mechanisms: physical barrier, cellular natural immunity, and adaptive immunity [119, 120] .\n\ns_09591: Interjudge reliability, indexed by the intraclass correlation, was quite high across the whole database (r \u03ed .93).\n\ns_09641: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\n\ns_09691: Sparse coding and dictionary learning has been successful in many image processing tasks as it can concisely model natural image patches.\n\ns_09741: For example, students with stronger performance in science and mathematics may be more likely to major in the sciences.\n\ns_09791: Effectively visualizing or interpreting the representation of potential features is a major challenge that needs to be addressed by both machine learning and the clinical neuroscience community.\n\ns_09841: Analysis of the collected data also demonstrated that although some of pre-service teachers attempted to use other strategies such as \"make a drawing,\" they failed to reach the correct answer.\n\ns_09891: This could reduce errors in cases where multiple sample rates exist and simple imputation is used, which might result in the multioutput networks replicating the imputation process instead of making true predictions.\n\ns_09941: We aim for a broad coverage of the effects of home country residents, which we discuss under four headings.\n\ns_09991: The sample is the highest 25 highest paying school districts.\n\ns_00043: When certain data collection instruments have become widely used in the field, we will explore the creation of a more formal lexicon.\n\ns_00093: (2016) further indicated that families with higher parental education have a greater likelihood of participating in OST science, which then associated with an earlier initial interest in science.\n\ns_00143: Before discussing findings for each of these in turn, we begin by describing differences between the two groups for sociodemographic variables.\n\ns_00193: The number of slices deleted was chosen to emulate the wide spacing in the clinically acquired stroke dataset.\n\ns_00243: The difference in fatality between Argentina and Colombia is 0.75 points per thousand.\n\ns_00290: Several studies have shown that the rate of progression is likely to be more rapid with greater neuropsychological impairment at baseline [6, 7] .\n\ns_00340: Even though the comparison among all these studies goes beyond the aim of this review, we will try to report in a critical fashion the aspects that are more relevant for the comprehension of the relationship between sex hormones and aging in males."
