The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08406: Table 1 summarizes some clinical and demographic information in each group.\n\ns_08456: However, current clinical trials designs have involved treatment of patients with AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment over generally 18 month to 4 year intervals (Schneider and Sano, 2009) .\n\ns_08506: For the latter, after mentioning the most important efforts, we concentrate the comparison on the most widely used and referenced ones, the Barro and Lee dataset (2013) and de la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2012) .\n\ns_08556: This work was focused on sparse linear classifiers applied to the simple concatenation of multi-modal data, since our major goal was to yield easily interpretable models while maintaining high predictive power.\n\ns_08606: The number of urban 30-patientwaivered physicians per capita was significantly associated with more buprenorphine being dispensed in 2006 (p < 0.01) and with modest reductions in buprenorphine per capita dispensed in 2009-2011 (p < 0.05 in each year) ( Table 3).\n\ns_08656: The performance of all the students in all the countries that participated in TIMSS-2003 was taken into account when defining these benchmarks, which are described as follows: See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of characteristics of the international benchmarks of science and mathematics.\n\ns_08706: The authors use mean error, variance (ie, standard deviation), and skewness (actually, positive and negative outlier frequency).\n\ns_08756: Table 4 shows the results of the multinomial logistic regression model for willingness to participate in health research.\n\ns_08806: This indicates that the impact of the distribution of the data between training and validation is minimal compared to the initialization of the CNN and the training process.\n\ns_08856: Galland's analysis (2008) , meanwhile, highlights that levels of youth optimism vary considerably across countries, and posits that this optimism should be interpreted in light of current socio-economic conditions, historical legacies, welfare regimes and cultural characteristics.\n\ns_08906: For example, Rosenzweig (1995) has made considerable progress by combining techniques one and three and examining different temporal scales over which parameters show a regular pattern.\n\ns_08956: In line with past studies [e.g., Reimnitz et al., 1994;George et al., 2004] we consider landfast ice as an aggregate of grounded pressure ridges and attached shoreward level and rubble ice (\"nearshore ice\"; see Figure 2).\n\ns_09006: Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for each study variable.\n\ns_09056: Section 8 presents a brief summary of history, applications, and impacts of satellite remote sensing on TC structure, intensity, forecast, and monitoring.\n\ns_09106: To make pattern analysis robust, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction to represent this high-dimensional data in terms of a few features, specifically selected to best explain factors relevant to dementia.\n\ns_09156: Table 62 details the code for analyses using the cross-sectional weight, and table 63 shows the code for analyses using the panel weight.\n\ns_09206: Burton, James, Lindner, and Pluske (2000), using the same methodology as most of the other aggregate studies, considered the effects of various identity preservation schemes on the total and distributional aspects of the benefits from adoption of genetically modified (GM) canola.\n\ns_09256: This allows for superior visualization and exploration of the association between age and activity, while minimizing the loss of information that results from using activity cutpoints.\n\ns_09306: As shown in Table 2 , the scale of the features will largely affect the accuracy.\n\ns_09356: Among the MCI subjects present in the analysis dataset, we know from subsequent visits that some were later diagnosed AD in the course of the ADNI study.\n\ns_09406: In multivariate ordered logistic analysis ( Table S2 ).\n\ns_09456: The significance level was set as a p value of less than 0.05 where \ufffd p<0.05.\n\ns_09506: A study involving a mice model of adenovirus mediated human ACE2 expression showed enhanced production of insulin along with decreased apoptosis of pancreatic islets [96] .\n\ns_09556: According to their interpretation of the data, there is evidence for increases in social dominance and decreases in social vitality, as Helson and Kwan (2000) proposed.\n\ns_09606: The current study uses time diary data from the American Time Use Survey ( conditioning on spending at least some time on homework."
