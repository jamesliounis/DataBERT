The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06885: aggregate time series or cross-sectional regressions have the potential to reveal the more subtle indirect effects of demographic change, this approach brings its own problems.\n\ns_06935: More traditional regression-based studies also validate this finding.\n\ns_06985: where D i * is household i's net benefit from moving, S i represents savings behavior, H i is a vector of household characteristics, DU i is a vector of dwelling unit characteristics that influence the household's decision, and \u03b5 i is a normally-distributed error term with mean zero and variance \u03c3.\n\ns_07035: The process that was triggered by the trade liberalization program is presented in Graph III.1, which shows total imports of footwear and footwear parts.\n\ns_07085: Revista Econ\u00f4mica do Nordeste, Fortaleza, v.32, N.ESP., p.524-545, 2001 .\n\ns_07135: Panel A of this table shows results for OLS regressions with robust errors for all ADRs and listed ADRs, while Panel B provides the Tobit regression results in which the dependent variable is constrained to lie between -1 and +1.\n\ns_07185: National identification numbers of respondents and other adults in the household were collected in the baseline and follow-up surveys, and the private banks in Banred provided data on the payments made to all persons with these identification numbers, on a monthly basis.\n\ns_07235: Table 6 ranks countries -not groups -according to their GATS commitment index and reports their most recent EBRD index score as well as the average EBRD score for the period as a whole (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) .\n\ns_07285: Rows under \"OLS, pooled\" relate to OLS(l) above, and \"FE, pooled\" FE(2) above:\n\ns_07335: Examples of objectives are listed in the Annex Table below.\n\ns_07385: The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_07435: This paper evaluates the effect these initiatives had on recipient countries based on data accumulated during 1989-93.\n\ns_07485: 22 Table 2 in A.
