The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04215: To establish for instance that dfih/dC < 0, note first that sg [dnh] rsg hnhC 1dCj\n\ns_04265: To see this consider another country k with which j has a lot of interaction-trade or capital flows or joint ventures-and mutual gain.\n\ns_04315: For instance, the USA and India have had significant domestic oil production, which accounted for 46.8% and 38.6% respectively of domestic consumption throughout the sample period.\n\ns_04365: Use\u03b2 1,j and an initial guess for\u03b2 0 0 , the coefficients on observable school-level characteristics, to construct the instrumented enrollment shares\u03c3 m j,t\n\ns_04415: We thank A. Sapir for providing data.\n\ns_04465: We also see that migrants with children in the Philippines are more likely to sign up for this product, whereas those with lower incomes are less likely to use the product.\n\ns_04515: We add this measure of competition as an additional control variable to the set of variables included in the regression specification that was presented in Table 6 .\n\ns_04565: This is not a trivial comparison: dietary risks are estimated to have accounted for more deaths worldwide in 2010 than alcohol and tobacco combined (Lim et al., 2014) .\n\ns_04615: (1) by including the underlying elements of speci\u2026cations (2) and 3:\n\ns_04665: Any improvement in the index can be attributed either to an increase in the coverage rate, (scale effect), or a reduction in the index of inequality of opportunity, D (distributional effect):\n\ns_04715: The ED measure developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998) is based on a sample of large U.S. companies, which are likely to have activities abroad.\n\ns_04765: For those in generation II, we have information on the value of all assets (including land) brought into the marriage, access to an individual bank account, spending on education for each co-resident child, and the survival status or year of death of each parent.\n\ns_04815: As in the complementary work of Jeong and Townsend (2000), we restrict attention to relatively young households, aged 20-29, whose current assets might be regarded somewhat exogenous to their recent choice of occupation.\n\ns_04865: Of course there may be interrelationships within the social and public good spending components making them more effective when they are lumped together as a group.\n\ns_04915: The new economic geography literature suggests that agglomeration economies are a key factor in increasing firm productivity (Krugman, 1991; Fujita et al.\n\ns_04965: As a result, we have projections for up to 147 countries (water, sanitation and rail have poorer coverage.)\n\ns_05015: The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides new evidence of the REER elasticity of total, goods and manufacturing exports, documenting its decline over time.\n\ns_05065: Thus, the use of export promotion services seems to be correlated with firm entry into export activities or with a higher survival rate, since the share of exporters in the samples of firms that did not use EPA services declined between 2006 and 2010 in all countries, except Colombia.\n\ns_05115: It should be noted that for the D-index calculations (but not elsewhere) we reverse our coding of some variables so that we are assessing inequality in the optimal outcome (thus, not dying in the first year of life, rather than dying in the first year of life, and so on), to maintain comparability across both negative and positive outcomes.21 We implement the D-index in STATA using the module hoi(Azevedo, Franco, Rubiano, & Hoyos, 2010).\n\ns_05165: The following figure shows the result of the exercise and compares the growth scenarios in the presence of TFP growth to the Baseline and Efficiency + Participation Scenarios.\n\ns_05215: The dependent variable in Panel A is the difference in utilization at a given provider between baseline and follow-up.\n\ns_05265: But basic service cost and quality data (e.g.\n\ns_05315: Define ZETAi = RALPHi * SHAREi and ZETAT = the sum of ZETAi over all states i except the \"reference state\".\n\ns_05365: To correct for potential biased coefficients, we estimate the more complete specification, equation 5, using instrumental variables.\n\ns_05415: 3 Douidich et al, 2013; SWIFT."
