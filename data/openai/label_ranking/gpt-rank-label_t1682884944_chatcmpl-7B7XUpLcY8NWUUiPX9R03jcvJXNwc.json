The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07403: The inclusion of time trend instead of specific variables is generally justified on the ground of lack of availability of data or multicollinearity among variables.\n\ns_07453: The two-step approach provides a more comprehensive analysis mainly because it allows the use of the whole sample when rerunning the first set of regressions, which is not feasible when using ODA debt forgiveness as the independent variable because it is equal to zero for most of the countries in the sample during 1984-88.\n\ns_07503: One study that attempted to measure employers' costs through a survey was Beveridge's for England'.\n\ns_07553: Iii fact, it was found tt.iat SSA had more favora' -arrangements ir.\n\ns_07603: when comparing the levels of industrial output in 1952 and 1987, a series of chain-linked calculations is used (see Field, JEC 1986, p. 509] and the resulting time series is described as being based on \"comparable* (kmi) rather than \"constant' (bbian) prices.\n\ns_07653: The initial stage of the concerted lending approach reflected the perception that the debt servicing difficulty was a temporary phenomenon, giving rise to the need to \"buy time\".\n\ns_07703: Thus these two measures of the delay in harvest evacuation actually engendered by the CIDT are negatively related to distance while the considerations stressed in Table 6 and the accompanying discussion suggest that it is optimal that these correlations be positive.\n\ns_07753: A dummy variable has been included for 1976 since there was a large and unexplained drop in private investment in this year.\n\ns_07803: A feeling for the results can be obtained by considering the row of means.\n\ns_07853: This review will be carried out on a sample basis at least annually in preparation for the implementation review workshop (para.\n\ns_07903: There are a few points that are worth noting.\n\ns_07953: These transactions are summarized in Figures 2 and 3 .\n\ns_08003: Business Week Online, July 26, 2004.\n\ns_08053: However, evidence from other countries in the region suggests electricity tariff reforms can have a significant impact on household fuel choice.\n\ns_08103: 14 The use of GDP as a scale variable is based on the implicit assumption that it is the main determinant of tax collection.\n\ns_08153: [ Table 1 about here] population and their income shares are the only data given.\n\ns_08203: But like the value of college, the importance of the subsidy varies considerably across individuals for the same reasons.\n\ns_08280: \u2022 Access to Data: Data is typically available in public and/or restricted form.\n\ns_08330: The dataset codes thirteen public health measures and seven economic policies taken by governments to respond to COVID-19.\n\ns_08380: In the population based dataset we tested for an association of AD GPS and number of APOE \u03b54 alleles with peripheral iron measures (iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin) using Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithm (GEMMA) software [37] .\n\ns_08430: Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the one using voxel intensities despite only a small number of features is needed to achieve that result.\n\ns_08480: Given that the typical genetic and sporadic forms of AD are very similar with respect to postmortem findings, clinical course, and evidence from the emerging biomarker and imaging cascade in sporadic AD, this seems a reasonable assumption (Shepherd et al., 2009) .\n\ns_08530: -models, appropriate and good quality data on present as well as on the past are crucial (Cohen and Soto 2007) .\n\ns_08580: MRI data included volume and thickness measures of 98 regions estimated by FreeSurfer.\n\ns_08630: Given recent findings that suggest substantial rural-urban differences in the distribution of waivered physicians 40 and opioid agonist treatment patterns, 33 we hypothesized that the amount of buprenorphine dispensed by providers in urban and rural counties would be significantly different."
