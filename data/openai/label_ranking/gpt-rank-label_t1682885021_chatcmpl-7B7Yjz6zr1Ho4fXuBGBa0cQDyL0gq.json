The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07405: In a single country context, the aggregate output is obtained as follows' 2\n\ns_07455: The analysis first compares countries that have received significant amounts of ODA debt forgiveness in recent years with those that have not, and then compares the two groups of countries during 1984-88 and 1989-93 (ODA debt forgiveness surged during the latter period).\n\ns_07505: This seems to be specially true for the largest AFPs, who already enjoy to some degree the advantages of joint collection, so the savings for them are smaller.\n\ns_07555: For example, between 1970s and 1980s, Africa's world market share for three main agricultural exports -coffee, cocoa and cotton -shrank by 22, 12 and 18 percent respectively.\n\ns_07605: Table 9 pnsents energy consumption data for 15 branches during 1980/85.\n\ns_07655: How will a debt reduction response to a country's request, the creditors operation affect the country's access to commeragree to negotiate to reduce the burden of cial and private sector finance in the future?\n\ns_07705: I gives the ratio of producers, surp(us from cotton undor I pricing to that from panterritorial pricing from the left hand panel of Table 3 for ao=0.67.\n\ns_07755: Source: Pick's Currency Yearbook, various year.\n\ns_07805: The initial model was given by:\n\ns_07855: 1688-TA), and estimates for other African countries.\n\ns_07905: Thus, the present value of tax depreciation allowances ls in part influenced by investment decisions taken in period t*-l even though the its income generated in period t* is fully taxed.\n\ns_07955: However, care was taken in sample selection to avoid obvious sources of bias, and all five types of interviews were carried out in all the major districts of the city.\n\ns_08005: For instance, there is a need to review the approach selected for setting the insurance premium.\n\ns_08055: Unfortunately, data on Montenegrin household electricity consumption at different electricity price levels are not available in the ISSP 2004 survey or from previous household surveys.\n\ns_08105: Finally, the bottom panel of figure 2 shows the trajectory of public investment relative to overall primary spending of the public sector.\n\ns_08155: We conclude with a research agenda.\n\ns_08205: At the other end, about one-quarter of the population values college at a level equivalent to 30 percent of their total consumption.\n\ns_08282: Some are federal databases established to monitor and better understand educational policy and student outcomes.\n\ns_08332: Second, our dataset covers economic measures to a larger extent than Hale et al.\n\ns_08382: We used linear mixed model regression using the likelihood ratio test, including sex, age and four ancestry principal components as covariates and controlling for family structure using a genetic relatedness matrix estimated from genome wide genotypes.\n\ns_08432: This paper thus proposes a methodology to identify regions of interest by segmenting 3-D FDG-PET scans and extracting features that represent each of those regions of interest, reducing the dimensionality of the space.\n\ns_08482: We begin by summarizing both the current state of AD therapeutic development and the paradigm shift that is occurring with respect to being able to detect and track underlying AD-related pathologies in humans in the absence of significant cognitive impairment, as both of these issues are critical to how the dilemma has arisen and how we might solve it.\n\ns_08532: The outcome of this exercise is to this date the most comprehensive harmonized dataset on educational attainment.\n\ns_08582: The sparse models generated by elastic net identified a small set of meaningful imaging and proteomic biomarkers and were much easier to interpret than SVM-based models.\n\ns_08632: 16 Most individuals who might benefit from these medications, however, do not receive them, 17,18 which is the reason for the recent efforts to expand their use."
