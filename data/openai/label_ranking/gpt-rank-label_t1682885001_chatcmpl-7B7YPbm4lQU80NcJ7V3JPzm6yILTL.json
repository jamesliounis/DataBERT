The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01172: d TCHP map under the 'without warm eddy encountering' scenario, that is, based on the climatological condition during Rita's intensification from category 1 to peak strength was mostly between 500 and 1,200 Wm -2 .\n\ns_01222: Baseline MMSE category was strongly associated with baseline ADAS-Cog scores (P , .001).\n\ns_01272: Whilst the survey is one of the most of advanced international assessments of digital ability, the survey does not cover many G20 developing/emerging countries due to the focus on OECD member states.\n\ns_01322: For example, one study showed the atypical major depression subtype was associated with an increased prevalence of comorbid panic disorder and drug abuse/dependence [33] , whereas a national sample of US adults showed that more deviant personality and attitudes, increased psychiatric comorbidity, and parental alcohol/drug use were associated with membership in severe typical or atypical depressive classes relative to milder subtypes [22] .\n\ns_01372: Work-Package 5 (WP5) is responsible for collecting data from (1) CHR-P individuals, (2) FEP patients, and (3) healthy controls, in a naturalistic prospective design.\n\ns_01422: Indeed, MEI is highly positively correlated to WPI at zero lag and seems to lead WPI slightly, by 1~2 months (not shown).\n\ns_01472: The report states that one-third of this disparity is explained by the underrepresentation of women among the top 1 percent of NIH grant recipients.\n\ns_01522: Th ere are, however, no credible data to specify them correctly.\n\ns_01572: The frequency interval 0. )\n\ns_01622: However, we estimate that 87% of all imported COVID-19 cases came from Europe, 9.5% from North America, and 3.4% from South America.\n\ns_01672: Several databases are available that meet some of these requirements.\n\ns_01722: Residency demographics were defined by using US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum codes.\n\ns_01772: We simulate data from a linear model (1) using 50 replications, where \u03b5 \u223c N (0, I N ) and each row of X is independent and identically distributed from a normal distribution with mean 0 and an exchangeable covariance matrix determined by a variance parameter \u03c3 2 = 1 and a covariance parameter \u03c1.\n\ns_01822: As there is no agreement on which spatial weight matrix should be used, this study follows previous literature [9, 14, 48] to report the findings based on the first order Queen approach.\n\ns_01872: It was constructed using second follow-up parent questionnaire data; data from earlier survey waves were used if data were missing.\n\ns_01922: However, this information is then regenerated by clinical testing performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified molecular pathology laboratory at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP).\n\ns_01972: Of note, we did query Note: a n = 3 participants in the Scottish sample had missing data across these variables and were therefore excluded; b n = 2 participants in the N.I sample had missing data across these variables and were therefore excluded; c Participants could choose more than one pet and n = 5 participants has missing data across the entire sample for this question 'how worried people were about the ability of the health system to care for coronavirus patients if the situation worsens'.\n\ns_02022: There was a statistically significant difference between instrumentalists and non-instrumentalists in relation to the number of KS4 examinations taken with the instrumentalists taking 11.38 (SD = 1.88) and the non-instrumentalists 10.1(2.19).\n\ns_02072: More efforts need to be made in acquiring detection methods that save time with better portability while maintaining good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision.\n\ns_02122: For example, longitudinal endoscopy registries can provide reliable information on gastric cancer incidence and temporary trends and identify risk factors to design and implement targeted prevention efforts [5] .\n\ns_02172: Search conducted in two different time periods, 28 th March and then on 12 th April showed that 2172 and 9146 papers were published in these two periods; almost 320 percent growth during such a short time.\n\ns_02222: BDNF polymorphism was not associated with cognitive changes.\n\ns_02255: We restricted the analysis to those patients with at least 2 years of follow-up data (data not shown).\n\ns_02305: For purposes of this study, we created three inter-comparable descriptions of the Jamaica Bay watershed, representing the contemporary conditions; the landscape in the 1870s; and the pre-European landscape of c. 1609, when Henry Hudson arrived off the shores of what would someday become New York City [Sanderson, 2009].\n\ns_02355: ***P # 0.001. participants, the HOMA-IR main effects and HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interactions were also nonsignificant."
