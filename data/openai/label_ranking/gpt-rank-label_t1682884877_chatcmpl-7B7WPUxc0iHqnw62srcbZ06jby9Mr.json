The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09928: Finally the work of Gandal et al.\n\ns_09978: Thus, c4 = 129-0.0478 p2 -0.327c3 -0.0002063 p2\nThis can be represented as a\n\ns_00030: The NDAR data validation tool, which is available as a community resource, enables a researcher to confirm that his or her data conforms to the existing definitions.\n\ns_00080: Second, this approach allowed us to see how the inclusion of each successive covariate influenced the overall model and the other parameter estimates.\n\ns_00130: This may be in part because of sample size (the subsample of about 150 teenage fathers was divided into two roughly equal groups), but many of the means are so similar that a somewhat larger sample likely would not have resulted in statistical significance.\n\ns_00180: To our knowledge, this is the first use of deep learning based strategies specifically designed for registering sparse clinical images.\n\ns_00230: CFR is essentially the quotient between Deaths (D) and positive cases (C) detected.\n\ns_00277: The baseline test scores for patients with no MCI compared with the MCI subtypes, based on neuropsychological criteria, are given in table 2 .\n\ns_00327: Vice versa no data on the decline of sex steroids were available in the InChianti study even though measurements of total T, E 2 and SHBG serum levels were available for the majority of men 67, 70, 85 in this study hormonal data were mainly used for investigating the association between circulating sex steroids and several conditions that are common in aging 69, 68, 67, 70, 66 (Table 3 ).\n\ns_00377: Using WSIN to generate monitoring data provides opportunities to both promote public awareness and validate the effectiveness of green roofs, particularly when sensor networks are scaled up to provide information on a watershed scale.\n\ns_00427: This trade-off should be carefully evaluated at study design.\n\ns_00477: This study retrofitted the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade mathematics assessment by applying a specific CDM called the DINA (the deterministic, inputs, noisy, \"and\" gate) model to data from South Korea and Turkey.\n\ns_00527: Building on these causal relations, Sorenson et al.\n\ns_00577: Recognizing the great opportunities provided by recent advances in brain research coupled with the critical need for new technologies, a group of federal agencies and private foundations have joined forces and committed funds to the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advances in Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative.\n\ns_00627: What is the degree of increase?\n\ns_00669: Note that the Aquarius data are only for 1 year, but the interannual variability of the plume size can be very large [Grodsky et al., 2014].\n\ns_00719: Similar temperature vari-monitoring stations were converted to a twoables were tested but these variables were excluded dimensional grid, which was then used to assign because they exhibited strong positive correlations pollution values to the points in the survey, using with the ozone variable.\n\ns_00769: Despite the insight gleaned from analysis of NAEP and the original ECLS-K data, there are significant limitations in the aforementioned studies.\n\ns_00819: Based on the findings in this investigation, it is theorised that a programme such as the LLP does have the potential to initiate systemic change in the school district, subject to the following conditions.\n\ns_00869: Furthermore, Common Ravens and Red-tailed Hawks were more likely to nest in fragmented shrubsteppe areas (that is, areas that were near agriculture or close to habitat edges) than Ferruginous Hawks, which preferred more-contiguous sagebrush cover distant from vegetation, roads, and energy facilities (Coates and others, 2014) .\n\ns_00919: Given training data {( , ), = 1,2, \u2026 , } , where represents the feature vector for subject and \u2208 {1,2,3,4} represents its associated category label, the 4-category label could be transformed into a binary label for each binary \"larger than\" problem.\n\ns_00969: Similarly, air-sea coupling on sub-monthly time scale has been found to be important in the modulation of heavy precipitation events in this and other regions of the Mediterranean in a climatic modeling study (Berthou et al., 2016) .\n\ns_01019: For the future some extensions and improvements are foreseen.\n\ns_01069: Gini coefficients for all farm and all nonfarm households and for groups of households based on their type and age are shown in tables 9 and 10.\n\ns_01119: Importantly, we hypothesize that the influence of these interactions varies by children's own age, which is recognized as a \"person\" characteristic (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) or a referent status in other peer effects research (Justice, Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011) ."
