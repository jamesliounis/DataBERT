The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01581: In comparison with Case 4, it is found that the removal of Beiliao Island can make the highest water stage lower by 0.63m at Beiliao, 0.79m at Nanliao, 0.24m at Jiugang, and 0.19m at Touchien upstream.\n\ns_01631: Single nucleotide variants were called with a coverage depth of at least 20x and then polished consensus was generated using Nanopolish version 0.13.2 (25).\n\ns_01681: Optimizing SNR and tissue contrast through choice of field strength, pulse sequence design, and optimization of sequence parameters prior to initiation of a study is imperative.\n\ns_01731: Analyses in SEER*Stat of the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio also revealed an increased risk for subsequent pancreatic or renal cancers among these patients.\n\ns_01781: To integrate information from the multi-source observed data we propose a Multiple Blockwise Imputation (MBI) approach, incorporating not only the SI based on complete observations but also imputations from incomplete observations.\n\ns_01831: Second, most mortality research used the latest available data to explain the mortality differentials across social groups and long-term latency between disease onset and death has been overlooked [88] .\n\ns_01881: It is calculated by the DAS and produced with the correlation matrix.\n\ns_01931: The framework that has been established during the past two decades in the NBGB has enabled researchers to pursue a large number of diverse studies that address NDs from different approaches.\n\ns_01981: The COVID-19 Psychological Well-being Study was designed as a rapid data collection exercise across the UK population.\n\ns_02031: The trends observed in relation to English and mathematics was also seen in relation to overall attainment.\n\ns_02081: 112 It is currently assessed in more than 26 clinical trials ranging from phase II to IV, showing positive effects in shortening the treatment time and improving the lung condition of COVID-19 patients.\n\ns_02131: As seen in similar studies, there was a high prevalence of non-cardia and intestinal type of cancer in Central America.\n\ns_02181: One of the most influential study was by Ginsberg et al.\n\ns_02264: The study was approved by institutional review boards of all participating institutions.\n\ns_02314: For the c. 1870s land cover map, we mainly used digitized features from the Bache [1882] coast chart.\n\ns_02364: Mean FDG metabolism was derived for AD-vulnerable regions of interest (ROIs), including lateral parietal and posteromedial cortices, medial temporal lobe (MTL), hippocampus, and ventral prefrontal cortices (vPFC), as well as postcentral gyrus and global cerebrum control regions.\n\ns_02464: 6,16 Our study did not include specialists in our sample, so it remains unclear if there is something unique about the physicians and patients living in rural areas that leads to reduced use of LVC or if the decreased presence of specialists leads to reduced use of LVC.\n\ns_02514: In addition to classifying positive selection, we built a model to quantify the evolutionary fitness in empirical data.\n\ns_02564: A variable representing the producer's use of the Internet for marketing and sales (InternetUseIndex) was constructed based on activities defined in the OFRF survey.\n\ns_02614: Another group of researchers [43] conducted a meta-analysis involving 5403 patients with prostatic hyperplasia coming from different countries, divided into those with and without metabolic syndrome.\n\ns_02664: This also suggests that relatively small differences in cortisol levels can exhibit significant effects on memory performance.\n\ns_02714: (corresponding to a gap of 54%, or about $13,000, at the mean) in that year, so the above assumptions imply that it will shrink by about 0.38 log points over the next quarter century.\n\ns_02764: It might also be partially due to the coarse classification resolution for developed lands within the cross-walked classification scheme, with only one land cover class representing the many different types of developed land, and therefore no possibility of assessing intensification of land use (i.e.\n\ns_02814: It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study in assessing potential complexities of pathways through which preterm birth and SES may separately and jointly influence children's cognitive outcomes."
