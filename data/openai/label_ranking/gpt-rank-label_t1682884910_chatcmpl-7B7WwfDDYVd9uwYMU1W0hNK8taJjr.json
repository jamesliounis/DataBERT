The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08679: TIMSS-2003 mathematics and science achievement scales summarise Year 8 (JSS2) students' performance on test items designed to measure a wide range of student knowledge and understanding.\n\ns_08729: The above target frequencies (1) and durations (3), plus SM, RMSE, SD, and WOF (for water levels only) are required for the assessment of nearly all variables, and are collectively called the Standard Suite of Statistics.\n\ns_08779: Relative to employed respondents, respondents who were unable to work were almost twice as likely to have participated in research (OR = 1.98; CI = 1.21-3.23).\n\ns_08829: We could thus conclude that the network was not overfitting and we could use it for the visualization task.\n\ns_08879: For instance, in their analysis of neoliberalism and education in Australia and New Zealand, Davies and Bansel (2007: 248) show how the marketization of the system-with a focus on employability, human capital and competition-has fostered the construction of 'neoliberal subjects' as individuals who are increasingly transferring socio-structural risks onto themselves.\n\ns_08929: For example, various correlations or the precise value of certain measurements might be predicted as well.\n\ns_08979: Reprojected Landsat images were obtained through the USGS Global Visualization Viewer, while reprojected MODIS images since 2004 were provided by the NASA MODIS Rapid Response System.\n\ns_09029: In constructing this variable, we also sought to address spatial dependence in the logistic regression model.\n\ns_09079: It can provide additional information of the TC cloud patterns important to TC's overall structure and organization, especially for a potential low-level circulation center.\n\ns_09129: In other words, the classifier is trained on the AD and NL but is used as a \"recommender\" for the test MCI subject.\n\ns_09179: Data-collection procedures were similar to those used in BPS:12/14.\n\ns_09229: Some ex ante estimates were discovered, as well, for technologies not yet released for commercial adoption at the time of the studies.\n\ns_09279: Although these limitations may be minimized in younger, healthier populations, use of these tools in older populations may be problematic, as older individuals spend most of their time in light activities generally not categorized as \"physical activity\" and in whom cognitive impairments may contribute to imprecise recall (7) .\n\ns_09329: We obtain a good agreement between our classification results and the ground truth data.\n\ns_09379: ADNI is the result of the efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada.\n\ns_09429: Notably, mediation analysis in cross-sectional studies is considered a causal model that can suggests a direction of influence, based on pre-defined causal associations among the variables posited by the investigator (Figure 1 ).\n\ns_09479: Those samples in nearby clades include several cases from Pakistan, Kuwait, Canada, and Norway (Fig 7) .\n\ns_09529: The disease was caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) classified on the same day by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [2] .\n\ns_09579: If neither sample size nor time period varied, we selected effect sizes from the oldest age period from the sample, as these were rarer than other types of change estimates.\n\ns_09629: Accordingly, we begin our analysis using time diaries collected by the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).\n\ns_09679: With the initial dictionary D by selected patches, we summarize the SCC algorithm in Algorithm 1.\n\ns_09729: The physical sciences and engineering are at particular risk, with declines in the number of earned doctorates in these fields among U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the past decade (2) (figs.\n\ns_09779: Methods: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET images of 109 patients recruited in the ongoing longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were included in this analysis.\n\ns_09829: The findings of this study also agreed with those of Al-Balasi and Barham (2010), who concluded that using multiple mathematical representations enhanced students' ability to solve word-based mathematical problems.\n\ns_09879: The final observation for patient i occurs at\n), where {a i , ."
