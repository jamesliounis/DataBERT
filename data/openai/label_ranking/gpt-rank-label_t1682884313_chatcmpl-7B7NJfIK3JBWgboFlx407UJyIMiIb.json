The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01755: Numerical studies and ADNI data application confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing variable selection methods under various missing mechanisms.\n\ns_01805: The third hypothesis indicated that the spatial autocorrelation affects the estimates of the relationships between segregation and mortality and spatial filtering approach would identify the spatial patterns that are not only related to county-level mortality but also shared by various segregation dimensions.\n\ns_01855: However, the reader should keep in mind the findings are based on projected data.\n\ns_01905: The Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC), the Penn Memory Center, the Frontotemporal Degeneration Center, the ALS Center, the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Penn Udall Center for Parkinson's Research each have protocols approved by the institutional review board to recruit patients, along with their clinical data, into research studies.\n\ns_01955: As such, a more diverse UK sample was collected in relation to country of residence and at the time of writing, this is the largest known data collection exercise on COVID-19 and mental wellbeing in NI.\n\ns_02005: There were statistically significant differences between the instrumentalists and noninstrumentalists in their performance in mathematics at KS2 (F(1,605) = 16.68, p < .0001).\n\ns_02055: KEYWORDS: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, antibody, vaccine, inhibitor, transmission, pandemic T racing back to the emergence of COVID-19, 27 cases of acute respiratory pneumonia of unknown etiology were confirmed in Wuhan, China by December 2019.\n\ns_02105: so data sets were collected to fit in the same age groups.\n\ns_02155: Co-citation analysis helps to capture papers that are co-cited together in a large number of papers.\n\ns_02205: Innovation in Aging, 2019, Vol.\n\ns_02238: Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of interest.\n\ns_02288: The detailed report (the present document) presents an in depth look at the methods used to create the scenarios and assess the impacts contained within AdaptMap\n\ns_02338: To this end, we used Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to calculate the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), an index of peripheral IR.\n\ns_02388: This study was supported by NSF Grant 0955967 (Physical Oceanography), NASA Grant\n\ns_02438: Second, the long rightside tail of the PCP sample distribution of perpatient LVC Medicare spending in Appendix Figure 1 indicated that a small number of PCPs with \"extremely high\" LVC spending could be driving the results.\n\ns_02488: In addition, we integrate existing population genetic statistics, such as TajD and FWuH, at the sliding window step to improve model performance by combining multiple features with our CNN estimates.\n\ns_02538: The variable for the provision of extension services in Dinar's analysis was count data on the number of visits, an indicator with a substantial degree of heterogeneity across the types of farms in the study region.\n\ns_02588: Basic statistics included determination of the group sizes, minima, maxima, first and third quartiles, medians, quartile ranges, arithmetic means and standard deviations.\n\ns_02638: While some of these effects are acute (Lupien and McEwen, 1997; Lupien et al., 2002; Meir Drexler and Wolf, 2016) , some appear to be long-lasting and may even involve long-term changes in the brain structure (Geerlings et al., 2015) .\n\ns_02688: The results are illustrated in Table 3 .\n\ns_02738: The objectives of this study were to develop a land use change map for the Lake Superior basin, using existing data products, to highlight the need for consistent land cover maps and to assess the potential for detecting the various types of land cover change using existing maps.\n\ns_02788: To describe the observed joint distribution of gestational and household SES, we computed mean scores and standard deviations for the 25 subgroups of 5 GA categories and 5 household SES quintiles.\n\ns_02838: This study consisted of secondary data analysis of the ECLS-B collected when the children were 9 months and 2 years of age.\n\ns_02888: Other reasons discussed in the literature include technical difficulties (Couper, Blair, and Triplett, 1999), the respondent's inability to determine the questionnaire length (Ramos, Sedivi, and Sweet, 1997;Abraham, Steiger, and Sullivan, 1998), perceived lack of Internet expertise, and cost of Internet service for limited usage plans.\n\ns_02938: The rust four components from tim stmknt data are the same as the components used from parent data (in other words, edwation-level data, items 34A and 348, similarly recoded; occupation' data, items 4B and 7B of stolent questionnaire part ow, also recoded)."
