The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00415: The difference in annual rate of change and similarity of estimated sample size is likely a combined effects of cohorts, tracer, and quantification methods, and further investigation is necessary.\n\ns_00465: It should be noted that model-data fit and item fit statistics may have an effect on the interpretations of item parameter estimates obtained from a DINA model.\n\ns_00515: We indexed changes between predicted baselines and projected future distributions using change in a species' spatial distribution.\n\ns_00565: Moreover, the integration of advances arising from the genetic dissection of brain disorders with the kinds of tools and technologies emerging from the BRAIN Initiative is likely to be critical if gene lists are ultimately to be translated in a manner that improves human health.\n\ns_00615: In addition, the genetic profile of individuals may vary depending on age, ethnicity, medication use, and underlying medical conditions such as endometriosis.\n\ns_00657: [2012b], the impact of stratification on surface cooling is relatively small for CIs exceeding 30 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , and more important for low CIs.\n\ns_00707: spring (April-June) precipitation in the county, in Ozone data were obtained from EPA's Aerometinches, and the total precipitation squared.\n\ns_00757: For instance, in 2011, White eighth graders scored approximately a standard deviation higher than their Black peers while males scored approximately 0.15 standard deviations higher than females (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012; U.S. Department of Education, 2012).\n\ns_00807: Therefore, \"when the demands on one part of the system are linked to the demand of other parts, those parts will only perform well if they are connected together\" (Bar-Yam cited in Duffy, 2010:3) .\n\ns_00857: In Wyoming, elevated nests were used in consecutive years more often than were ground nests (Phillips and Beske, 1990) .\n\ns_00907: We experimented with baseline MRI scans of 1776 subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1, ADNI GO, and ADNI 2.\n\ns_00957: However, such signal appears not to be present in other observational dataset that are part of the assimilation process of the CCMP product.\n\ns_01007: For example the cylindrical sections in the middle of the tanks are a bit higher in the PMP representation.\n\ns_01057: The ARMS data for 2001 include information for 7,343 households.\n\ns_01107: Clustered standard errors are one way to address the fact that there is independence of observations across clusters but children within clusters (in our case, classrooms) share some similarities that result in bias in the standard errors of coefficients (for examples of preschool research that uses this approach, see also Duncan et al., 2015; Weiland & Yoshikawa, 2014) .\n\ns_01157: 2012), a parameter that represents the ocean heat anomaly contained in waters warmer than 26\u00b0C, has been shown to reduce the error in intensity forecasts of tropical Atlantic hurricanes when used as a predictor in statistical prediction methods (Shay et al.\n\ns_01207: Methods: We included 2882 participants with mild to moderate AD in seven studies from a meta-database.\n\ns_01257: The consequent data collection instrument will be used to measure the progressive realization of digital literacy across the G20.\n\ns_01307: Of the 29 studies that assessed heterogeneity in the trajectories of mood and anxiety disorders (Additional file 2), 22 assessed depression, three assessed anxiety, two assessed general anxiety and depression, one assessed symptoms of hyperactivity, and one assessed PTSD.\n\ns_01357: Table 2 lists some potential benefits and challenges that can arise when performing multicenter studies involving imaging acquisition.\n\ns_01407: When the number of variables is large, geographic arrangement of data locations can be used to organize correlation information in map form.\n\ns_01457: If application behavior were collected, methods are available to correct for these unobserved differences and further our understanding of gender differences in grant funding.\n\ns_01507: Missing records in this database were replaced with regional averages reported by the USDA (Potter et al., 2006, Table 34 ).\n\ns_01557: The hydrographs and the sediment properties for the two river inflows during the same period of the computation were provided by another research group in the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan The boundary conditions of tidal elevations and wave properties at the offshore in the three-year simulation were given by using a regional storm-surge model (a POM model) and the SWAN wave model (SWAN 2007) .\n\ns_01607: C.J.V-A is supported by an ERC Starting Grant (award number 757688)."
