The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02498: a, For classifying positive selection, we chose the top scoring model based on the F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) in a holdout set of 3000 neutral and 3000 positive selection simulated populations.\n\ns_02548: The quantile regression model for count data suggests that the impact of farm size has different effects across the distribution of demand for technical information.\n\ns_02598: [70] examined Chinese men, and similar to our study they found that metabolic syndrome and low HDL levels may be considered risk factors for BPH.\n\ns_02648: One randomized controlled trial in a small sample of patients with mild to moderate AD dementia showed improvement of cognitive performance in memory tasks, but the premature termination did not allow any firm conclusions regarding efficacy (Pomara et al., 2002) .\n\ns_02698: Our projections of the future black income distribution (relative to whites), then, are obtained by inflating the income of each black family in the 2000 data by 32%\n(=ln(1+0.38)).\n\ns_02748: Using this common land cover classification (classes are briefly described in Table 2), we compared the explicit amount and relative amount (total hectares and proportion of each area as percents) for each of the common land cover classes that occurred across the two time steps for the entire Lake Superior basin, for the U.S. portion of the Lake Superior basin only, and for the Canadian portion of the Lake Superior basin only.\n\ns_02798: The addition of terms for interaction between GA group and household SES was not statistically significant (P = 0.82; Figure 2B ).\n\ns_02848: Yet, some limitations stem from the use of secondary data analysis as some variables of interest, such as maternal individual preferences, were not included in the survey.\n\ns_02898: Another relevant study was conducted by Westat in 1999.\n\ns_02948: Generally, whether de statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value fct the diffaence between a pa:7 of means or Foportions and corn g this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels.\n\ns_02998: These materials were developed under the expert assistance of a specialist in the field of pedagogy of primary school Martynenko Svitlana Mykolaivna, Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences, Professor.\n\ns_03048: The major goals of the NA-ADNI are: (i) to develop improved methods that will lead to uniform standards for acquiring longitudinal multisite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data on patients with AD, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and elderly controls, and (ii) to build an accessible data repository that describes the biomarkers longitudinal changes [8] .\n\ns_03098: Second, rice production has received considerable attention as a multifunctional crop in different regions, as for example in the European Common Agricultural Policy or in Japan and other Asian countries (Cooper et al, 2009;Matsuno et al., 2006).\n\ns_03148: 2 0 However, we have evidence that the topics of discussion in the gram sabha are related to subsequent public goods outcomes.\n\ns_03198: There is a solution to this problem.\n\ns_03248: Evidence in line with the first result has also been provided by Harrigan [16] , David and Weinstein [8] , Bernstein and Weinstein [4] , and Leamer [24] .\n\ns_03298: The first set of results reported in section 4 will come from this simple model to establish that there is an event affecting the banking industry in the selected dates, before turning to test whether the events have a differential effect across banks.\n\ns_03348: See, for instance,Wilson et al.\n\ns_03398: The index suffers from two problems: aggregation and aggregate trade imbalances-see Greenway and Milner (1987) .\n\ns_03448: We employ industry-level data to construct meaningful proxies for sunkenness and thus directly to quantify contestability.\n\ns_03498: The results on three key patterns-order of appearance, convexity, and returns to scaleare displayed in Figure 2 , where activities are ordered by the per capita income level at which they appear.\n\ns_03548: To ensure our results are not an artifact of measurement error, we have removed all anomalous observations from our dataset (see the Appendix for a detailed discussion on how anomalous observations were identified).\n\ns_03598: The data sources are provided under the \"Source\" column.\n\ns_03648: China has applied for accession to the Agreement, and while Anderson (2008) notes that -work on the accession of China, while obviously a complex and challenging undertaking, is progressing well,\u2016 it is evidently not an easy negotiation.\n\ns_03698: Reliable data on tax-financed spending however is very limited, to some extent reflecting the fact that a significant share of infrastructure spending is moved off-budget."
