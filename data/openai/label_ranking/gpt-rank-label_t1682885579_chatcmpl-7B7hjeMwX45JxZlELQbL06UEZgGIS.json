The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00836: The term \"collective\" used here refers to any group of people who share work, such as partnerships, work groups and communities (McCauley et al., 2010) .\n\ns_00886: In Alberta, nesting densities of Ferruginous Hawks increased as the percentage of cultivation on plots increased to 30 percent and then declined as the percentage of cultivation on plots continued to increase (Schmutz, 1989) .\n\ns_00936: The success of deep learning techniques in pattern recognition (Goodfellow et al., 2016) in recent years have witnessed promising performance in learning imaging features for a variety of pattern recognition tasks (Gulshan et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2016; Esteva et al., 2017) .\n\ns_00986: The composite average of the time evolution of winter SSTA before and after the occurrence of intense wind events, computed for the different values of the threshold is shown in figure 2a .\n\ns_01036: However, the goals of each tool are somewhat different.\n\ns_01086: Jappelli (1999) confirmed the hump-shaped life-cycle of wealth using data from Italy.\n\ns_01136: As a precaution, however, we also estimated a series of models that looked at the 6 three dimensions of the CLASS (i.e., emotional, organizational, and instructional support) as opposed to an overall composite.\n\ns_01186: At NHC, testing is underway to drive the SLOSH model more efficiently and use multiple model/aids, including the new HFIP models wind parameters to create multimodel ensembles that can capture the uncertainty of the wind parameters and thus provide more reliable storm surge predictions (Forbes and Rhome 2012).\n\ns_01236: Enrichment using this criterion would select individuals with greater severity as being more likely to progress, which would be consistent with the larger slopes (and greater potential for slope reduction) seen in our analysis.\n\ns_01286: Effectiveness at synthesis and evaluation will enable the production of new content.\n\ns_01336: Seven of 17 studies distinguished clinical subtypes of bipolar disorder, depression, and panic attack based on definitions specified a priori.\n\ns_01386: In this article, we provide an overview of the PSYSCAN protocol and we discuss benefits and methodological challenges of large multicenter studies that employ neuroimaging measures.\n\ns_01436: The maximum correlation coefficient is 0.93 and 0.84 for the first and second modes, respectively.\n\ns_01486: Future research on women in science and engineering should address application.\n\ns_01536: We developed a geographically distributed cotton growth model from the original GOSSYM and optimized it for coupling with the regional Climate-Weather Research Forecasting model (CWRF).\n\ns_01586: The simulated morphological changes through the three-year typhoon events are plotted in Figure 4 (b) with the same legend in Figure 4 (a).\n\ns_01636: Since the first introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia (February 26, 2020) contacttracing efforts had been set in place.\n\ns_01686: Table 1 lists these artifacts and possible solutions.\n\ns_01736: The profound differences in median DSS time in yearsdfrom 21.5 and 3.6 for local and regional tumors, respectively, to 0.4 for distant tumorsdis striking and clinically applicable.\n\ns_01786: If there are no missing values in the r-th group, let G(r) = {r}, a completely observed dataset.\n\ns_01836: We also expect that 1. spatial dependence will bias the estimates of the relationships between segregation and mortality and as such a spatial filtering approach can help refine our model specification and be used to identify the spatial patterns.\n\ns_01886: These variables were either items taken directly from the NELS or BPS surveys or they were derived by combining one or more items in these surveys.\n\ns_01936: All the generated data are exported into Excel format for further research use.\n\ns_01986: Given the nature of the pandemic, the researchers were responsive to COVID-19 topics of public and scientific interest and inserted additional topics into future waves of data collection; for example attitudes to a COVID-19 vaccine (if one was to become available) and problematic drinking behaviours.\n\ns_02036: In a review of El Sistema and Sistema inspired projects, Creech et al."
