The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00987: (red line of figure A1 ).\n\ns_01037: This can be a good approximation when the tank is largely cylindrical and the dome surfaces are small compared to the cylindrical surface.\n\ns_01087: A difference of 0.01 is considered statistically significant.\n\ns_01137: Finally, all continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, and therefore, all estimates correspond to effect sizes (e.g., a Cohen's d).\n\ns_01187: The grids expand outward from the center of the basin, where they have the highest resolution (tens of meters), to the open ocean, where they reach their lowest resolution (typically about 10 km).\n\ns_01237: An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the independence of the slope and intercept parameters.\n\ns_01287: Within the context of this study, a discipline refers to a branch of knowledge and is found to be a more appropriate term to describe the skills required.\n\ns_01337: This is important since this research also suggests that the factors associated with these disorders may vary by symptom and trajectory subtype.\n\ns_01387: However, the involvement of several sites also introduces methodological challenges, particularly in controlling for the effects of site differences when acquiring imaging data.\n\ns_01437: (1998) suggested that JES SST varies with a period of 2~5 years, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) monthly SST on a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid during the period [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] .\n\ns_01487: Personal characteristics, such as gender, race, ethnicity, institution, and discipline, should also be included, it says, as well as the amount of money requested and the amount awarded.\n\ns_01537: Our strategy was to estimate both parameters through inverse modeling by optimization that minimizes local root mean square errors (RMSEs) of annual cotton yields simulated from observations during 1979 to 2005.\n\ns_01587: The wind speed data during the simulations were also provided by the regional storm-surge model.\n\ns_01637: A total of 133 nucleotide variants (NVs) were identified using the full genome sequences from Colombia and the reference NC_045512.2.\n\ns_01687: This review includes a table that clearly shows the lack of consistency in quantitative performance metrics used in the literature, clearly illustrating the need for standardized reporting methods.\n\ns_01737: On risk-adjusted multivariable analysis, advanced age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P\\.01), advanced stage (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.23-3.53; P\\.01), and lack of radiation therapy (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.79; P = .02) were found to be independent predictors of OS.\n\ns_01787: Sections 6 and 7 provide numerical studies through simulations and the ADNI data application.\n\ns_01837: To fill this gap, we obtained two reliable population health measures from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute [65] : average unhealthy days per month of the population in a county and the adult obesity rate.\n\ns_01887: Therefore, to isolate some of these associations, a multivariate analysis was conducted on these data.\n\ns_01937: Users have to undergo Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training and be included in the corresponding institutional review board-approved protocols to gain access to the database.\n\ns_01987: Our secondary aim was to provide a clear and concise account of the data that has been collected across the UK population and sub-divided by UK nation (England/Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland).\n\ns_02037: While playing an instrument made a lesser contribution than KS2 performance it was still highly statistically significant.\n\ns_02087: 72 The detection limits of this sensor for SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium and clinical samples were 1.6 \u00d7 10 1 pfu/mL and 2.42 \u00d7 10 2 copies/mL, respectively.\n\ns_02137: Of note, in Honduras, the country with highest-quality gastric cancer registry, the diffuse type was more common (Table 1) .\n\ns_02187: Table 3 highlights the areas covered in the COVID-19 papers."
