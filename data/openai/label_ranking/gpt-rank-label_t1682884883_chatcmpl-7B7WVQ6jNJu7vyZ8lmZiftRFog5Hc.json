The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02402: 619 Journal of Geophysical Research, 79, 831-846. doi.org/10.1029/JC079i006p00831.\n\ns_02452: Unfortunately, our data set and methods did not allow us to elucidate the specific mechanisms.\n\ns_02502: We then performed sliding window analysis, with a step size of 50 bp, across both the North America, Europe, and Asia SARS-CoV-2 samples using our combined CNN and LSTM approach.\n\ns_02552: Machado and Santos Silva (2005) developed a quantile count regression model based on a smoothing algorithm by constructing a continuous variable with conditional quantiles that have a one-to-one relationship with the conditional quantiles of the counts.\n\ns_02602: In that study the concentration of insulin in patients with diagnosed BPH significantly correlated with ChT and TAG levels.\n\ns_02652: Altogether, these data suggest that, mostly, cognitive deficits linked to increased cortisol and HPA axis dysregulation cannot be entirely explained by a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n\ns_02702: Our results represent a baseline expectation in the event that current trends continue, and are obviously sensitive to policy shifts that change relative outcomes of African American and white students.\n\ns_02752: Rather, we hope to highlight the need for, and provide a first step towards a consistent and repeatable bi-national land cover change analysis and eventual trend analysis for the Lake Superior basin.\n\ns_02802: potential confounders of both the exposure-outcome and modifier-outcome relationships were child's race/ethnicity, child's sex, maternal parity, maternal age at delivery, and household structure.\n\ns_02852: 1982; Sumner and Spietz 1994) .\n\ns_02902: Like computer-assisted systems, online questionnaires utilize real time skips and edits within the instrument, improving data quality, reducing the time needed to clean and edit the data, and decreasing respondent burden (Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000;Kwak and Radler, 2000;Abraham, Steiger, and Sullivan, 1998).\n\ns_02952: Tin weights used to calculate the estimates were consumed in a fashion that compensawd fo instrument Weighting miceduzes axe explained in the NELS:88 Base Year Student User's Afamial.\n\ns_03002: The results of the study made it possible to identify the conditions, limitations and factors that influence teachers' decisions regarding the implementation of monitoring support in the primary school education process.\n\ns_03052: The preparatory phase involved the collection of the I-ADNI MRI scanner features in terms of manufacturer, coils adopted, and magnetic strength (see Table 2 ).\n\ns_03102: Another variable, implementation of water management plans for irrigation, was found not significant but it may have an endogenous effect on the dependent variable as participation in a conservation program may require development of a water management plan for irrigation.\n\ns_03152: In estimating the relationship between discussion about roads and improvement we control for initial road quality, a wide range of village level variables, and block \u2026xed e\u00a4ects.\n\ns_03202: (2009) , which are Granger noncausality tests that actually find no evidence of influence by noncommercial long speculators on wheat or maize and only two significant cases of influence among 47 samples for rough rice, about what one would expect by chance at a 5% significance level.\n\ns_03252: Using input-output data for six member countries of the European Community for the years 1970 and 1980, the paper shows that allowing for international technique differences significantly improves the predictive power of the H-O-V model.\n\ns_03302: The results, reported in Panel B show a similar, although slightly larger and more significant stock price decline for banks that relied more on wholesale funds during the Lehman episode, confirming and strengthening the baseline findings.\n\ns_03352: It not only helps to circumvent multicolinearity by reducing the dimensions of the data, it is a less arbitrary and more rigorous procedure for deriving an \"aggregate\" indicator compared with averaging out primary indicators.\n\ns_03402: Has it indeed been the case?\n\ns_03452: This paper seeks to provide a new, economic explanation for the observed interindustry di\u00a4erences in the size distribution of \u2026rms.\n\ns_03502: To limit lower tail distortions when a non-linear fit is imposed on the data we only use for these estimates a linear per capita GDP term.\n\ns_03552: The Indonesian Manufacturing Census (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) collected by the Indonesian Statistical Agency, BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik), provides the empirical basis for our analysis.\n\ns_03602: This paper is also related to the literature that studies contagion in financial markets (see among others Forbes and Rigobon 2002, Kee-Hong Bae and Stulz 2003) and also the literature that examines the impact of globalization on convergence of asset prices (Bekeart and Wang 2009 , Longin and Solnik 1995 , Bekaert and Harvey 2000 , and Bekaert, Hodrick and Zhang 2009 ."
