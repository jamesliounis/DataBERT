The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07694: These relations, illustrated numerically from Cote d'Ivoire data, dictate questions tiat ought to be asked in evaluating agricultural transport projects and, equally, in reviews of agricultural pricing or agricultural tax schemes.\n\ns_07744: / Due to limited data availability Includoe central govornment, SSIIT CMi, OKHC, but not other stat.-owne enterprises.\n\ns_07794: The survey results provide informiiation or.\n\ns_07844: 3.21), improve its billing and collection efficiency to agreed percentages (para.\n\ns_07894: These calculations are meant to be illustrative only since we lack the data needed for a more careful measurement of the user cost of capital.\n\ns_07944: '-he lack of adequate data on household water demand appears to be one of the reasons for these shortfalls.\n\ns_07994: The new explicit DIS may help to level the playing field somewhat, but expectations in this regard should be guarded.\n\ns_08044: World Bank Technical Paper No.\n\ns_08094: Pereira and Pinho (2006) report calculations analogous to Perotti's for 12 EU countries.\n\ns_08144: 15 In particular, this is likely to be the case for subtropical or tropical regions where calorie, by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) , who, in calculation of multidimensional inequality (income times life expectancy), use a calibration to transform these two variables into one.\n\ns_08194: The researchers find that overall, individuals place a value of about $6,000 per year on access to college, or nearly 15 percent of their total consumption (assuming that average consumption is about $40,000 annually).\n\ns_08244: All these factors have led to a great search for answers.\n\ns_08271: While current data collection provides intriguing snapshots of elements of college access and success for students with disabilities, the field needs more comprehensive information and a more coordinated effort to gather data that can be used to better understand how students with disabilities are faring in higher education.\n\ns_08321: A description of the fields in the database is shown below and is available through a data dictionary on the repositories.\n\ns_08371: In the SECA analysis exact binomial statistical tests are performed to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs associated in both datasets for 144 SNP subsets from 12x12 P-value threshold combinations.\n\ns_08421: This means that we will construct a feature space for each of these problems using the voxels intensities from two populations and the regions found in step 2 corresponding to the same two populations.\n\ns_08471: Collectively, these studies demonstrate a primary effect of genetic alterations that cause familial forms of AD is to alter Ab production or Ab itself in a way that promotes its aggregation and accumulation in the brain (Selkoe, 2001) .\n\ns_08521: The first approach which was primarily developed by Barro and Lee (1993 , and additional versions in 2001 and further used by other researchers such as Cohen and Soto (2007) , and De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2000) , to cite the most important ones, was to use the existing data points to inter-/extra-polate the missing data points using several methods such as the perpetual inventory method.\n\ns_08571: (3) While FreeSurfer data performed slightly better in classifying HC vs AD than RBM data, the latter had surprisingly greater power to distinguish MCI from HC (87.4%) and AD (83.7%).\n\ns_08621: We consulted the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes 41 (RUCC) from the Area Resource File (ARF) to categorize the urbanization of all counties containing a buprenorphine provider (waivered physician, opioid treatment programs, or substance abuse treatment facilities).\n\ns_08671: TIMSS-2003 used standards, procedures and guidelines that ensured that country samples were of the highest quality, thus making achievement results comparable across countries.\n\ns_08721: The constituent with the highest correlation with the total observed signal is then subtracted from the observed time series, and the matrix is recalculated with a residual time series in place of the observed.\n\ns_08771: Furthermore, the study investigated the independent effects of predictors (sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and presence of chronic conditions) on: i) health research participation, ii) opportunities to participate in health research, and iii) willingness to participate in health research.\n\ns_08821: Moreover, we would like to study whether the visualization method is able to differentiate between overfitting, random and correctly trained networks.\n\ns_08871: Jamie, for example, had just completed a degree in accountancy, and he described his future with great enthusiasm: In keeping with the survey trends discussed in the literature review, however, it was more common for young people to express positive views about their 'personal' future and negative perceptions about the future of society as a whole."
