The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02694: Our re-assignment has the effect of closing the black-white gap in mean scores (in the income-reweighted data) by 30 points, the gap in median scores by 34, and the gap at the 90 th percentile by 24.\n\ns_02744: Although this effort was complicated by differences in classification schemes (and slightly different dates), we were able to develop a common set of land cover classes both across the basin and across the time steps available.\n\ns_02794: While we were not able to assess whether such changes in SES occurred, the composite SES index-reflecting income, educational attainment, and occupation-was plausibly more stable against this concern compared with using only household income to measure SES.\n\ns_02844: For example, the TAS-45 was used to examine the associations between food security during infancy and subsequent attachment behaviors in toddlerhood and the associations between attachment security and child obesity (Anderson and Whitaker 2011; Zaslow et al.\n\ns_02894: Some users are used to searching for Web sites using a search engine.\n\ns_02944: Using the standanlized formula score in this report, we know that the mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10, thus we consider any difference in effect sizes of 3 points or more (.3 of a standard deviation) to be stanAically and practically significant\n\ns_02994: This study goes in line with our literature review findings and contributes to the study of the problem of introducing monitoring in the educational process in primary school.\n\ns_03044: Relative stacked column graphs show comparable SNR and CNR values in I-ADNI qualified centers.\n\ns_03094: An intermediate aggregation could also be explored where multifunctionality is categorized into groups that are related to: (1) working lands conservation programs, (2) land retirement programs and (3) agritourism/recreation.\n\ns_03144: To estimate this e\u00a4ect, we include in our regression an interaction 16 term between the characteristic of interest and landownership.\n\ns_03194: There were comparable spikes around 1996-smaller for wheat, larger for maize.\n\ns_03244: T he first column reports coefficients of the baseline model.\n\ns_03294: Finally, this paper also contributes to the literature on international contagion (Glick and Rose, 1999; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 2000; Kaminsky et al., 2003; among others) , by providing evidence of a different channel through which financial turmoil may spread across countries.\n\ns_03344: These studies show that estimates can be derived from different theoretical frameworks, such as the Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin, and increasing returns to scale models.\n\ns_03394: Table 9 reports correlation coefficients of EU-oriented exports (below the diagonal in italics) and\n\ns_03444: 2 Previous 0 This paper-a product of the Environment and Energy Team of the Development Research Group-is also being published in the Review of Industrial Organization.\n\ns_03494: In a second stage, we compare this cross-section aggregate development path, which serves as a benchmark, with the individual, dynamic development paths followed by specific country groupings, grouped by initial income levels and by regions.\n\ns_03544: We use the data on political connections collected byMobaraq and Purbasari, 2008.\n\ns_03594: Section 2 describes the data sources and describes the construction of the Merton (1974) default risk measure.\n\ns_03644: 1 Figure 1 presents the results.\n\ns_03694: Taking the state of the economy into account can lead to very different results (Parker 2011) .\n\ns_03744: The succeeding section applies the framework to the cases and develops expected findings.\n\ns_03794: Our analysis is also related to the literature on bond covenants going back to Smith and Warner (1979) .\n\ns_03844: Second, as we explain in more detail below, we use the results from the random choice model to justify the construction of certain variables used in the analysis of Table 6 .\n\ns_03894: A summary of the values obtained, both in total and normalized in terms of Rs."
