The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08886: Thus, individualization has removed some old constraints, but it has also created new ones (Beck, 2007) .\n\ns_08936: In the rest of this paper, I will first try to demonstrate that testing exclusively by curve fitting is very weak and a poor way for macroecology to proceed in the search for mechanisms.\n\ns_08986: While ice motion during the general breakup period in 2008 was complicated (see above), in all years for which we have radar observations of drift in the coastal lead during thermal breakup, ice in the coastal lead and nearshore ice at UIC-NARL drifted predominantly in the same direction (2006,2008,2009).\n\ns_09036: The effect of our racial similarity variable-i.e., the ratio of the percent of white students to neighborhood white population-stood out as a very powerful and positive predictor of open campus policy holding in our first regression model.\n\ns_09086: The upper-left panel is the GOES IR image, while the upper-right panel is the enhanced IR image (VIS imagery is used in daytime when it is available) with the Dvorak method for improved TC analysis.\n\ns_09136: We propose a modeling strategy using supervised feature extraction to optimally combine highdimensional imaging modalities with several other low-dimensional disease risk factors.\n\ns_09186: In particular, staff compared the distributions of the observed, imputed, and complete (observed and imputed) data to screen variables for further investigation.\n\ns_09236: In the states where a range of yield differences could be reported, all show an unambiguous yield increase with Bt corn, although one estimate (Illinois 1998) is probably below the break-even yield increase that would cover the additional cost of the Bt corn seed.\n\ns_09286: Although part of the association may be explained by retirement, after adjusting for employment status, the strength of the association between age and physical activity was only partially reduced.\n\ns_09336: It appeared that such differences did indeed occur, and that a good correspondence was achieved between the diagnosis and the ground truth data.\n\ns_09386: Voxels were then excluded if their modulated GM probability was less than 0.2 or if short of significance (p N 0.05) according to a two-sample t-test (Chaves et al., 2009) .\n\ns_09436: The prevalence of male gender also tended to increase across AC severity groups, together with the number of participants of white ethnicity and the use of lipid-lowering drugs (mostly statins), bisphosphonate and vitamin D supplements.\n\ns_09486: As we observed CPE in the infected monolayers, RT-PCR was used as a confirmatory assay.\n\ns_09536: Roughly, 8-12% cases of acute myocardial injury reported significant elevation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) [86] .\n\ns_09586: Many of these studies reported information on rank-order consistency and mean-level change, although Roberts and DelVecchio did not examine the latter in this previous study.\n\ns_09636: The statistical significance of mean differences between male and female respondents is tested using t tests.\n\ns_09686: Then sparse coding is applied to the resulting surface patch features, followed by max-pooling to extract the final feature sets.\n\ns_09736: CAREER CHOICE Coefficients of nested models\n\ns_09786: These ROIs in the sample series are composed of voxels whose series share some similarity; some regions are homogeneous while some are heterogeneous.\n\ns_09836: Research followed a case study approach throughout three phases.\n\ns_09886: The network, as shown in Figure 2 , is conceptually divided into 3 sections: 1) A shared temporal layer to learn the temporal and cross-correlations between variables, 2) task-specific layers to learn shared representations between related trajectories, and 3) an output layer which computes parameters for predictive sub-model distributions for use in likelihood loss computations during training and generating predictive distributions at run-time.\n\ns_09936: We initially concentrate on US-resident emigrants because of their importance to each of the three countries and also because the US data is best.\n\ns_09986: Please observe that the coefficient of determination is at 99% with only 1% of the explanation of the variation in the dependent variable not being explained by the specified variable.\n\ns_00038: With a relatively large number of images made available in one site, NDAR is a good source of raw data to compare results from different processing pipelines and to see which of those derived results correlate with data from the clinical and environmental assessments or with the demographic information about research subjects.\n\ns_00088: This stratified analysis allowed us to determine whether our findings for the predictive value of each of the three LRA categories (compared with neither HSSLRA nor CLRA participation) observed in the analysis of model 5 shown in Table 4 were consistent across each of the four racial/ ethnic groups (Table 3) ."
