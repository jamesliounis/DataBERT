The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05262: Their starting point could take the form of a benchmarking exercise relying on comparable operators in comparable contexts.\n\ns_05312: The formula applies a simple distribution of federal resources in direct proportion to the number of eligible students in a state, i.e., the population of children of school-going age.\n\ns_05362: For a detailed study on how ratings are changed, seeCruces (2001).\n\ns_05412: This would lead to high correlation between modules supporting the total consumption estimation.\n\ns_05462: where subscripts i and j index host and parent countries, respectively, and the subscript t indexes year, BilateralFDI is the bilateral FDI flow from country i to country j, MktSize a vector of GDP of the host and source countries, HCdiff measures the host and source countries' difference in human capital, Transport is a vector of transportation cost measures between country i and country j including air distance, sea distance, driving distance and driving time, Infrastructure is a vector of indices that measure the quality of trade-related logistic infrastructure including railway, airway, and port quality, PTAdepth measures the depth of the trade agreement between the host and source countries using the WTO RTA data, X is a vector of other country characteristics including a dummy variable for sharing border, a dummy for using same language, a dummy for sharing colonial ties, and a measure of business environment using the number of days required to start a business, and are vectors of country dummies used to control for all time-invariant country characteristics, and ia a vector of year dummies.\n\ns_05512: Moving forward, the team should refine and redesign the questionnaires according to the type of data collection -contributor-based or household survey -with relevant questions that target specific audiences.\n\ns_05562: Note: each figure is the average change between each country's first and last year in the sample, divided by the length of the period (in years).\n\ns_05612: Based on these results, we then compute how the probability of flooding may change for specified geographical locations in China and superimpose the wastewater assets we collected onto the changing flood hazard maps.\n\ns_05662: , 2003; Olaiz-Fern\u00e1ndez et al.\n\ns_05712: Recognizing this problem, the paper develops a two-pronged, risk-based deployment strategy for financial management information systems: (1) deploy such systems to high-value transactions, and (2) use banking sector innovations for advance payments, such as smart cards or mobile money, to facilitate flexibility for low-value transactions without compromising the integrity of transactions or accountability.\n\ns_05762: Therefore, our study contributes to the understanding of how technological advances and globalization are shaping labor markets in a developing country context, providing evidence of the impacts on the demand for five different types of skills, and on labor force participation, employment, and unemployment rates, with the results disaggregated by demographic groups.\n\ns_05812: Column (2) shows the coefficient of an OLS regression of each covariate on an indicator for treatment.\n\ns_05862: where (measured at date/time t): P = Pollutant concentration measured by CAMS-3 [PM 2.5 (ug/m 3 ); NO2 (ppb)] M = Average satellite-based measure for the .01-degree cell surrounding CAMS-3 H = Average humidity (%) T = Average temperature (C) W = Average wind speed (km/hr) \u03b5 = Random error term Table 3 reports our estimation results.\n\ns_05912: It is also based on estimates of upstream linkages (the share of FVA in country exports) as well as downstream linkages (the share of DVX in county exports) for a wider range of two-digit or three-digit ISIC industries than those reported in Allard et al (2016) .\n\ns_05962: To arrive at a consensus for the tariff rate without having to average the rates within the set L, we select the tariff rate and transactions that most represent the transactions in the set.\n\ns_06012: Second, studies on mobile internet adoption tend to focus on the supply side, emphasizing technological aspects such as the efficient compression of images or data delivery (Kim and Kim 2002) .\n\ns_06062: 2 What is the current state of the literature on the size of the STM and the mechanism behind it?\n\ns_06112: The third section describes our data and empirical strategy.\n\ns_06162: In Table A.7 and Table A .8 in the Online Appendix, we check the robustness of our results relying on this alternative definition of undocumented migration.\n\ns_06212: There is scope to build on our findings.\n\ns_06262: While the general approach of obtaining the price and expenditure data remains similar, especially between the 2011 and 2017 rounds, data quality assurance has been improved with the latest available technology, particularly in the 2017 round (World Bank 2020).\n\ns_06312: The distribution of this score by age at the baseline and endline is presented in Figure 16 , and by whether the child is schooled in Figure 17 .\n\ns_06362: Table A3 reports the rates of co-residency by country for different ages.\n\ns_06412: 21 While a CRRA coecient of 1 across countries helps understand the role played by the inuence of family background on conditional variance, one might prefer to use dierent estimates of the CRRA coecient for dierent countries when the focus is on interregional and intergroup dierences within the same country.\n\ns_06462: Taken together, the analysis of the Rwandan electricity data suggests a modest increase in electricity consumption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit, non-residential electricity consumption experienced large declines."
