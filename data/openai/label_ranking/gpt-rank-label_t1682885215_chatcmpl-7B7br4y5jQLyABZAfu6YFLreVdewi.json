The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07660: Others, such as the Philippines, have engaged in Brady-type deb.\n\ns_07710: While it is very difficuilt to measure all the costs and benefits of the CIDT's policy on sequencing, the CIDT does publish the proportion of cotton of first quality by zone ( Table 5 , col. 3).\n\ns_07760: The results are: Y is now significant at a higher level whereas X is no longer as significant as in the previous equation.\n\ns_07810: The simulation results in Table 9 are quite similar to those obtained in the analysis of factor productivity discussed earlier.\n\ns_07860: This analysis aims to assess the past financial performance and standing of each of the eight project towns 8 to evaluate their potential for future financial improvement and autonomy using the available data and Management Improvement Plans (MIPs) 9 , and to measure the financial impact of the proposed investments and actions on their finances and the sustainability of their operations.\n\ns_07910: For convenience, let At -A for t 2 t* since the present value of tax depreciation allowances on gross investment is shown to be time invariant after the tax ho'iday.\n\ns_07960: The estimates of household income upon which these percentages are based are only rough approximations derived frcm answers to questions in the household questionnaire, and some of the estimates at the extremes of the frequency distributions presented in Figures 6-8 may well be due to inaccurate data.\n\ns_08010: The adoption by the Russian Federation of a deposit insurance system (DIS) in late 2003 was a significant development, although certainly not a novelty by international standards.\n\ns_08060: 15 For an in-depth discussion of the ways to design a successful means-tested direct income transfers program see Coady, Grosh and Hoddinot (2004) .\n\ns_08110: 49 For example, one of the reform options outlined by Coeure and Pisani-Ferry (2003) is organized around the concept of the \"indebtedness ratio that stabilizes net worth\".\n\ns_08160: Furthermore, while a relation between conflict and actual inequality has proven hard to document on modern evidence (see Collier and Hoeffler, 2004) , we conjecture that the introduction of the inequality possibility frontier and the extraction ratio might shed brighter light on that hypothesis.\n\ns_08210: It is intended solely to illustrate the size of potential missed opportunities that may currently exist.\n\ns_08287: 6 Institutional representatives are responsible for reporting on various content areas at three different data collection periods per year.\n\ns_08337: The IMF gives short case studies of countries but does not provide a dataset format or a list of measures per country, so the quality of the information relies on their treatment of the information and our understanding of the measures.\n\ns_08387: GERAD was supported by the Medical Research Council (Grant n\u00b0 503480), Alzheimer's Research UK (Grant n\u00b0 503176), the Wellcome Trust (Grant n\u00b0 082604/2/07/Z) and German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF): Competence Network Dementia (CND) grant n\u00b0 01GI0102, 01GI0711, 01GI0420.\n\ns_08437: So, it is very important to reduce the dimensionality of the space through feature selection.\n\ns_08487: Results from the first phase 3 study designed to confirm promising phase 2 results, unfortunately, showed no evidence of efficacy (Jones, 2010) .\n\ns_08537: More analysis could be done -and it is our hope that more researchers will use the WIC 2015 dataset and its updates for their workbased on the back-projections and some has already been realized for instance to look at the relative impact of education and demography in what is called the demographic dividend .\n\ns_08587: For a fair comparison, a linear support vector machine (SVM) [14] coupled with a widely used feature selection scheme (SVM-based Recursive Feature Elimination, or SVM-RFE [6] ) was applied in this study.\n\ns_08637: But further research is needed to better understand the number of individuals that each type of buprenorphine provider is actually treating, as well as the nature and quality of that treatment.\n\ns_08687: TIMSS-2003 has provided the participating countries in Africa with the opportunity to examine students' achievement in mathematics and science using an international yardstick and to compare this to that of other countries both within and beyond the continent of Africa.\n\ns_08737: Werner 31 used a visual analysis of the model response in the frequency domain.\n\ns_08787: Among White respondents, 41.7% reported being willing to take part in health research if given the opportunity.\n\ns_08837: We first assessed the robustness of the proposed visualization approach.\n\ns_08887: The young peer interviewers were identified by a national youth organization that had worked with the young people in the past."
