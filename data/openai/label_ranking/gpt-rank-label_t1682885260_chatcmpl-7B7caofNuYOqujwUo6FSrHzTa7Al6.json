The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08988: Ice conditions observed in 2006 are likely typical of this more traditional ice regime, as also noted by local ice experts (R. Glenn, personal communication, 2006).\n\ns_09038: This spatial weights matrix is row-standardized, and it resulted in 22.50% spatial connectivity between schools.\n\ns_09088: It clearly proves that the storm's intensity and position were accurate with the LEO satellite data, while its intensity would be weak and its position offshore without satellite data assimilations.\n\ns_09138: A convenient and natural machinery for generating diffeomorphic transformations is by the integration of ordinary differential equations (ODE) on underlying coordinate space, \u03a9 defined via the smooth time-indexed velocity vector fields v(t, y) :\ngiven by the solution of the ODE Following [6] , we use a group-wise approach and build the mean populationbased atlas,\u012a.\n\ns_09188: Specifically, a study member was any sample member who NPSAS staff determined to be eligible for the study, per the criteria delineated in section 2.1.2, and who had, at a minimum, valid data from any combination of sources for the following variables: \u2022 student type (undergraduate or graduate); \u2022 date of birth (or age); \u2022 sex; and \u2022 at least 8 of the following 15 variables: -parent education.\n\ns_09238: They found that, for the 1996 and 1997 crops, Bt cotton adoption generated large global benefits and significant benefits to US producers at the expense of producers in the ROW.\n\ns_09288: Variables for race, education, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and anemia were not significant and not included in the final model.\n\ns_09338: The analysis is facilitated with the aid of a specially designed graphical user interface.\n\ns_09388: All subjects from the 3 T dataset are also included in the 1.5 T dataset, having been scanned at 3 T less than 4 months after their 1.5 T scan.\n\ns_09438: A nonlinear relationship between BMI and AC was noticed (p=0.03), with decreased AC severity among overweight participants.\n\ns_09488: In addition to Vero E6 cells, the MA104 cell line pertaining to its suitability for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and facilitate further study of SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_09538: Lastly, chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan are considered as an essential tool in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia during this pandemic.\n\ns_09588: We examined the distributions for each effect and did not run the trim and fill procedure on data that demonstrated this type of pattern.\n\ns_09638: The analytic sample for the current study is restricted to the 5,909 respondents aged 15 to 19 who selfreported being enrolled in high school at the time of completing the time diary and for whom basic demographic variables are observed.\n\ns_09688: We evaluated our proposed method on six classification experiments, including (1) AD vs. CU, (2) AD vs. LMCI, (3) AD vs. EMCI, (4) LMCI vs. CU, (5) EMCI vs. CU and (6) LMCI vs. EMCI.\n\ns_09738: Our analysis focused on those students who responded to the question about their age 30 career expectation as eighth graders in 1988 and who also obtained baccalaureate degrees from 4-year colleges or universities by 2000.\n\ns_09788: Therefore, the present study aimed to propose a novel framework with a deep neural network based on DBN, which can effectively learn the patterns of metabolic changes between MCI converters and nonconverters using FDG-PET images.\n\ns_09838: For instance, Ramnarain (2014) examined the effectiveness of the strategies-based problem-solving approach on the problem-solving performance of grade nine mathematics classes in South African schools.\n\ns_09888: In this investigation, we use a random selection of 60% of patients for our training data, 20% for validation and the final 20% for evaluation as per the CF tests.\n\ns_09938: It is increasingly recognized that a country's overseas nationals, and even those who claim distant ancestral heritage, can be a valuable economic asset (see e.g., Rauch, 2001, and Saxenian 2002) .\n\ns_09988: Let us see if this pattern persists for the high school level.\n\ns_00040: When the number of observations is different from the number of unique subjects, data were acquired on a subject more than one time.\n\ns_00090: The results from the disaggregated racial/ethnicity analysis presents a very similar picture across all four demographic groups, although the impact to African-American students appeared to be somewhat less than for Latino/a students (further research examining this differential impact of HSSLRAs for Latino/a(s) and African-American students appears to be warranted).\n\ns_00140: This study suffered from several important limitations that are typical of quantitative research on teenage fatherhood.\n\ns_00190: The clinically-acquired dataset contains T2-FLAIR MR scans acquired within 48 hours of stroke onset."
