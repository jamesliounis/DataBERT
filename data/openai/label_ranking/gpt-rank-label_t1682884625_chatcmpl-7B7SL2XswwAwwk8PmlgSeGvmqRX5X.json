The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03895: Finally impacts of changes in fisheries were examined but it was not possible to value these in monetary terms due to gaps in the data.\n\ns_03945: Average values of the variables for each country are reported in Table A1 in the Annex, while overall averages and other descriptive statistics are reported in Table A6 in the Annex.\n\ns_03995: where w ti is a vector of woman's initial conditions, including region of residence, schooling level, age of marriage, whether she is married to a polygamous husband, year of birth, and the number of children she had in the rst period observed interacted with the age she was when rst observed.\n\ns_04045: Table 5 shows the Pearson correlations between the (negative of the) concentration index for under-five mortality, various measures of income per capita, income inequality and the share of health spending publicly financed.\n\ns_04095: Thus, in the unlikely event that they became available, long-term data would be very difficult to interpret.\n\ns_04145: The data 15 Our merged data set comprises both financial and non-financial firms.\n\ns_04195: From equations (A5) and (A6), it can be readily established that all the results summarized in propositions 1 and 2 given in the text continue to hold.\n\ns_04245: The paper is written in an abstract form, to lay bare as clearly as possible, the microeconomic basis and game-theoretic structure of our argument.\n\ns_04295: Enders (2010) advocates forecast error variance decomposition to confirm the results from the above impulse response analysis.\n\ns_04345: In trying to identify the local spillover effect \u03b1 in 5 The characteristics of a valid instrument in this context are that it be correlated with the number of pupils who choose a given school, but not correlated with the unobserved fixed attributes of that school.\n\ns_04395: The last three columns of Table 2 investigate the robustness of our results by replicating the estimation of column 4.\n\ns_04445: This paper also contributes to a second, related literature, which examines the role of soft and hard commitments on financial decisions.\n\ns_04495: The second, and probably most detailed, set of explanations for downward wage rigidity can be found in the efficiency wage literature, which therefore motivates a number of the survey questions.\n\ns_04545: 's (2009) partitioning of influences on outcomes into illegitimate and legitimate.\n\ns_04595: 7 8 As discussed in detail in AG (2010, 2012), F E G provides a convenient way to identify unanticipated government purchases, which enables us to appropriately estimate \u2026scal multipliers.\n\ns_04645: Sections 4 and 5 present the main results and discussions, while Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\ns_04695: This suggests that the greenfield FDI data that we use in this paper are not affected by gross inconsistencies and are potentially representative of trends in both greenfield and M&A FDI.\n\ns_04745: The samples to explore how the HSAA might have affected generation III girls' outcomes either directly or by empowering their (generation II) mothers, differ slightly from each other due to different age cut-offs.\n\ns_04795: In this section we first discuss the Thai macro dynamic data that will be used to calibrate the model and then discuss some issues concerning the calibration itself.\n\ns_04845: However the coefficient does gain significance at higher lags of the spending variables, giving some support for the \"prosperity-pull\" hypothesis.\n\ns_04895: is used, in which ) , ( \uf06c \uf062\n\ns_04945: We therefore also estimated a version of equation 5that included urbanization and population density to capture the density effect and its impact on demand (both direct and through price.)\n\ns_04995: In the last two rows, instead of using the standard REER and gross exports, we regress value-added exports on two measures of the REER corrected for GVC participation taken from Bayoumi et al.\n\ns_05045: Results of the estimation of the multinomial logit explaining survival, entry, and continuous nonexporter status relative to exit (the worst transition in our setup) appear in the first three columns of Table 3 .\n\ns_05095: This process generates an exact, additive decomposition of the D-index into the contributions of different individual circumstances or groups of circumstances (Shorrocks, 2013) ."
