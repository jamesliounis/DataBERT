The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02098: Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of gastric cancer in Central America based upon the available data and with comparison to Hispanics living in the USA.\n\ns_02148: Table 4 highlights the details of these co-cited papers at trim level 3 which identifies top 10 cocited papers.\n\ns_02198: In a longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling older adults (N=139, mean age=81.6, 58% female, 58% white, mean follow-up=3.4 years), we estimated the overall and sex-stratified effects of BDNF val66met polymorphism on changes in cognition and gray and white matter macroand micro-structure.\n\ns_02231: Although the sample was reduced as a result, the estimates of the associations were comparable with those based on the full sample.\n\ns_02281: 2.5.1 User Defined Facilities UDF data at the building level were obtained from FEMA's CommunityViz project for New York City.\n\ns_02331: All models included the following covariates: age at baseline, sex, education, hyperglycemia status, ApoE e4 genotype, and mean regional GM within the ROI examined.\n\ns_02381: 719 doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013470.\n\ns_02431: 16 documenting primary care's cost savings, Colla et al.\n\ns_02481: To ensure accurate inferences were being made in empirical data, we set a threshold for sample inclusion based on the proportion of genome masked.\n\ns_02531: The results should be interpreted with caution if selectivity effects are important.\n\ns_02581: Quantitative data was analyzed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests, and data measured on a dichotomous scale were analyzed using a chi-square test of independence with Yates' correction.\n\ns_02631: In fact, in a study by Geerlings et al.\n\ns_02681: Indeed, using the SAT data, we calculate that well over half of blacks with SATs above 1500 send their scores-a proxy for application-to Harvard alone.\n\ns_02731: Concurrently, the Science and Information Branch, Land Information Ontario, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, has developed satellite derived land cover data for similar dates (1992 and 2000 respectively), but only for areas on the Canadian Shield for the later date (Spectranalysis Inc., unpublished data).\n\ns_02781: Finally, we repeated all analyses using complex sample weights.\n\ns_02831: 2010; Gregory and Rimm-Kaufman 2008) .\n\ns_02881: The results will aid in determining what proportion of the population under the most optimistic scenario is willing to and actually does respond to long, complex household surveys using the Internet.\n\ns_02931: Since the student is the unit of analysis and the teacher data wae merpd with the students', the soume of data for these tables and figures is repwted as being from both the sturkat and teacher surveys.\n\ns_02981: In addition, the data comparison strategy (Yin, 2014), triangulation of data sources (Yin, 2014; Stake, 1995) , and a study validation method (Stake, 1995) were used.\n\ns_03031: The inter-rater reliability versus the reference standard tracing ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 at 3T, and from 0.82 to 0.97 at 1.5T scanners (Supplementary Table 1 , inter-rater reliability versus reference).\n\ns_03081: Based on the results of the initial model and the descriptive statistics of the variables, a second model was estimated only including those variables at least minimally significant in the original logit model or strongly suggested in the literature.\n\ns_03131: List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean(2006) \u2026nd evidence for the e\u00a4ect of deliberation on preferences.\n\ns_03181: See Wright and Williams (1984) .\n\ns_03231: This paper marries these two literatures.\n\ns_03281: The data for the construction of the dummy variable come from banks that were directly exposed to Lehman suffered a large relative decline in their returns, of about one percentage point in a single day."
