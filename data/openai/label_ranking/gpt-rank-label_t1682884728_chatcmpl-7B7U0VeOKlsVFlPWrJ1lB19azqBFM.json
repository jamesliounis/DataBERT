The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08774: 9,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] However, the findings are consistent with a small number of more recent studies that document a willingness to participate among racial and ethnic minorities.\n\ns_08824: The model selection procedure, including model architecture selection and training hyperparameter fine-tuning, was performed using only the training/validation dataset.\n\ns_08874: In our 2014 web survey, we asked young people what they think it takes to get ahead in life, and as Figure 2 illustrates, hard work, ambition and 'having an education yourself' were the attributes that were most frequently seen to be 'essential' or 'very important' (83%, 82% and 79%, respectively).\n\ns_08924: This can be shown analytically (West and Shlesinger 1989) and graphically (Fig.\n\ns_08974: [12] Our measurements at Barrow [Druckenmiller et al., 2009] show that ice thickness of level nearshore ice increases from 0.6 to 0.8 m in January to reach its maximum of 1.4 to 1.6 m in mid-May.\n\ns_09024: In Model 2, we see that a one-percentage point increase in the nearest 45 high schools that have an open campus policy is significantly associated with a 6.2% increase in the odds of the focal school within that organizational environment having an open campus policy (OR = 1.062; 95% CI = 1.036 to 1.088).\n\ns_09074: A flowchart of rules in the Dvorak method was created to consistently generate subjective estimates of TC intensity from the structural cues in satellite imagery.\n\ns_09124: We use Partial Least Squares as a supervised dimensionality-reduction technique to fuse the weighted combination of the two imaging modalities together with the clinical information.\n\ns_09174: Staff conducted analyses to identify potential data quality problems, refine implementation procedures, and learn how respondents were likely to answer new questions in the full-scale collection.\n\ns_09224: As shown in Table 1, the range of differences in yield between Bt and conventional cotton is quite large, mostly because of the wide range of pest incidence in the years since the commercial introduction of Bt cotton.\n\ns_09274: Formal tests of the difference in activity counts between the youngest (group 1) and the oldest age groups (group 4) were insignificant at 8 am (t test: p = .13), but were highly significant at 9 am (t test: p < .001), 12 pm (t test = p < .001), and 6 pm (t test = p < .001).\n\ns_09324: Therefore, in this paper, we introduce four correlation parameters to measure and analyze correlations of atrophy rate between hippocampus and ventricles.\n\ns_09374: These findings are consistent with the observation from the plots in Figs.\n\ns_09424: Results were consistent even after accounting for variables with significant univariate associations with AC and known to potentially affect vascular calcification and bone density, including physical activity, blood levels of vitamin D and calcium, use of vitamin D supplements and bisphosphonates (Table 2, Model 3).\n\ns_09474: However, the sequence comparison showed that both sequences carry key Iranian cluster mutations including G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T.\n\ns_09524: Further, another study revealed that treatment of COVID-19 patients having ARDS, with steroids significantly decreased the mortality rate compared to those that did not receive steroids (46% vs 68%) [100] .\n\ns_09574: Finally, Roberts, Robins, Caspi, and Trzesniewski (2003) reviewed a more comprehensive list of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies than previously captured in narrative reviews.\n\ns_09624: The implications of the limited nature of the ELS homework variable are discussed in the methodology section.\n\ns_09674: In this paper, we presented a spherical sparse coding framework, applied it to study cortical thickness feature reduction problem, and evaluated our method on the ADNI2 dataset to check its classification performance.\n\ns_09724: Designed and conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), NELS:88 began in 1988 with a survey of 24,599 eighth graders.\n\ns_09774: The feature vector mapping of the DBN is optimized, and the size of the input apace is simplified.\n\ns_09824: In addition, the results of this study were consistent with that of Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.\n\ns_09874: To obtain these measures, we apply the Monte-Carlo dropout approach of [3] by approximating the posterior over network weights as:\nWhere we draw J samples\u0174 j using feed-forward passes through the network with the same dropout mask applied across time-steps.\n\ns_09924: Studies of the graduates of the elite Indian Institutes of\nTechnology provide a good illustration of this concern.\n\ns_09974: The study uses linear regression for multiple variables with equations stated as follows:\n1. c4 = c5 +c2 -c3 where c4 = 92.9 -0.00014 c5 +0.276 c2-0.337 c3\nThis can be represented as a 3. c4 = c5+ c2 -c3 where c4 = 13.0 +0.000437c5 +1.89c2-0.541c3\nThis can be represented as a Table 4 : Lowest paying school districts (high school teachers) OLS estimates."
