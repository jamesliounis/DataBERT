The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09362: Other studies showed that volumes of medial temporal lobe regions computed using NeuroQuant exhibit statistically significant differences between early AD patients and controls (Brewer et al., 2008) and correlate with clinical scores (Kovacevic et al., 2009) .\n\ns_09412: The trends of the variables presented in Table 1 did not significantly differ when considering women and men separately, although statistical significance was lost in some sub-analyses most likely due to the smaller sample size (see Supplemental Table S1 ).\n\ns_09462: The quality of the raw data was evaluated by FastQC v.0.11.5 (Babraham Bioinformatics) and low-quality bases, primers and remnant adapters were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.32 [24] .\n\ns_09512: This review, focusses on current incidence, etiopathogenesis, clinical characteristics with multiorgan involvements associated infections, diagnostic criteria's, its management and present and future prospects of clinical trials to prevent, manage and control COVID-19.\n\ns_09562: To examine the relationships between the moderator variables and the effect sizes, we first created data sets for each trait category that included as many nonoverlapping studies as possible.\n\ns_09612: Panel A of Table 1 summarizes the homework time of students in the analytic sample both overall and by gender.\n\ns_09662: Table 2 shows classification performance on six different experiments.\n\ns_09712: In the NELS:88 sampling design, two analytical issues require special attention: (i) the effect of purposeful\n\ns_09762: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans acquired at the baseline visit were used in the present analysis.\n\ns_09812: In particular, the study aims to answer the following two questions.\n\ns_09862: KDD '18, August 2018, London, UK \u00a9 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\n\ns_09912: 10 Dobson et al., 2001 ).\n\ns_09962: They must publish the average results for all students, as well as the results broken down by ethnic groups and other subsets.\n\ns_00014: When data is received from a laboratory it is assembled in a collection listed in the Data from Labs section of the website.\n\ns_00064: The predictor and control variables included in the analysis are listed in Table 1 .\n\ns_00114: We report significant differences at the p < .10 level, but because more cautious readers may prefer to focus only on results that are significant at p < .05 and below, we label marginally significant findings in the text.\n\ns_00164: For the clinically-acquired stroke dataset, we compare our method to VoxelMorph (VM) [7] , Patch Based Registration (PBR) [13] , and the widely used Advanced Normalization Tools software package (ANTs) [4] .\n\ns_00214: Within these indicators, the number of deaths per million inhabitants turned out to be one of the preferred ones to generate a ranking of the most affected countries.\n\ns_00261: Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between multidomain MCI and amnestic MCI, and development of dementia (GDS score \u2265 4) after 2 years ( table 3 ) .\n\ns_00311: 62 By enrolling men also from Sweden and Hong Kong, the study has reached a considerable number of participants ( Table 2 ).\n\ns_00361: The FRIS data also contain state-scale information on the types of fuel used to power wells, so relative use of diesel, gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and propane was calculated at the regional scale, and standard conversions from diesel to other fuel types were used to calculate the quantity of each fuel type needed to pump a hectare-meter of water, given regional well characteristics.\n\ns_00411: The analysis performed in this study is based on the DIAN cohort using PiB as the imaging tracer.\n\ns_00461: Korea (the top performing country) and Turkey (the focus of the study) were selected for analyses in this study to show how a DINA model can be used to obtain fine-grained information about the performances of the students from these two countries.\n\ns_00511: We created current predictions and future projections of probability of occurrence to each grid cell, for each focal species, by applying the SDMs to the baseline land cover and climate data (the 20-year period for baseline climate data being [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] and to baseline land cover and future climate data (the 10-year period 2040-2049).\n\ns_00561: The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease study (Murray et al., 2013) showed that brain disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States; they are also the largest cause of financial loss due to noncommunicable disease."
