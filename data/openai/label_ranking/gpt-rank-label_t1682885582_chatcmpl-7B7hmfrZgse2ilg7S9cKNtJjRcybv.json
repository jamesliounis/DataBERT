The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02086: The AI system performed better for diagnosing infected patients who tested positive for RT-PCR but showed normal CT scans.\n\ns_02136: For reported data, non-cardia gastric cancer was far more common in Central America (83.3 %, n=6904/8285), among US Hispanics (80.2 %, n=4413/5501) and among Hispanics born in Central America (86.3 %, n=746/864).\n\ns_02186: Word cloud provides a high visual representation of concepts that a paper had frequently applied.\n\ns_02269: These results support the hypothesis that WMHs, as a measure of vascular pathology and vascular burden, are associated with frontal lobe dysfunction rather than dysfunction in those brain regions more closely linked to AD neurodegeneration.\n\ns_02319: All sea levels rise projections are measured relative to the 1983-2001 base period, and are based on recent projections from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (Horton et al., 2015).\n\ns_02369: Three findings were of particular interest: First, in MCI-P participants, higher HOMA-IR predicted hypermetabolism in the hippocampus and MTL.\n\ns_02419: 692 Warner, J.C., Armstrong, B., He, R., & Zambon, J.B. (2010).\n\ns_02469: 3 Studies have attempted to characterize patient and regional characteristics associated with unnecessary services, often referred to as low value care (LVC).\n\ns_02519: As we were interested in studying potential positive selection beyond the time points investigated in the GISAID samples, we selected an England reference genome to call variants using a virus that harboured the known fixed D614G haplotype.\n\ns_02569: A quantile regression for the demand by organic farmers for consultations with private information providers is estimated.\n\ns_02619: [60] , male Wistar rats fed a diet enriched with cholesterol (4%) and cholic acid (1%) demonstrated not only altered blood lipid levels, but were also characterized by a hyperplastic prostate.\n\ns_02669: Likewise, the HPA axis abnormalities associated with depression may persist even after remission (Lok et al., 2012; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) , possibly constituting trait rather than state markers for depression, even though this remains a matter of debate (Zverova et al., 2013; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .\n\ns_02719: These shares are shown in rows (4) and (5) of Table 1 , first without and then with expected income convergence (which may involve some double counting, as part of past test score convergence may be attributable to income changes).\n\ns_02769: This is the first high resolution land cover change product ever produced for the nation at a 30 meter spatial resolution.\n\ns_02819: For all 3 outcomes, 3-way interaction terms with race/ethnicity were not significant, and there was no significant interaction between GA and household SES in any racial/ethnic group in analyses stratified by race/ethnicity.\n\ns_02869: The present study had three goals.\n\ns_02919: The ability to better identify specific types of technical problems will help researchers overcome some of the issues related to online surveys.\n\ns_02969: However, the nature of the error depends upon the sample design, and the error properties of many types of sample designs (including two-stage designs such as the one used in this stixly) are known.\n\ns_03019: Given that n (population) = 32, confidence interval = 7.18, and e = 0.1, if\n\ns_03069: Moreover, FTD were mainly men than AD patients (p = 0.003, Table 1 ).\n\ns_03119: Table 4 displays the estimated odds ratios based on the estimated coefficients for each variable.\n\ns_03169: By matching proceedings within transcripts of gram sabhas with the preferences of villagers we are able to see whose voices are heard, whose priorities are mentioned, and how institutions a\u00a4ect deliberative dominance by elites.\n\ns_03219: To comprehend these distributional effects, it is necessary to recognize the dynamic nature of the problem and the importance of private responses to public actions.\n\ns_03269: [Insert Table 5 about here]\n\ns_03319: (1) 2(3) (4) Panel B -Complete sample summary statistics for the ratio of retail deposits to liabilities."
