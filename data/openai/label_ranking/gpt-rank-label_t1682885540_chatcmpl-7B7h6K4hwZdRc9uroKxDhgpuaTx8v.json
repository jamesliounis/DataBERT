The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00735: also 2NCLAN studies which include ozone exposures far above and far is to b t c i te s o i below ambient levels often report non-linear yield-exposure relation-ozone relationships in Southern California.\n\ns_00785: Recently, several studies have utilized the original Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to extend analysis a grade earlier by examining science achievement gaps in the third grade (Kohlhaas, Lin, & Chu, 2010;Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & MacZuga, 2016;Quinn & Cooc, 2015).\n\ns_00835: At the core of the framework (Figure 1 ) was improved academic outcomes in the school district.\n\ns_00885: Territory and nest-site fidelity is common for Ferruginous Hawks, and one of several nests within a territory may be used in alternate years (Davy, 1930; Weston, 1968; Olendorff, 1973; Blair, 1978; Smith and Murphy, 1978; Roth and Marzluff, 1989; Schmutz, 1991b; De Smet, 1992; Houston, 1995) .\n\ns_00935: Besides classification, our proposed method is also a better fit for regression studies of AD associated clinical score estimation than simple metric regression, since most of the clinical score measures, e.g., mini mental state examination (MMSE), are not continuous variables.\n\ns_00985: It is unclear at present what is the magnitude of each of these mechanisms.\n\ns_01035: In its current form the tool PMP calculates amongst others the required pressurization gas mass, pressure losses throughout the propellant feed system, pressure at all locations, and it includes a simple method for the determination of evaporated propellant mass and self-pressurization.\n\ns_01085: The results also show that similar life-cycle trends are followed by the five household types.\n\ns_01135: As discussed previously, we also estimated a series of models that looked at the three dimensions of the CLASS (both simultaneously and separately) and found that our results were not driven by any one dimension of the measure.\n\ns_01185: As demonstrated in the simulation of Hurricane Rita (2005), whether a Fig.\n\ns_01235: Clinical trials in AD should not exclude participants based on the severity of cognitive impairment, but include the severity as a moderator of treatment effects in analysis.\n\ns_01285: To address the skills gaps which exists and exacerbates the digital divide, this study firstly seeks to identify the core disciplines of digital literacy required in the modern digital economy.\n\ns_01335: A number of studies showed that comorbid anxiety, mood, and substance disorders were more common among some depressive [22, 33] and panic [34] subtypes than others.\n\ns_01385: This is in part explained by the use of univariate analytical techniques, small samples and lack of statistical power, lack of external validation of potential biomarkers, and lack of integration of nonimaging measures (eg, genetic, clinical, cognitive data).\n\ns_01435: NOAA Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST data (Version 4.1) are used in constructing a new SST dataset (called the reconstructed SST data) for CEOF analysis.\n\ns_01485: First, NIH does not retain information about coinvestigators in its applicant data system.\n\ns_01535: Th e results showed that simulated annual irrigated water amounts were in good agreement with the FRIS data in the Southwest and Mid-South during the survey years.\n\ns_01585: Figure 7 (b) presents the computed currents and water elevations driven by the wave field shown in Figure 7 (a), tides, river floods, in which the breaching and the overbank flooding were predicted at the rivermouth bar.\n\ns_01635: This underscores the potential utility of genomic epidemiology to link individuals with incomplete information (e.g.\n\ns_01685: This result was perhaps to be expected based on the different mechanisms of the two methods, with VBM quantifying local GM density and its change over time, while SIENA-R measures displacement of the local brain-non-brain boundary.\n\ns_01735: Patients in whom mcGTC has been diagnosed are at an increased risk (P\\.05) for subsequent diagnosis of either renal (93.03 per 10,000 person-years [PYs]) or pancreatic cancer (89.56 per 10,000 PYs) from 60 to 119 months thereafter compared with the general population.\n\ns_01785: In particular, the proposed method performs especially effectively when correlations among covariates are as strong as 0.8, with FNR+FPR = 0.251, much smaller than any FNR+FPR of other methods.\n\ns_01835: While it is not clear what these covariates may be, they provide scientific insights into future mortality studies as researchers could explore what factors correspond to these spatial patterns [49] .\n\ns_01885: institution F3SEC2A1 Frequencies for this variable were created with F3QWT.\n\ns_01935: Although the different clinical centers have used their own identifiers (IDs) historically, each subject in the database has been assigned a unique universal anonymized ID (IN-DDID)."
