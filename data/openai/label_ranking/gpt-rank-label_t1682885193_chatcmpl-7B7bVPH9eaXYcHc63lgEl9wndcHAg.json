The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01377: This might in part be explained by (1) differences in the sociodemographic (eg, age, ethnicity, migration, socioeconomic status) and clinical features of the samples studied, which often reflect inter-site differences in catchment area populations, type of early detection and intervention services involved, and potential sampling biases (particularly in CHR-P individuals 25 ); (2) the use of relatively small samples, which might result in type I and type II errors 26 and therefore limited generalizability of the findings; (3) heterogeneous image preprocessing protocols; and lastly (4) the use of different inclusion criteria in different studies, leading to substantial heterogeneity in symptom severity and comorbidities.\n\ns_01427: Shortening of the temporal variability in the 1990s has also been discussed in earlier studies (Chu et al., 1998; Hirose and Ostrovskii, 2000; Morimoto and Yanagi, 2001; Minobe et al., 2004) .\n\ns_01477: In particular, women are less likely to be employed in the major research universities, where most research grants are awarded.\n\ns_01527: We fi rst acquired the USDA data archive to defi ne where and when cotton grows and whether it is irrigated.\n\ns_01577: Figure 7 (a) and (b) show respectively a computed wave field (significant wave heights and mean directions) and currents at the time of the peak flood (t=12 h).\n\ns_01627: The introductions post-peak occurred for the most part from South American countries.\n\ns_01677: Therefore, a test dataset should not be restricted to simulated images based on healthy control data, but should also include real patient data.\n\ns_01727: CI, Confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\n\ns_01777: Suppose that all the covariates in X are from S sources where the k-th source contains p k covariates for k = 1, .\n\ns_01827: Specifically, the results in Table 2 suggested that higher levels of isolation between non-Hispanic whites and these two minority groups are associated with lower levels of mortality in US counties.\n\ns_01877: For more information about the NEB and other Data Analysis Systems, consult the NCES DAS website (www.nces.ed.gov/das) or its West Coast mirror site (www.pedar-das.org), or contact: Internet address: Aurora_D'Amico@ed.gov\n\ns_01927: In addition, biosamples are available to outside investigators (for complete details, see [e23] ).\n\ns_01977: The total response rate was 2501 and after several exclusions were applied concerning data quality control (please see above methods section) the final effective sample size was 1989 participants.\n\ns_02027: The mean for the instrumentalists for the average KS4 points score was 48.48 (SD = 5.37), total points for all KS4 examinations 551.6 (SD = 125.1) and capped score for the best eight examinations 400.76 (SD = 48.46).\n\ns_02077: A clinical study demonstrated that the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor showed comparable efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with that of a pre-existing condition of inflammatory bowel disease patients.\n\ns_02127: Purpose The aims of this study were to delineate the epidemiology of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and contrast it with Hispanic-Latino populations in the USA.\n\ns_02177: Further analysis of research activity of the ten identified countries was done using altmetric and citation analysis.\n\ns_02260: Patients with MCI were selected for the present study and included those with FDG-PET imaging.\n\ns_02310: The raster type file is provided in the UTM18N projection and is compatible with most open source and commercial desktop GIS packages.\n\ns_02360: However, significant interactions were found between the baseline diagnosis and HOMA-IR in all ROIs as well as interactions between MCI conversion and HOMA-IR for temporal and frontal areas.\n\ns_02410: 197 from 11 grid cells at the river mouth to obtain statistical information on drifter tracks They are\n\ns_02460: We also included ZCTAlevel socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of practice location to adjust for differences in communities they serve.\n\ns_02510: We then aligned each sequence to the Wuhan reference genome (NCBI RefSeq: NC_045512) using a Needleman-Wunsch rapid global alignment implemented in EMBOSS stretcher (default settings).\n\ns_02560: To motivate the approach, Figure 1 plots the number of visits that organic producers make to private information providers as a function of the farmer's organic acreage.\n\ns_02610: Their experiment suggests that atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is one of the diagnostic indicators of MetS, has an impact on the growth of the prostate."
