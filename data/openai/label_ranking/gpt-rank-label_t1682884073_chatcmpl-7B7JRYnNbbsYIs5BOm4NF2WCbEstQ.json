The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00701: Th\nCross-sectional data on yields and management practices come from the USDA 1990 Cropping Yield functions were estimated from a cross sec-Practices Survey.\n\ns_00751: In particular, we standardized the measures within each year using sampling weights and survey settings to account for the complex sampling design of the ECLS-K:2011.\n\ns_00801: South Africa was ranked the lowest amongst 50 countries in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) undertaken in 2003 (Letseka et al., 2012) .\n\ns_00851: Artificial nest platforms are an effective tool for improving breeding success where loss of natural nest substrates has occurred (Wallace and others, 2016; Ng and others, 2017; Wiggins and others, 2017) .\n\ns_00901: 1b , has been adopted widely since its invention (He et al., 2016) and achieved promising performance in many challenging pattern recognition tasks.\n\ns_00951: Furthermore, the wind dataset has a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and sea surface height have a time resolution of 1 day.\n\ns_01001: The input data of PMP consists of two parts; a mission specific part and a propellant system specific part.\n\ns_01051: Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore provided various statistics on family finances of households and examined changes in finances between 1998 and 2001.\n\ns_01101: We then probed the interactions using simple slopes to determine whether the influences of the predictor varied significantly at different levels of the moderator.\n\ns_01151: Since the GOES data are available only at the initial time, they have little impact on the forecast beyond 36 h. Thus, nearly all of the improvements at the longer forecast intervals are due to the TCHP because that input is averaged along the storm track.\n\ns_01201: A model was constructed with group effect, visit effect, and group by visit interactions, with age and education as covariates.\n\ns_01251: In light of this challenge, the second phase of the literature review involved reviewing studies produced by international bodies between 2010 and 2016.\n\ns_01301: These studies typically used latent class growth, semi-parametric group-based modeling, or other techniques to identify distinct trajectories according to the inferential goal of the analysis [77, 78] .\n\ns_01351: 46 Studies have employed structural 44 and functional MRI data 47 but also nonimaging data 41 to make predictions on broadly 3 areas: diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment.\n\ns_01401: The JES subset data comprise 3116 seagrid points and 824 samples after masking land-grid points.\n\ns_01451: Finally, we note numerous limitations in the information collected in federal agencies' grant application and award data systems.\n\ns_01501: Signifi cant correlations were simulated by the redeveloped and original GOSSYM in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively.\n\ns_01551: (2008) presented a comprehensive review about sediment transport modeling and gave valuable suggestions on future model development for simulation of morphodynamic processes in rivers, coasts, and estuaries.\n\ns_01601: The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. .\n\ns_01651: The availability of two consecutively acquired MP-RAGE scans provides an opportunity to study the reproducibility of methods [98] , and including similar scan-rescan data in an MS test dataset would be highly desirable.\n\ns_01701: However, the multivariable analyses revealed that surgical management of disease improves DSS by 5.34 years (3.39-28.52).\n\ns_01751: Alternatively, the direct sparse regression procedure using covariance from multi-modality data (DIS-COM) [53] estimates the covariance matrices among predictors and between the response and predictors.\n\ns_01801: Comparing with the findings in Table 2 , two Segregation Dimensions, Race/Ethnicity, and Mortality additional eigenvectors, 21 and 17, were identified and they were shown in Fig 3.\n\ns_01851: Table C2 presents the comparison of the selected students from the two data sets based on students' sex, raceethnicity, and age.\n\ns_01901: Sample information-such as source, quality, quantity, and storage location-is uploaded into the Progeny database and linked to the individual in the database."
