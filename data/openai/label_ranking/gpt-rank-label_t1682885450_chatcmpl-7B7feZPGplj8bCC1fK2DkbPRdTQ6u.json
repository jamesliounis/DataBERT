The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09242: They found significant aggregate net benefits to farmers and much smaller benefits to the seed companies and research institutes/companies.\n\ns_09292: In Figure 2A , the red line represents an unadjusted linear regression fit and the blue line represents a smooth nonparametric fit.\n\ns_09342: A better solution, that keeps both high accuracy and the simultaneous optimal accuracy for AD, NL and overall data, was obtained by the SVM method with a Quadratic kernel function.\n\ns_09392: Consistently with previous work on classification in AD, we used support vector machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) as implemented in LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) to respectively perform automatic classification of AD patients vs healthy controls, MCI patients vs healthy controls, AD vs MCI patients, and early vs late AD converters among MCI patients.\n\ns_09442: We confirmed the inverse relationship between BMD and AC reported in previous studies (reviewed by Persy and colleagues 1 ).\n\ns_09492: In this study, we isolated the SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Turkey with confirmed COVID-19.\n\ns_09542: Rapid PCR by cartridge system (CBNAAT) are also available which are equally efficient and has significantly short response time [104] .\n\ns_09592: We used various statistics from the studies to estimate the standardized mean difference scores.\n\ns_09642: Accordingly, the current study investigates the distribution of SES and gender gaps in effort put forth outside the traditional schoolday, as measured by secondary school students' non- The ATUS time diaries are the ideal instruments with which to measure homework time, as time diaries are relatively robust to social desirability bias (Juster & Stafford, 1991) and contain information on participation in other activities that may \"crowd out\" homework.\n\ns_09692: It means the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive example is higher than a randomly chosen negative example and indicates that we may have learned a good classifier.\n\ns_09742: Here, the estimated probability of the student who expected a science-related future career was 51%, whereas the estimated probability of the student who expected a nonscience career was 19%.\n\ns_09792: Each column represents a single sample, and each row represents the same ROI from the regiongrowing algorithm.\n\ns_09842: In the final phase, a post-test was implemented to explore the development in participants' problem-solving strategies.\n\ns_09892: To evaluate predictions of the event-of-interest -i.e.\n\ns_09942: For example, if a firm dealing in the US with Indian engineers from the elite IITs, show them to be excellently trained, this experience can lead to upward revision of priors about the quality of Indian engineers in India from these institutions, and possibly other institutions as well.\n\ns_09992: At the other side of the correlation is the percent of students meeting or exceeding state standards.\n\ns_00044: Specific instruction on the use of the data dictionary is available in the tutorials section of the NDAR website.\n\ns_00094: Research has found that such programs can bolster student science self-identity and self-efficacy (Hunter et al., 2006; Bakken et al., 2010; Herrera and Hurtado, 2011) and provide much-needed mentorship, support, and motivation (Chubin et al., 2009; Rohrbaugh and Corces, 2011) .\n\ns_00144: In Table 1, the two domains of fathers' influences on children that differed between teenage and adult fathers most consistently and in the expected direction were the child's household context and the father-mother relationship (operationalized as coresidence and marital status).\n\ns_00194: In both cases, the sparse cross correlation function outperforms the standard cross correlation function.\n\ns_00244: However, there has been less emphasis in death rates attributed to COVID-19.\n\ns_00291: The Gothenburg-Oslo MCI Study (GO-MCI) includes mainly patients in their mid-60s with MCI broadly defined as subjective or objective cognitive impairment.\n\ns_00341: For some studies methods for T assay varied overtime during the long period of study protocol;^UK, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Sweden, Spain, Hungary, Estonia; EU: European;^^The main end point to be investigated in relation to aging; PLOC-B: Prospective, Longitudinal, Observational, Community-Based Study; MC-PLOC-B: MultiCenter, Prospective, Longitudinal, Observational, Community-Based Study; P-BRT: Population-Based, Randomized, Trial; n.d.: not detectable at any analysis; CV: cardiovascular; ED: erectile dysfunction.\n\ns_00391: Nationwide reductions in annual nutrient discharges associated with a 50% adoption of WSIN are estimated to range from 282,000 to 603,000 kg for N and from 182,000 to 378,000 kg for P. Nitrogen and especially P values are likely to be underestimated in Table 5 because the baseline values that were used were based on data related to ornamental growers in Maryland, which operate under relatively strict nutrient discharge limits to reduce environmental impacts to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\ns_00441: We focused our comparison of quantification methodology on those utilizing structural MR obtained on the same participant."
