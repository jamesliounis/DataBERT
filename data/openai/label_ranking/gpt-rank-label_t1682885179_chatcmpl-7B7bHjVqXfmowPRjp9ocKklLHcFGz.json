The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06359: Recent studies have used household and public opinion surveys with retrospective information about parents' education to document the levels of IGM in education in LAC at the country level (for an example, see Hertz et al., 2007; Narayan et al., 2018; Neidh\u00f6fer, Serrano, & Gasparini, 2018) .\n\ns_06409: We also report the summary statistics for our four main sub-samples: urban, rural, sons, and daughters in the following panels respectively.\n\ns_06459: Similar to the analysis in Section 5.1, we begin by looking at the average effects of the pandemic on electricity consumption in Ghana, estimated separately for the various user groups, as shown in Table 6 .\n\ns_06509: 14 For the purpose of the estimation, we employed the Logit command in Stata 16.\n\ns_06559: Middle-income countries tend to have a range of adoption of virtual tools in between the range for high and low-income countries.\n\ns_06609: By doing so, it was possible to test and obtain some estimates of the savings in computing time and cost when the short-cut in this study, i.e., the method of separate solution of the price and quantity modules, was implemented.\n\ns_06659: The \"head institution\" in any situation would depend on the precise nature of the problem.\n\ns_06709: Since capital flows are assumed to affect real variables indirectly through their effect on interest rates and the availability of credit, the inclusion of these variables in the regression would be expected to reduce the coefficient on capital flows.\n\ns_06759: However, the impact of credit on female empowerment, or a reduction in 'female vulnerability' has also received considerable attention.\n\ns_06809: Although the empirical literature has found significant support for the idea that domestic and foreign lobbying are important determinants of trade policy in the United States, it still faces an important puzzle: most estimates of the weight granted to social welfare relative to lobbying contributions in the US government's objective function are extremely high: generally above 100.\n\ns_06859: One reason is that data for tangible assets are more easily collected and available.\n\ns_06909: 10 The poverty rate is the most recent estimate provided it is no earlier than 1995 (the median survey year is 1999), though the poverty data predate the death rate data.\n\ns_06959: Parallel work on the contribution of households focus on how household-level shocks affect educational attainment (two examples are Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; de Janvry and others 2005).\n\ns_07009: The estimated parameters show that regular savings are a significant and important predictor of a household's probability of moving out of slums.\n\ns_07059: pairs 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Mill.\n\ns_07109: We used Conley's spatial GMM technique to allow for instrumental variable estimation in the presence of spatially autocorrelated errors.\n\ns_07159: Panel A provides this information segregated by the number of companies held by the fund and those covered by Worldscope.\n\ns_07209: If the reliability ratio of expenditures were similar in Ecuador, this would imply proportional attenuation bias of 0.18 to 0.30. standard error of 0.19); children in conditioned households are also more likely to be enrolled at baseline (the difference in the probability of enrollment is 0.075, with a standard error of 0.019), and are younger (the difference is -0.43 years, with a standard error of 0.11).\n\ns_07259: This implies that there is information to be extracted from the level of GATS commitments: deeper commitments can be used as a signaling device.\n\ns_07309: On the other hand, and consistent with our expectations, all four specifications imply a large (around 10 percent) and (in three of the four) statistically significant, positive association between bidding and the productivity growth rates (second row under (a)).\n\ns_07359: 18 There have been a number of studies and proposals on aid for trade over the past year, including proposals for new mechanisms to channel new assistance.\n\ns_07409: In our view, the best empirical work in our sample which takes this problem into account is Lopez et al.\n\ns_07459: The main conclusion from this section is that grants and ODA debt relief to African countries most likely have been allocated according to some intricate economic hierarchy-but one that is difficult to identify on an a priori basis]7 In fact, the relative allocation of grants and ODA debt relief among the countries in the sample consistently violates basic economic hierarchies such as level of absolute poverty, access to other sources of finance, and indebtedness.\n\ns_07509: persons that contributed at least once This was 1,078,914 members as of March 1982 and 1,099,778 as of March 1988 (including the deceased in both numbers).\n\ns_07559: This paper attempts to bring together these three elements of the external sector ---trad&, aid and investment -and assess their effects on growth and sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa."
