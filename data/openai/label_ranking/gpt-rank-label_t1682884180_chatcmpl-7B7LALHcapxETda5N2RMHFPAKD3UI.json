The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00611: Notably, ACE2 expression was found to be low, and TMPRSS2 was moderately expressed throughout the menstrual cycle.\n\ns_00653: In this paper we have separated the effects of river freshwater input and light attenuation on ocean stratification and temperatures in the Amazon and Orinoco plume area.\n\ns_00703: 0.08 ppm) for a season, sums of maximum rection between samples.\n\ns_00753: Though notably smaller than the entire ECLS-K:2011 sample (n=18,174), this weighted analytic sample size reflects non-response on science assessments in kindergarten or first grade as well as missing demographic data.\n\ns_00803: The crisis in the South African school system is well-documented (Bloch, 2009; Fleisch, 2008; Letseka, Bantwini & King-McKenzie, 2012 ).\n\ns_00853: In eastern Colorado, nests in remote locations had greater productivity than nests in more accessible locations (Olendorff, 1973) .\n\ns_00903: Several studies have specifically focused on the hippocampus for early diagnosis of AD and build predictive models upon anatomical features including volume and shape based measures, and image intensity texture features Devanand et al., 2012; Ben Ahmed et al., 2015; de Vos et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Aderghal et al., 2017; Tsao et al., 2017) .\n\ns_00953: We have therefore limited the analysis to the overlapping period 1993-2014.\n\ns_01003: The increase in heated volume can be determined using: The average temperature in the heated upper stratum can be calculated using the following relation: By assuming a linear temperature profile in the upper stratum the temperature at the liquid surface can be calculated from T b (bulk temperature) and T av (the average temperature in the upper stratum).\n\ns_01053: Table 1 and table 2 provide descriptive statistics for farm and nonfarm households.\n\ns_01103: Our first focal analysis, also reported in Table 3 , examined the interaction between age composition and classroom quality.\n\ns_01153: The average improvement of SHIPS due to the inclusion of the TCHP and GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) data reaches up to 3 % for the 96 h forecast (Fig.\n\ns_01203: Mixed model analyses were performed using version 3.1-118 of the NLME package for R [25] .\n\ns_01253: Drawing on recent literature from UNESCO (2011), the SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011), Lankshear and Knobel (2008) , Greene et al.\n\ns_01303: Studies that assessed heterogeneity of clinical presentations either specified criteria a priori or used statistical methods to identify subtypes.\n\ns_01353: 42, 59 In this context, multivariate analysis approaches such as machine learning, which can take into account simultaneously different clinically meaningful measures, have the potential of generating valid, clinically relevant, and usable prediction models.\n\ns_01403: This is done using scatter diagrams between the two normalized time series (Wilks, 1995) .\n\ns_01453: Second, some important covariates are unavailable in the NIH data.\n\ns_01503: Based on the Student t-test and assuming yearly independence, correlation coeffi cients >0.32 are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\n\ns_01553: To compare the spatial distribution of the bed changes in the entire estuary, the measured morphological changes over the three years are shown in Figure 4 (a) , in which the red color indicates deposition of sand, and the blue means erosion of bed.\n\ns_01603: Therefore, the inferences about the number of introductions and the corresponding geographical source need to be interpreted with caution.\n\ns_01653: In order to be able to handle the large volumes of imaging data emanating from large therapeutic trials, it would seem appropriate to strive for further, if not complete, automation.\n\ns_01703: An analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated demographic, race, and sex-based disparities that have not yet been reported in the literature.\n\ns_01753: In Setting 3, the probability of a missing sample depends on missing covariates and the response variable, which leads to informative missingness and biased imputation based on the complete group in SI-SCAD.\n\ns_01803: Future studies should use other data sources to investigate the relationship among immigration, segregation, and health."
