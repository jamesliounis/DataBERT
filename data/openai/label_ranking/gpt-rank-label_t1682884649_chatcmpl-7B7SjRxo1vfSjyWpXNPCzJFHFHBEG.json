The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08872: Beck's theories of the risk society and individualization (Beck, 1992a; Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002 ) have been particularly influential in this strand of the literature.\n\ns_08922: Level 3) The curve fits the data better than the appropriate null hypothesis by some objective measure.\n\ns_08972: On the basis of a start date of 5 June, years of thermal breakup accumulated between 700 and 760 MJ/m 2 , while years of mechanical breakup and 2002 experienced breakup after 560 to 590 MJ/m 2 , with the exception of 2010 in which 700 MJ/m 2 were accumulated ( Table 1).\n\ns_09022: This is an additional area for future research.\n\ns_09072: Results indicate that SATCON performs well against the TC's best track dataset.\n\ns_09122: The focus of this work is to assess the combined predictive capability of this model for early detection of conversion of MCI to AD by using only the information available at baseline.\n\ns_09172: NPSAS:12 staff also created a study member definition by identifying key data elements across data sources that were necessary to support the analytic objectives of the study.\n\ns_09222: The problem has been solved in more recent versions of the ARMS survey, but the early estimates are still being used to support critics' arguments.\n\ns_09272: Thus, total daily activity counts were log transformed ( Figure 2C and  D) , which resulted in a distribution much closer to normal ( Figure 2D ) and a reduction in heteroscedasticity around the regression line ( Figure 2C ).\n\ns_09322: The next few parameters are the ones that measure correlations between two brain regions.\n\ns_09372: Tables 3-7 report classification results from SVMs independently trained with volumetric features from MorphoBox and FreeSurfer and whole-brain voxel-wise GM concentrations from SPM.\n\ns_09422: Longitudinal research may shed some light on temporal relationships between BMI, BMD, and AC, whereas experimental studies may gain insight into the causal mechanisms by which a reduction in body size may increase AC, for instance through mobilization of bone calcium.\n\ns_09472: The variants were called by using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.3.8.0 with the HaplotypeCaller algorithm [26] and were manually inspected in GenomeBrowse v2.1.2 (GoldenHelix).\n\ns_09522: In addition to above, CDC has approved a one-step rRT-PCR test kit to quantitatively determine viral molecules in [ 90 samples within 45 min [106] .\n\ns_09572: In either case, we obtained an estimate of the overall effect size (denoted by d) for each age category and personality factor, which was also tested for statistical significance by computing a 95% confidence interval.\n\ns_09622: Importantly, the results presented in table 4 and in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap is not driven by differences in course taking or academic ability, but rather by within-group differences in effort.\n\ns_09672: Directly using raw cortical thickness measures as features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for clinical group classification only yields modest results since brain areas are not equally atrophied during AD progression.\n\ns_09722: We analyzed (see figure at left) the proportion of students who earned the three types of baccalaureates degrees, according to eighthgrade expectations and math achievement scores.\n\ns_09772: Because in the case of a small amount of data, if the training set error is small, it may appear overfitting.\n\ns_09822: The qualitative approach was used for in-depth investigation to describe various mathematical problemsolving strategies demonstrated by participants across the three different research phases.\n\ns_09872: Given the promising initial results found in our companion paper for Cystic Fibrosis patients [5] , we investigate the application of the Disease-Atlas -a novel conception of the joint modeling framework using deep learning -to jointly predicting the expected time-to-transition to Alzheimer's disease and the values of longitudinal measurements, providing additional clinical decision support to doctors evaluating potential Alzheimer's disease patients.\n\ns_09922: The second explanation applies the Rybczynski Theorem to predict a sectoral reallocation of resources towards industries intensive in the use of the newly abundant 42 60 percent of these scientific and academic workers are classed as engineers or architects (Central Bureau of Statistics 2001).\n\ns_09972: Data are utilized for both high school and elementary principals.\n\ns_00024: 2011; Scherer and Dawson 2011) .\n\ns_00074: In their logistic regression analysis of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, which included 1988 survey data from students in eighth grade who indicated their future career preferences at age 30 and data for those who obtained baccalaureate degrees from 4-year institutions by the year 2000, Tai et al."
