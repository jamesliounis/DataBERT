The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02270: In summary, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that markers of AD and vascular pathology operate simultaneously to affect metabolism in different brain regions.\n\ns_02320: The water quality topic is being evaluated with further study (see Section 4.5).\n\ns_02370: 5 Written informed consent was obtained from all ADNI participants at their respective ADNI sites.\n\ns_02420: 603 Codiga, D. L., & Aurin, D. A.\n\ns_02470: Fourth, our exclusion criteria for LVC services were based on medical history recorded in claims before, but during the same year as the service date, due to data availability.\n\ns_02520: To identify loci subject to positive selection in a non-recombining system, we built a tool combining evolutionary simulations, CNNs, and RNNs to perform sliding window analysis across a genome.\n\ns_02570: The empirical method we propose explicitly accounts for both the count nature of visits to private information providers and observed heterogeneity in consultations with experts sought by farmers.\n\ns_02620: The NATPOL PLUS surveyed 2329 people over 18 years of age who had been diagnosed MetS on the basis of NCEP-ATP III criteria.\n\ns_02670: Moreover, cortisol concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been found to be higher in subjects with dementia and MCI due to AD compared to control subjects (Popp et al., 2009 (Popp et al., , 2015 .\n\ns_02720: Our SAT sample records students' self-reports of their family income in 13 categories, so we compute re-weighting factors from the census data for each of these categories to represent the projected family income distribution.\n\ns_02770: Most notably, we detected a general loss of coniferous forest cover types in the basin, and a trend towards a mixed forest type.\n\ns_02820: There was no statistical evidence of additive interaction between GA and household SES (P = 0.47; Figure 2A ).\n\ns_02870: In addition, ECLS-B weights W2C1-W2C90 adjusted for nonparticipation, so the results are applicable to the original sample.\n\ns_02920: Future researchers should keep any respondent downloads to an absolute minimum whenever possible.\n\ns_02970: The use of effect size allows one to compare mean differegzes among group even when the tests are on different scales.\n\ns_03020: Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore how primary school teachers perceive the practice of implementing monitoring support on the basis of autonomous monitoring groups by educational level, and what factors have a decisive influence on their positive or negative perception of the above approach to assessing educator/student effectiveness.\n\ns_03070: For each center, the intra-class correlation coefficient (absolute model) of hippocampal tracings was computed to assess the intra-and inter-reliability.\n\ns_03120: Selecting rice as a case study to analyze multifunctionality in U.S. agriculture is useful for two reasons.\n\ns_03170: Second, by employing preference \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, we control for any unobserved characteristics speci\u2026c to individuals who hold a given preference.\n\ns_03220: Thus a problem with wheat supply triggered a sequence of events-also involving other major exporters-that led to the crisis in rice prices and market access discussed in colorful detail by Slayton (2009) .\n\ns_03270: Table 6 presents specification tests for the optimal models.\n\ns_03320: The estimation window used was of 180 calendar days before June 30, The figure shows the difference in cumulative abnormal returns (CADR) between a bank with high and low wholesale dependence (75th and 25th percentile of the global distribution of wholesale dependence) and its 90 percent confidence bands for different measures of abnormal returns and wholesale dependence.\n\ns_03370: Table 3 reports estimates for the two-stage Heckman selection model defined by expressions (1) and (2).\n\ns_03420: Taking first the extent to which export earnings (aggregate value of exports of final products, components and parts) of a network pay for imports of parts and components, only four CEEC were in red in 1998.\n\ns_03470: \"5 It is important to note that even in the single-product case and with a U-shaped average cost, the optimal solution will not always involve equal outputs by all \u2026rms.Baumol and Fischer (1978), andBaumol et al."
