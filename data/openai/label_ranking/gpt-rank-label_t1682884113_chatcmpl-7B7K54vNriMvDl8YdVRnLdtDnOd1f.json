The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08184: At the same time, Page 3 these individuals place a high value on college even without the subsidy, which suggests that although they value the subsidy, they still would enroll in college without it.\n\ns_08234: The MAA's Progress through Calculus study [1] has discovered that among Ph.D.-granting mathematics departments, 40% describe the use of active learning in the calculus classroom as \"very important,\" and 35% are experimenting with at least some sections taught with active learning approaches.\n\ns_08261: Primarily, data serves to inform on doctoral level professional outcomes.\n\ns_08311: Their dataset is particularly useful in providing information on both the scale and the dates of the measures implemented.\n\ns_08361: Analysis was carried out using logistic regression controlling for sex, age,four ancestry principal components and study.\n\ns_08411: After segmenting each 3-D image, we obtain a partition into regions (clusters) and we need to find some consensual information for each population (AD, CN or MCI).\n\ns_08461: For example, some of the studies enhanced the likelihood for AD by choosing participants who were at higher risk or who already had MCI, outcomes were onset of AD or MCI, they had relatively short follow up periods of 4 to 7 years, and they did not incorporate the comprehensive biomarker or imaging assessments that are available today.\n\ns_08511: This dataset was built around an initial educational distribution of the population by age and sex, with high quality criteria.\n\ns_08561: The imaging and proteomic biomarker data was analyzed using the implementation of elastic net logistic regression provided in the Matlab package glmnet.\n\ns_08611: In a multivariate regression examining the amount of buprenorphine dispensed (in grams per capita per year), we found that 100patient-waivered physicians had a greater positive impact than did 30patient-waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, or substance abuse treatment facilities.\n\ns_08661: To provide a context for interpreting the achievement results, detailed information on students' backgrounds and attitudes towards mathematics and science, teachers' background, classroom characteristics and school contexts for learning and instruction, was gathered from the students taking part in the study.\n\ns_08711: The comprehensive set of skill assessment statistics are calculated to provide relevant information on model behaviour and global assessment of errors.\n\ns_08761: Race/ethnicity was not found to be significantly associated with past participation and past opportunity to participate in health research; however, a significant association between race/ethnicity and willingness to participate in health research was seen (\u03c7 2 R-S (6) = 22.53, P = 0.001).\n\ns_08811: This experiment aims to assess the coherence of the proposed visualization approach with the a priori knowledge of the disease.\n\ns_08861: Although there is ample evidence to suggest that young people have borne the brunt of the crisis (Green, 2017) , other research has found that the actuality of these circumstances has had unexpected effects on young people's views of the future.\n\ns_08911: found in distribution of human incomes or the sizes of cities) and come from CLT-like arguments (Montroll and Shlesinger 1982) .\n\ns_08961: Here, breakup is defined as the date the ice concentration decreases to 10% [Kniskern and Potocsky, 1965], which is similar to our record of the breakout of pressure ridges (Table 1).\n\ns_09011: Instead, we drew on publicly available results of a U.S. Department of Agriculture-sponsored study to assess school exposure to food desert census tracts within a 500-m Euclidean buffer around the schools [58] .\n\ns_09061: Proper utilization of satellite data with positive impacts on forecast skills still requires more investigations and validations.\n\ns_09111: The FDG-PET data was processed to get 3D-SSP as detailed in Section 2.\n\ns_09161: 2012/17 BEGINNING POSTSECONDARY STUDENTS LONGITUDINAL STUDY (BPS:12/17) DATA FILE DOCUMENTATION deduced with certainty based upon logical or mathematical relationships among observed variables, the weighted sequential hot deck method was used to replace missing data by imputing plausible values from statistically selected donor cases (Cox 1980;Iannacchione 1982).\n\ns_09211: It is worth emphasizing again that estimates of farmlevel impact summarized in Tables 1 through 3 are for a relatively small number of locations and years.\n\ns_09261: Stage one modeled the relationship between age and log cumulative activity counts and revealed a significant negative association (\u03b2 = \u22120.021, p < .001) ( Table 2 , Model 1), with an estimated 2% relative loss of activity counts for each increased year of age.\n\ns_09311: Below we describe some of its functionality.\n\ns_09361: These cases, which are specified by their unique ADNI identifier in Appendix C, relate specifically to 2/229 controls, 2/401 MCI patients, 1/188 AD patient in the 1.5 T dataset, and 1/47 control, 4/71 MCI patients, 2/33 AD patient in the 3 T dataset."
