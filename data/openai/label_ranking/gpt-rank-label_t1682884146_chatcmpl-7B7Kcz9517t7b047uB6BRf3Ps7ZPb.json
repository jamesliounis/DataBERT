The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01902: PANDORA, performed on a Sequenom MassAR-RAY instrument, includes 52 single nucleotide genetic variants selected to represent the top hits from published genomewide association studies (GWAS) and the interests of the researchers in the different cores.\n\ns_01952: At present, the data collection is nearing completion and a separate paper will be published in due course outlining the methodology and research findings regarding this.\n\ns_02002: Miksza (2007) , using data from National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 with a sample of 5335, created a composite item which assessed student participation in music for the entire duration of the study from eighth to 12 th grade and measured academic achievement in mathematics, reading comprehension, science and social studies.\n\ns_02052: Table 1 compares the advantages and disadvantages of different detection methods for SARS-COV-2.\n\ns_02102: Studies with data from US hospitals and SEER reviews show that in general, Hispanics have more distal type cancer than non-Hispanic whites [14, 15, 18] .\n\ns_02152: The search string applied on the publications database of Dimensions resulted in 9146 papers, containing 7332 articles and 1814 pre-prints.\n\ns_02202: Objectives: Studies on survival of people with clinical diagnosis of dementia can provide estimates of care outcomes of a health system and offer real-life insights on how to provide better support for the target population.\n\ns_02235: By contrast, greater CSF-A\u03b2 (per 10-pg/mL increase) in these same patients ( Table 4 ) was associated with increased temporoparietal metabolism (model 1 coefficient, 0.005; P = .03).\n\ns_02285: Of particular interest for our study were a pair of H-sheets from 1877 and 1878 of Jamaica Bay: Maynard [1877] and Moore [1878].\n\ns_02335: FDG-PET acquisition and preprocessing details have been described elsewhere (29) .\n\ns_02385: 697 Whitney, M. M., & Codiga, D. L. (2011).\n\ns_02435: Our final sample contained 6,873 PCPs with 1,078,840 attributed patients.\n\ns_02485: To ensure accurate inferences, we applied a conservative filtering step removing any samples with excessive genome masking relative to the overall sample distribution (Supplementary Figure 4 ; see Online Methods).\n\ns_02535: Koenker and Hallock (2001) showed that asymptotically valid inferences on the parameters of the quantile can be made given that the conditional probability density function f (Yjx) is continuous.\n\ns_02585: A similar relationship was noticed by Hammarsten et al.\n\ns_02635: In other studies, OSA has been associated with increased nocturnal plasma cortisol levels (Chopra et al., 2017) .\n\ns_02685: Page 3 Our results represent a baseline expectation in the event that current trends continue, and are obviously sensitive to policy shifts that change relative outcomes of African American and white students.\n\ns_02735: Hopefully future data products will include compatible satellite derived circa 2000 land cover maps for the southern Ontario portion of the basin, and new updated 2006 land cover map for the entire Canadian portion of the Great Lakes Basin to match existing maps covering the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes.\n\ns_02785: Using data from a population-based cohort for studying outcomes of preterm birth, however, comes with the caveat that it may underrepresent children who are more ill and unable or unwilling to participate in such a study.\n\ns_02835: The TAS-45 was used by several large-scale studies.\n\ns_02885: The remainder of this paper will discuss the MPW EB's survey methodology, results, and recommendations.\n\ns_02935: In dr NELS:88 data, for instance, it is clear that the highest achieving students in mathematics study algebra with the greatest intensity.\n\ns_02985: The literature review allowed us to identify scientific sources that cover the categorical framework for education monitoring (Hoover, 2009; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016) , the principles of monitoring in the primary school education process (Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016) , and the impact-factors to its effectiveness (Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Fulton, 2018) .\n\ns_03035: The main software adopted during the site qualification phase were ImageJ, MIPAV, MRIcro, MNI tools, and the Gradient Non-linearity Unwarping Tool.\n\ns_03085: PROC LOGISTIC procedure of the statistical package SAS was used to obtain parameter estimates."
