The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03706: The length reached 74,100 km by 2010 (National Statistical Bureau 2011).\n\ns_03756: To put this in the same terms as we used for Brazil we would have to calculate the distribution of, for example, HIV/AIDS patients by income decile.\n\ns_03806: 21 Gas prices turn out to be statistically non-significant when included in the regressions together with Brent prices, which is not really surprising given that about 0.\n\ns_03856: We will return to investigate the correlates of this heterogeneity below.\n\ns_03906: 1.148 million (Table 6 .1).\n\ns_03956: In the literature the taxable capacity and the tax effort of countries have been estimated using regression analysis, focusing on possible determinants of taxes.\n\ns_04006: These data provide more precise information on times of infection and death than MDICP does.\n\ns_04056: Ideally, the control groups would have been matched to ensure comparability, but even comparisons with Brazil over the period in question would have been more illuminating than simple trends.\n\ns_04106: Please contact Priscilla Infante, room MC9-904, telephone 202-473-7642, fax 202-522-7105, email address pinfante@worldbank.org.\n\ns_04156: The regressions also provide evidence that the distributions of both users and non-users shifted between 2003 and 2010.\n\ns_04206: Let E* denote the threshold value of the productivity shock below which partial default (at the margin) occurs on the initial level of debt, that is\n\ns_04256: And R can be sufficiently large, if A is sufficiently large.\n\ns_04306: Mory (1993) and Lee et al.\n\ns_04356: The intra-class correlation within a district for KCPE varies between 15%-25% (across sectors and before and after FPE) and we would therefore argue that the collapsed scores contain some relevant information.\n\ns_04406: Although this approach offers a better understanding of the determinants of trade flows, it provides biased estimates in the presence of heteroskedasticity in trade data (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2009) .\n\ns_04456: Where X are additional control variables that may be likely to determine the desire of the migrant to remit for education.\n\ns_04506: As we shall see later, this hypothesis is supported by the within country analysis, which finds stronger support for those two theories among firms with a higher share of temporary workers and among those that display a larger worker turnover rate.\n\ns_04556: The resulting subgroups are known in the literature as \"types.\"\n\ns_04606: As a natural \u2026rst step -and following speci\u2026cation (1) -we compute the cumulative \u2026scal multiplier for OECD countries, which is illustrated in Figure 1 This linear (or single) multiplier provides us with a benchmark to \u2026rst revisit the AG exercise of computing multipliers in expansions and recessions and later examining whether it matters if government spending is going up or down.\n\ns_04656: A similar study undertaken in Brazil analyzed the prevalence of child malnutrition in relation with income and basic services redistribution policies (Monteiro et al.\n\ns_04706: Data come from the CEPII Trade and Production Database.\n\ns_04756: A number of studies indeed explored first-generation effects of the HSAA.\n\ns_04806: These may be viewed as robustness checks to the results presented in the previous sections.\n\ns_04856: The coefficient is consistently negative and significant at the 1% level throughout columns 2 through 6 in table 3.\n\ns_04906: \"United Republic of Tanzania: Sixth Review Under the Policy Support Instrument, Second Review Under the Standby Credit Facility Arrangement, and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria.\""
