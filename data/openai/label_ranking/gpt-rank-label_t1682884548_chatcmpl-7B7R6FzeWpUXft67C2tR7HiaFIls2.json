The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08970: melt seasons 2009 and 2010 (presented in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Regional Sea Ice Outlook; www.arcus.org/search/seaiceoutlook).\n\ns_09020: Drawing on this literature, we explore the extent to which school-to-neighborhood SES and racial similarity is a predictor of an Oregon public high school holding an open campus policy, which would permit students to leave campus and interact with the proximate SES and racial conditions.\n\ns_09070: Thus, a high spatial resolution is required in making accurate TC simulations and predictions.\n\ns_09120: Besides APOE carrier status, the above analysis was also done after adding log transformed CSF-biomarkers: A\u03b2-42 and ptau 181 concentration, which reduced the study sample-size to only: 29 NL, 36 AD and 59 MCI.\n\ns_09170: Staff matched and downloaded student financial aid data from CPS, which houses and processes data contained in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms.\n\ns_09220: Fulton and Keyowski (1999), in a theoretical modeling exercise, pointed to the importance of farmer heterogeneity in modeling the distribution of benefits when the transgenic and traditional markets are segregated.\n\ns_09270: Finally, stage three included covariates for demographics, functional status (gait speed), and history of comorbidities including: race, years of education, current employment status, cognitive status, history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and anemia.\n\ns_09320: We used 19 sets of NL subjects' and 12 sets of AD patients' longitudinal brain MRI images as input to compute the displacement field and Jacobian determinant between the baseline and the follow-up images by Christensen's method.\n\ns_09370: For consistency with Cuingnet et al.\n\ns_09420: Comparisons between the AC severity groups were drawn by one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests, as appropriate.\n\ns_09470: Two of those sequences (Turkey/HGSM/5516/2020 and Turkey/HGSM/8010/2020) were located in the same cluster and share cluster-specific variants (G1397A, T28688C, G29742T).\n\ns_09520: In a major study involving investigation of 3617 available whole genome sequence of SARS-COV-2 maintained in NCBI globally identified that E protein possess several non-synonymous mutations [23] .\n\ns_09570: Fifth, after developing a preliminary list of studies, we reviewed the references cited in each article for additional studies.\n\ns_09620: Table 5 reports estimates of extensions of equation (1) that interact the male indicator with the academic achievement variables and estimate the model separately by SES categories.\n\ns_09670: Max-pooling is an aggregate statistics dimensional reduction technique.\n\ns_09720: We applied multinomial logistic regression, which handles categorical dependent variables with more than two outcomes.\n\ns_09770: Suk 15 et al performed a 2sample t test on each voxel, selected voxels with a P value smaller than the predefined threshold, and extracted patches as ROIs with a fixed size by taking each of these voxels as a center.\n\ns_09820: Findings from the first phase showed a limited number of problem-solving strategies being used by the participants, which emphasizes the need for this study.\n\ns_09870: For the i th patient at time t, observations are made for a K-dimensional vector of longitudinal variables is defined to be the first time the event is observed after t, which allows us to model both repeated events and events that lead to censoring (e.g.\n\ns_09920: We start with crude estimates of broad Irish and Jewish ancestral diaspora and then try to narrow our focus to measurements of overseas nationals that are more directly relevant to the development of high-tech industries in the three countries.\n\ns_09970: Data are utilized for both high and elementary teachers.\n\ns_00022: Once provided, NDAR staff curate new data structures ensuring that new instruments, measures, and scientific experiments are properly defined and that common elements like gender, age, height and weight are reused.\n\ns_00072: Once the final model was developed, we tested its stability by comparing model fitted across six subsamples disaggregated year by year.\n\ns_00122: For example, Hawkins et al.\n\ns_00172: Since the registration results across subjects exhibit high variance, as shown by the standard deviations, we show the Dice score for each subject in Figure 3 ."
