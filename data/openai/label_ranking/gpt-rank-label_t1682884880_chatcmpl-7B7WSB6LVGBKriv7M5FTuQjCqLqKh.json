The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01169: The coloring in the track indicates the intensity of the TC according to Saffir-Simplson scale Since 2004, an operational satellite-altimetry-based TCHP analysis product, referred to as Oceanic Heat Content, was implemented at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) (Mainelli et al.\n\ns_01219: Of this, 14.1 points were due to differences present at baseline, leaving 7.1 points due to differences in slope over the trial period.\n\ns_01269: Given such lags, a key concern is to measure the extent of digital adoption and appropriate usage of digital tools.\n\ns_01319: Of the 17 studies, 10 studies assessed depression, three studies assessed social phobia, and there was one study each on PTSD, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and panic attack.\n\ns_01369: These subgroups could potentially then be used to further inform supervised learning, for instance, by stratifying the subjects before making predictions.\n\ns_01419: Teleconnection of the Arctic Oscillation to the East Asian monsoon has been demonstrated by several studies (Gong et al., 2001; Ho, 2002, 2003; Wu and Wang, 2002) .\n\ns_01469: The second area where we found gender differences was in the fraction of firstyear applicants who submit another proposal in the following two years.\n\ns_01519: Th e interactive GOSSYM, as coupled with the CWRF model, can be used in future studies to provide more credible and detailed depictions of cottonclimate interactions.\n\ns_01569: Even though comparisons are made in this large estuarine area including the river reaches, the predication accuracy is still in a reasonable range which is acceptable for the engineering practical applications.\n\ns_01619: cases that end-up disconnected due to intermediate asymptomatic\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. .\n\ns_01669: In order to allow investigators to select an analysis method, based on an unbiased assessment of various alternatives, one possible approach is to create annotated longitudinal MR image datasets from carefully selected and representative MS patients from multiple scanners/ centers.\n\ns_01719: Significant univariate variables were included as covariates along with age, sex, and year.\n\ns_01769: For example, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data involve multisite longitudinal observational data from elderly individuals with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's Disease (AD) [36, 35] .\n\ns_01819: Pearson's Correlation Coefficients between Mortality and Segregation Indices (Table A) .\n\ns_01869: Statistical significance was determined by calculating t values for differences between pairs of means or proportions and comparing these with published values of t for two-tailed hypothesis testing, using a 5 percent probability of a Type I error (a significance level of .05).26 Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: Er -E2\n\ns_01919: Briefly, the INDD is a relational database implemented with Microsoft SQL Server (version 2008; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).\n\ns_01969: were covered in the initial baseline survey and followup surveys.\n\ns_02019: In a later study Miszka (2010) using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, taking account of a wider range of variables studied the impact of musical engagement on standardized mathematics scores and found that students in high-school music ensembles were more likely to have higher standardised mathematics achievement scores.\n\ns_02069: 12 Figure 1 depicts a series of important events and scientific discoveries since the advent of SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_02119: Our study highlights the burden of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and also underscores the critical need for cancer registry capacity building A number of hurdles exist to advance PBCRs in low resource settings.\n\ns_02169: Ten most popular research papers among the 9146 COVID-19 papers were extracted on the basis of their Altmertrics score on April 12, 2020.\n\ns_02219: BDNF polymorphism may help in early identification of those more likely to resist accrual of WMH and loss of hippocampal microstructural integrity, with effects varying by sex.\n\ns_02252: Table 3 gives estimates of the associations of WMHs with FDG-PET in different brain regions in converters and nonconverters.\n\ns_02302: These estimates were then combined with a fourth from NOAA [NOAA-NCDC, 2011] to produce a final damage estimate and uncertainty range for the whole of the USA.\n\ns_02352: Our ADNI subsample was typical in showing progressive hypometabolism from CN to MCI to AD (31) (32) (33) ."
