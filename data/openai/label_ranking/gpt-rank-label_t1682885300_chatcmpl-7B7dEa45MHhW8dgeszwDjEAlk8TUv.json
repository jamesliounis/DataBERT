The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00288: First, the neuropsychological MCI categories described above were tested in a logistic univariate model.\n\ns_00338: 23, 29, 30, 33 Furthermore, in the last few years, LC-MS/ MS is becoming more and more available in the clinical setting and this evolving scenario is expected to be implemented, especially in clinical laboratories able to provide high throughput outcomes thanks to the procedural low costs that allows saving money for each assay and writing off expenses due to initial purchase of technological equipments.\n\ns_00388: First, the environmental benefits that will result from WSIN technologies during Stage 10 will depend on the rate or speed of adoption (the slope of the S curve), and on the extent or ceiling of adoption (where the S curve levels out).\n\ns_00438: Using ADNI [ 18 F]-florbetapir data, Chen et al.\n\ns_00488: The mean values for item guessing, slipping parameters and the discrimination index are presented in the last row of Table 4 .\n\ns_00538: Although the choice of the number of variables to report is arbitrary, we expect the top ten will provide an adequate basis for comparing models.\n\ns_00588: The BRAIN Initiative, with its focus on technology development and the normal brain, is essential in elucidating how the brain processes information and initiates behavior, and it should continue to be supported.\n\ns_00638: Expression of viral proteins showed significant changes at different stages of the cycle except for TMPRSS2 which remained relatively constant.\n\ns_00680: Similarly, Howden and Murtugudde [2001] saw a slight surface cooling (20.1 C) in the Bay of Bengal caused by rivers and White and Toumi [2014] report that the Congo plume has no effect on SSTs.\n\ns_00730: There are, however, certain limitations with exThis study econometrically estimates the impact trapolating from field trial experiments to eco-of air pollution on corn and soybean yields, connomic models.\n\ns_00780: Results from the NAEP, a nationally representative study, demonstrate that racial/ethnic and gender achievement gaps in science exist in fourth and eighth grade (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012).\n\ns_00830: This approach provided flexibility in addressing the emergent needs of the participants.\n\ns_00880: Sensitivity to human disturbance may be heightened in years of low prey abundance (White and Thurow, 1985) .\n\ns_00930: For the -th binary problem ( > ), its positively labeled training dataset + and negatively labeled training dataset \u2212 could be constructed as\nBased on the training dataset, a binary classifier could be trained using any pattern classification techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) and random forests (RF) (Tin Kam, 1998) .\n\ns_00980: In the previous version of the CCMP product (version 1.1, light blue) the trend is even stronger, as the estimate at later times is close to the estimate of the new product, while they 10 differ at the beginning of the time period.\n\ns_01030: The average temperature of the heated volume will be somewhere between T b and T s , depending on the temperature profile in the heated volume.\n\ns_01080: The life-cycle hypothesis is also tested using regression analysis.\n\ns_01130: Thus, future work should incorporate more specific behavioral measures thought to be influenced by peers, such as empathy and leadership, and should rely on stronger measures that can better capture change in these behaviors.\n\ns_01180: However, the UOTS could not be monitored with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to address the issue until the introduction of satellite altimeters in the 1990s (Fu et al.\n\ns_01230: Given the lack of success in trials of potential diseasemodifying and symptomatic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD), experts have recommended enriching trials with groups that are more likely to respond [1] .\n\ns_01280: The framework below, presents the commonalities expressed by the authors who described the sub-components to digital literacy.\n\ns_01330: While only a limited amount of work has been conducted in this field, we found growing epidemiologic evidence that, not only can mood and anxiety disorders be differentiated by symptom syndromes and trajectories, but that the factors associated with these disorders may vary between these subtypes.\n\ns_01380: Overall, PSYSCAN and similar large cohort studies are purposely designed to significantly contribute to the bench-to-bed approach and aim to develop clinically usable tools to predict psychotic illness onset and course, differential diagnosis, treatment response, and functional outcome, with practical implications for individualized treatment.\n\ns_01430: Most of the scatter diagrams reveal a robust or at least moderate linear relationship (not shown).\n\ns_01480: However, female applicants for NIH grants in 2001-3 received on average only 63 percent of the money that male applicants received."
