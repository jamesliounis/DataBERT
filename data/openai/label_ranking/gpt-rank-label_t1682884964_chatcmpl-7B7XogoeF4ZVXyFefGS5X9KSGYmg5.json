The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03654: It has been shown that such action would imply average tariffs on merchandise imports from India and China of over 20 percent and would depress their manufacturing exports between 16 and 21 percent (Mattoo, Ng, and Subramanian, 2009) .\n\ns_03704: This holds particularly true for firms in sectors that are not electricity-intensive and that face significant power outages(Alby, Dethier, and Straub 2011).20 Infrastructure in the context of this paper refers to various types of hard infrastructure, such as highways, telecommunications networks, port facilities, and power supplies.\n\ns_03754: With this information it was possible to calculate the number of SE cases reaching courts; the likelihood that plaintiffs succeed; and, on the basis of interviews of judges, advocates, and others involved in the cases, as well as a review of the secondary literature, the level of implementation.\n\ns_03804: However, tests for unit roots (see Table 3 ) appear inconclusive given the very low statistical power of such tests26 so that we treat the time series as stationary, albeit highly persistent.\n\ns_03854: See Table 6 for other notes.\n\ns_03904: Since excluding them from the estimation of health impacts would be a serious omission, annual average PM10 levels were assigned to these cities based on scaling up of the World Bank modeling PM10 concentrations (taken from the World Bank Internal Research Database), using an average factor for the major cities.\n\ns_03954: While the estimated coefficient of income was around 2.2 in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it is only 1.11 in the traditional tax specification; and it gets even lower and insignificant (0.503 and 0.002 with bureaucracy index and corruption index, respectively) when the institutional variables are included in the specifications.\n\ns_04004: As seen in On average, women of that group assign probabilities of 0.59 and 0.69 to being infected when 21 There were signicant improvements in model t beyond three types.\n\ns_04054: For reasons indicated above in connection with the World Bank 42-country study, one would like to take group sizes and their changes into account.\n\ns_04104: employment with the same employer, and on the treatment of pre-and post-retirement inflation (Bodie and Merton 1992) .\n\ns_04154: The results typically reinforce the findings from the Cox regressions (Table 2, right panels).\n\ns_04204: which implies in turn that dfih/dC < o.12 So far we have not made any specific assumption about the distribution function of the idiosyncratic productivity shock, Eh.\n\ns_04254: 9 That is the central message of this paper.\n\ns_04304: While this study focuses on renewable energies, nuclear energy is also argued to be an important carbon-free source of energy with various benefits such as being non-location specific and scalable (see Kessides, 2010 , for an evaluation).\n\ns_04354: Having estimated the sector-district-time fixed effects \u03b4 m j,t in the first step, the second-step (5) consists of a linear regression of the predicted value of enrolling in a school sector on its various determinants.\n\ns_04404: The RESET test (Ramsey 1969 ) performed on our data suggests the presence of heteroskedasticity in our sample.\n\ns_04454: The first was to test the responsiveness of total migrant remittances when migrants have the ability to control some of this for education use.\n\ns_04504: In a similar vein, Campbell and Kamlani (1997) also report that turnover-related explanations are important for white-collar workers.\n\ns_04554: (2009) and Friedman (1962) argue the former.\n\ns_04604: For example, cell (1,1) indicates that industrial countries spend, on average, 29 percent of the time in good times with government spending going down.\n\ns_04654: (2008) employs multivariate logistics regression to examine inequities in the use of maternal healthcare services and finds that significant inequalities due to asset ownership, area of residence, and parental education.\n\ns_04704: In a second stage, to assess the implications for our results of the compromises that we have made with the greenfield FDI data, we collapse the M&A data in 13 broad sectors and assume that the source sector is the same as the destination sector.\n\ns_04754: Although we lack detailed health outcomes in our data, insufficient preventive care is likely to lead to greater incidence of otherwise preventable diseases, including the need to spend resources on dealing with these.\n\ns_04804: In particular, we consider the normalized sum of the period by period squared deviations of the predictions of the model from the actual Thai data for the five time series 29 displayed in Table 2 in the Appendix.\n\ns_04854: In summary, our individual level controls establish findings that several other studies have found."
