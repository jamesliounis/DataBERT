The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09931: Of particular interest to the present study, Barrett and O'Connell also separately examine the premium for different industries.\n\ns_09981: The variables are as follows: c4 = exceeds/or equals standards; c2 = years of experience; c3 = % low -income; and c5 = salaries.\n\ns_00033: DICOM, MINC 1.0 and 2.0, Analyze, NIfTI-1, AFNI and SPM).\n\ns_00083: The area between the estimated probability curve for both HSSLRA and CLRA (blue line) and only CLRA (green line) offers some indication of the \"added value\" of the HSSLRA experience for respondents who continue to pursue LRA experiences in college.\n\ns_00133: This finding echoes Toledo-Dreves, Zabin, and Emerson (1995), who found that nonresident teenage fathers were frequently involved in child care.\n\ns_00183: However, most registration algorithms are designed for high-resolution researchquality scans.\n\ns_00233: It must be noticed that, for both countries, the gap in CPDR between males tends to enlarge after standardization, but in terms of fatality ratio, it tends to decrease slightly.\n\ns_00280: The memory clinics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and Akershus University Hospital in Oslo employ the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, similar clinical assessments and similar neuropsychological test batteries.\n\ns_00330: Of them, the main are: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), the European Male Aging Study (EMAS), the Rancho Bernardo Study (RBS), the InCHIANTI Study, the Troms\u00f8 Study, the Concord Health and Aging in Men Project (CHAMP), the Health in Men Study (HIMS).\n\ns_00380: The most fully developed of these applications involve using wireless sensor networks to monitor and validate the effectiveness of green roofs in achieving various environmental goals, and to better inform green roof design, especially with regard to plant selection for storm water remediation (Starry, 2013) .\n\ns_00430: SUV values were calculated for the four candidate reference regions (CER, BS, CW, and TW) and the mean cortical (MC) regions using the same time window as the SUVR analysis.\n\ns_00480: It is desirable for a DINA model to have small guessing and slipping parameter estimates for a good model-data fit (Rupp et al., 2010) .\n\ns_00530: Land cover variables, wetland and upland, collectively occurred as 67% of the top ten variables in the SDMs but comprised only 42% of the available predictor variables (Table 4) ; wetland and upland variables were 1.5 and 1.8 times more likely to appear in lists of top ten predictors than in the list of available predictors, respectively.\n\ns_00580: The collaborative focus of so many participants and funding organizations on developing new technologies and using them to elucidate brain circuitry is unprecedented.\n\ns_00630: Additionally, the suggestion that ACE2 expression increases with age is not quantified clinically.\n\ns_00672: It is derived by applying a first order fit on the relationship of modeled wake cooling to WPi and CI [Vincent et al., 2012b]: (2) with c 0 ,c 1 ,c 2 , and c 3 being the fit parameters.\n\ns_00722: A number of studies of atable considering that higher temperatures would mospheric pollution have used the kriging method correspond with more sunlight and thus elevated to convert point-source data to geographic areas levels of ozone formation.\n\ns_00772: We extend the literature by focusing on science achievement gaps in the first two years of schooling and by utilizing more current data.\n\ns_00822: Instead, the solution can be found in the relationship among the various elements within the school district (Senge, 2006: 67) .\n\ns_00872: Keeley and others (2016) examined the difference in Ferruginous Hawk diet between rural and exurban (that is, semi-rural land use characterized by low housing density of more than 2 ha per housing unit) grasslands in New Mexico.\n\ns_00922: Conversion to AD within 2 or 3 years are generally used for the identification of pMCI in the literature.\n\ns_00972: The effects of the enhanced enthalpy and momentum fluxes on the upper ocean is investigated using sea surface temperature and sea surface height observational data products in the period 1993-2014.\n\ns_01022: Therefore one would expect the ullage temperature to be higher.\n\ns_01072: Several studies considered the life-cycle hypothesis.\n\ns_01122: In this study, we examined these complex relations and documented how the influence of the age of classroom peers varied based on children's own age along with classroom quality and teachers' education and experience."
