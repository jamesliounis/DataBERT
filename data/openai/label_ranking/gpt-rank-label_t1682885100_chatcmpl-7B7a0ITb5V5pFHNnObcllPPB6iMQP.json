The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08784: Therefore, it is imperative to understand factors related to diverse populations' research participation, willingness to participate, and opportunities to participate as a first step to developing strategies to facilitate their participation in health research.\n\ns_08834: With the prob CNN metric using the validation set, the dissimilarity between folds and 5 runs of the same fold are equivalent with respectively 0.78 and 0.82.\n\ns_08884: Hashim (a 22-year-old from a British Pakistani ethnic background) worked with us as young researcher and conducted several interviews with peers who were longterm unemployed, NEET and/or involved in crime.\n\ns_08934: Hence, I will refer to these distributions collectively as POLO (power lognormal) throughout the remainder of this paper.\n\ns_08984: The best performance would have been obtained for a starting day of year 158; that is, 7 June (cumulative irradiance threshold MJ m \u00c02 ).\n\ns_09034: The large standard deviation (SD = 23.19) around the mean reflects wide variability in walkability across school settings.\n\ns_09084: Section 2 discusses TC detections from satellite observations, while Sections 3 and 4 describe analysis of TC structure and intensity with satellite remote sensing.\n\ns_09134: Despite evidence for the predictive capability of individual biomarkers, cognitive measures, or neuroimaging data, relatively little attention has been given to combining information available from multiple imaging modalities with the biomarkers [4] .\n\ns_09184: They were also calibrated to weighted estimates obtained from NPSAS:12 and population estimates obtained from the IPEDS:2010-11 Fall Enrollment file (EF2011A) and the IPEDS:2011-12 Student Financial Aid and Net Price file (SFA1112).\n\ns_09234: In the two studies available the stacked gene cotton (including both Bt and RR technologies) compared favorably with conventional cotton, with an average 292 pounds per acre yield increase and a $243 per acre profit increase.\n\ns_09284: Two essential steps in this process are (i) obtaining accurate and reliable measures of physical activity using minimally invasive measurement tools and (ii) applying appropriate analytic techniques to optimize both the quality of the data and the extraction of information.\n\ns_09334: We combine these parameters with three local atrophy rate parameters into a sevendimensional vector, and use various vector classification methods to see if the methods can distinguish AD patients from normal (NL) subjects in 31 longitudinal MRI baseline images and their follow-ups from the ADNI database.\n\ns_09384: For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\n\ns_09434: Race was combined into two categories (African Americans vs. non African Americans), according to previous literature showing lower prevalence of AC in the African Americans race group 18 .\n\ns_09484: The cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and shared the common unique nucleotide substitutions, G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T, which were also found in our strain and partially in several Iranian cases [30] .\n\ns_09534: Further, whole genome sequencing analyses have revealed that mutations occurring in the spike protein are Ind J Clin Biochem important in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_09584: Second, we reviewed additional databases developed by Brent W. Roberts on personality development (Roberts, Robins, et al., 2003) .\n\ns_09634: The current study connects the literatures on homework, non-cognitive skills, and academic success by furthering our understanding of the magnitude and determinants of gender and SES gaps in secondary students' time use outside of the traditional school day.\n\ns_09684: Update the dictionary D by performing on step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [11] .\n\ns_09734: We categorized the responses into two groups: science-related and nonscience career expectations, creating the Career Expectation independent variable (4).\n\ns_09784: As a comparison, the classification accuracy of the combination of PCA and SVM and AAL and SVM was 79.5% and 63.1%, respectively.\n\ns_09834: This approach examined data before, during, and after the implementation of problem-solving mathematics lessons.\n\ns_09884: We start with an RNN at the base of the network, which incorporates historical information into forecasts by updating its memory state over time.\n\ns_09934: On the issue of the multinationals more generally, it would be interesting to go beyond anecdotal evidence about the role of the Irish, Indian and Israeli diasporas in tilting foreign direct investment in their country's favor to some harder evidence.\n\ns_09984: There is the frequent justification that higher average salary may be driven by the fact that in one district, for example, teachers have master's degrees and several have double -masters."
