The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02404: 679 Spydell, M.

(2015).\n\ns_02454: 6,12 We used these measures to identify LVC services that are relevant to primary care, relevant to patients 65 years and older, and measurable using Medicare claims data.\n\ns_02504: The combined CNN and FWuH model was used for classification of positive selection in empirical data.\n\ns_02554: To the extent that marketing information and information access have an effect on retention, attention must be paid to availability and delivery.\n\ns_02604: Based on the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) large cohort study, Parsons [31] developed a model in which the volume of the prostate is greater by 0.41 ml with a BMI increase of 1 kg/m 2 .\n\ns_02654: FIGURE 1 | Dose-response relationship between the memory performance and the cortisol levels.\n\ns_02704: Estimates of the correlation of income or wealth across generations at the family level are within the same range (Chadwick and Solon, 2002; Solon, 2002) .\n\ns_02754: In summary, we recommend a bi-nationally consistent classification of land cover collected at regular intervals (i.e.\n\ns_02804: Third, we assessed the robustness of our results to our choice of SES measurement variables (25) by defining SES using maternal education (less than high school, completed high school, some college, bachelor's degree or higher), household income at wave 1 (<$25,000, $25,000-$75,000, >$75,000), household poverty at wave 1 (<130% of federal poverty level, 130%-185% of federal poverty level, >185% of federal poverty level), and using the SES composite index as a continuous variable.\n\ns_02854: Path analysis is a subset of SEM (Ullman and Bentler 2003) , and is used to examine relationships between two or more variables.\n\ns_02904: Such statistics led us to believe that the MPWEB sample would be more likely than others to not only have access to, but use the Internet.\n\ns_02954: Group differences were apparent in levels of participation in science experiments (table 2.3).\n\ns_03004: Additionally, we discovered that every type is based on the further outlined stages (as suggested by Hoover (2009)) being exploratory (identification and selection of what and how to monitor and assess, and designing a monitoring schedule), implementation (activities aimed at checking parameters, assessing the performance and progress) and reflexion (making changes and improvements).\n\ns_03054: Moreover, I-ADNI cohort showed a lower proportion of medium quality MPRAGE scans in comparison to NA-ADNI (10% and 28%, respectively), while the percentage of low quality MPRAGEscanswerethesamebetweencohorts (Fig.2) .\n\ns_03104: Yield is a potential example.\n\ns_03154: Table 7 presents the results of the ordinary least squares estimation of (1) and (2).\n\ns_03204: where E t denotes the expectation conditional on information available in year t, and 1 t h \uf02b \uf025 and 1 t\n\ns_03254: [Insert Table 3 about here] Consistent with Hakura [15] , the results improve when we estimate the model for different sub-samples.\n\ns_03304: (2009) , this paper looks at a broad set of banks across a large number of developed and developing countries, and for the most part focuses on differences in returns across individual banks to identify a specific transmission mechanism rather than focusing on common factors and their determinants.\n\ns_03354: Column 4 presents estimates of the baseline specification that incorporates the modified infrastructure index, which has a coefficient almost twice as large as the coefficient of the original infrastructure index in the baseline estimates (Table 3) .\n\ns_03404: We shall use this index to assess the existence of links within narrowly defined production networks (see Section 5).\n\ns_03454: Separate regressions were estimated for the census years 1982, 1987, and 1992.\n\ns_03504: This result is congenial to that in De Gregorio andGuidotti (1995), who found that in high income countries FD was positively correlated with output growth during 1960-1985 but that the correlation was negative in the 1970-85 subperiod.\n\ns_03554: In fact, the census data suggest that manufacturing suffered its largest decline in 1997 already.\n\ns_03604: For each period t, we run a cross-sectional regression to estimate the coefficients, , and ."
