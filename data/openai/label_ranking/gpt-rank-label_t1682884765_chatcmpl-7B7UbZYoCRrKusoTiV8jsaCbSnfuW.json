The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01216: The primary test of interest was the significance of the group by time interaction, which would indicate that the slopes differed by MMSE category.\n\ns_01266: Each discipline is further influenced in terms of three perspectives, viz., Cognitive, Technical and Ethical in the manner the learner should use a particular tool (see Table 3 ).\n\ns_01316: Fourth, we retrieved articles not identified by our literature review from the references of remaining papers and excluded those that did not satisfy selection criteria.\n\ns_01366: Therefore, alongside clinical and cognitive data, blood samples (including whole blood, serum, and plasma) are collected for analyses of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and immune markers at baseline, 6 and 12 months in the CHR-P and HC cohorts and at baseline and 12 months in the FEP cohort.\n\ns_01416: We denote complex data field by T (x, y, t).\n\ns_01466: If we eliminate the very large awards and also control for other characteristics-age, academic degree, institution, grant type, institute, and year-the difference narrows again.\n\ns_01516: Th ey used the original GOSSYM, however, as a \"black box\" model (i.e., without the modifi cations outlined above) and did not provide a direct model validation as driven by realistic surface and climatic conditions.\n\ns_01566: The highest water stages in the monitoring stations in Case 7, i.e., Beiliao, Nanliao, Jiugang, and Touchien upstream, are lower than these in Case 4.\n\ns_01616: This observation is also in agreement with our estimates using travel data as detailed below ( Figure 3C and Figure S2 ).\n\ns_01666: The MICCAI MS lesion challenge has been mentioned above, and the sustained availability of those data allows further development of MS lesion segmentation methods.\n\ns_01716: Patient fields with missing data were recoded as empty cells to avoid inaccurate regressions on ordinal variables.\n\ns_01766: Let\nand H A N (\u03b2) be sub-matrices of H(\u03b2) consisting of rows corresponding to covariates indexed by A S and A N , respectively, where\ndenotes the first derivative of G(\u03b2) with respect to \u03b2 j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p. We also let we write w.p.a.1 as shorthand for \"with probability approaching one.\"\n\ns_01816: The spatial structure underlying the data contributes to this overestimation as the spatial filtering models generated weaker relationships between segregation measures and mortality, and improved the adjusted R-squared.\n\ns_01866: With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report.\n\ns_01916: Recently, our group proposed a model for comprehensive AD centers that would not be limited only to the study of AD but would also include the study of PD, FTLD, ALS, and vascular dementia [30] , because of their frequent overlap [14, 31] , using a multidisciplinary, patientoriented clinical and basic research strategy.\n\ns_01966: The primary aim of this paper is to report the study protocol and the resultant sociodemographic characteristics of the participants of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing baseline survey.\n\ns_02016: The standardized beta coefficients were .47 for KS2 mathematics and .27 for length of time playing an instrument (see Table 3 for details).\n\ns_02066: 18 Noteworthily, the comparative analysis of genomic sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV revealed that there were three homologous genomic regions in their ORF1ab genes that could promote recombination.\n\ns_02116: A significant burden of gastric adenocarcinoma is observed in Central America based upon the available registry data and in spite of the probable underreporting for the LMICs in the areas.\n\ns_02166: Citation based analysis is a prominent method to capture academically significant and theoretically relevant material (see for example Glanzel, 2003) .\n\ns_02216: The val66met genetic polymorphism of BDNF is recently emerging as an early marker of brain structural integrity.\n\ns_02249: These regressions were repeated to examine the association of CSF-A\u03b2 with the same FDG-PET measures.\n\ns_02299: These were used to create 1609, 1877 and present-day model grids for sECOM (see Section 2.1), including land elevation and Mannings-n roughness (Figure 8).\n\ns_02349: For each of the five ROIs and two control regions, separate mixed models were used to test effects of baseline diagnosis (CN, MCI, AD) or MCI conversion (MCI-S, MCI-P).\n\ns_02399: Yet recent studies"
