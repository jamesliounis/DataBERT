The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01168: 2010) in which its intensity increased from 21 to 72 m s -1 (40-140 kt) in just 42 h and from 39 to 72 m s -1 (75-140 kt) in the last 24 h prior to peak intensity.\n\ns_01218: Differences between groups at the conclusion of the trial reflected both differences in the baseline scores on the ADAS-Cog and differences in the rate of decline over the duration of the trial, with the former having a greater contribution than the latter.\n\ns_01268: Thus, a regular survey informed by a representative sampling exercise of the national population, could be conducted to produce nationally representative results taking into account the low levels of internet and mobile access together with the high costs of internet access in emerging economies (McKinseyandCompany, 2014), Joncas and Foy (2012) discuss the process followed in measuring international literacy via the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) data collection instruments, and in essence highlight that rigorous sampling exercises are needed across countries, to ensure their target population is estimated correctly.\n\ns_01318: According to Thase (2007) , for example, the origins of the atypical depressive subtype can be traced back to the work of Sir Aubrey Lewis, who in the 1930s proposed dividing depression into endogenous or nonendogenous subtypes, a partition supported by the psychopharmacologic work of West and Dally in 1959 [5] .\n\ns_01368: These algorithms will initially be validated by dividing the samples into discovery and validation subsamples, and more definitively by testing the algorithms on analogous, independent datasets from other research consortia, through the\n\ns_01418: Section 3 discusses the temporal and spatial characteristics of the interannual variability and its propagation using CEOF analysis.\n\ns_01468: In an amendment to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Authorization Act of 2002, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) requested that the NSF conduct a study to \"assess gender differences in the distribution of external Federal research and development funding.\"\n\ns_01518: (1989) derived the phenological coeffi cients for maize (Zea mays L.) through inverse modeling by closely matching the CERES-maize Th e use of this optimization in the current study required a large ensemble of GOSSYM standalone simulations.\n\ns_01568: Moreover, some researchers proposed several semi-empirical numerical approaches to assess long-term morphological changes on both the meso-and macro-scales in coastal inlets and tidal lagoons in estuaries, e.g., tide-averaging approach and Rapid Assessment of Morphology (RAM) (e.g.\n\ns_01618: Our study suggests multiple independent introductions from across the world, mainly from Europe and the co-circulation of multiple lineages in the most affected departments.\n\ns_01668: Although the method by Gerig et al.\n\ns_01718: Advanced age (HR, 1.05;
