The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08553: We have done an integrative analysis of structural MRI data and proteomic data to examine their predictive power and identify relevant biomarkers in a large MCI/AD cohort.\n\ns_08603: Our findings must be considered in the context of our study's limitations.\n\ns_08653: TIMSS-2003, re-named Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, followed the lines of TIMSS-1999.\n\ns_08703: A summary of relevant terms and quantities is shown in Table 2.\n\ns_08753: Statistical analysis SAS v. 9.4 19 (Cary, NC) was used to conduct statistical analyses.\n\ns_08803: The rest of the ADNI dataset was used as training/validation set.\n\ns_08853: We illustrate these themes using the narratives and cases of specific individuals who distilled the wider patterns apparent in the data.\n\ns_08903: 1983 , Williams 1995 , Lomolino 2000 , 2002 , Lomolino and Weiser 2001 , Williamson et al.\n\ns_08953: On the basis of historical data, we inferred that both modes likely occurred between the 1930s and 1950s, and that breakup between 1973 and 1976 was likely thermal every year.\n\ns_09003: The low access measures derived from the 2010 Decennial Census, the 2010-2014 American Community Survey, locational data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and TDLinex, and the Nielson directories of supermarkets and large grocery stores that serve as \"proxies for the complete set of stores that sell a wide variety of healthy foods at affordable prices\" [58] (p. 2).\n\ns_09053: For example, a recent study indicates that introduction of the ATMS data into the HWRF system has significant impacts on forecasts of hurricane intensity and track [103] .\n\ns_09103: The major contribution of this article is the ability to extract, in order of relevance, the disease-characterizing patterns from multiple imaging modalities.\n\ns_09153: The core data elements used in the 2012/17 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:12/17) full-scale student survey covered general topics that were organized into six key content areas: enrollment, education experiences, financial aid, employment, income and expenses, and background.\n\ns_09203: A sample of studies estimating the aggregate impacts is also included.\n\ns_09253: Participant characteristics by age group are detailed in Table 1 .\n\ns_09303: Then we performed an analysis using vector classification methods on the same dataset we used for the analysis of [3] , to examine whether differences between AD and NL subjects could be identified with some combinations of the features.\n\ns_09353: The analysis dataset was constituted by taking the standardized ADNI 1.5 T dataset and replacing every 1.5 T scan by the corresponding subject 3 T scan when available, resulting in a set of images with mixed field strengths (about 80% 1.5 T and 20% 3 T) from all distinct subjects with the same size and diagnosis repartition as the 1.5 T dataset.\n\ns_09403: This research project used data from the BLSA, an ongoing prospective study of normative aging in community-dwelling volunteers living primarily in the Baltimore-Washington area (USA) 9 .\n\ns_09453: Lastly, we have compared the whole genome of hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 with a dataset of 3970 available SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries retrieved from GISAID.\n\ns_09503: In a study by Guan et al., patients with DM showed higher disease severity (16.2%) in contrast, patients without DM showed lesser disease severity (5.7%) [25] .\n\ns_09553: First, we reviewed the reference list from an earlier meta-analysis of rank-order consistency for longitudinal studies (Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000) .\n\ns_09603: Specifically, we use two complementary, nationally representative datasets to test the hypotheses that female and high-SES secondary students spend more time on homework, on average, than their male and less-advantaged counterparts.\n\ns_09653: In this work, Stochastic Coordinate Coding (SCC) [11] was adopted to construct the dictionary because of its computation efficiency.\n\ns_09703: These variables included scores from mathematics and science achievement tests (designed by the Educational Testing Service) that were administered in the first three surveys of data collection, when students were mostly enrolled in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades (3, 4) .\n\ns_09753: The results of the comparison experiment are shown in Figure 8 and Table 3 ."
