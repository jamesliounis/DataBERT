The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08823: Preprocessing of T1w MR images was performed with the Clinica software platform (www.clinica.run) [9] .\n\ns_08873: Around half of the sample (50) were contacted as part of their continued participation in the CELS (see Keating et al., 2010) .\n\ns_08923: In addition, most macroecologists are familiar with the fact that by simple properties of the logarithm, the CLT predicts that when many variables interact multiplicatively, we should find a lognormal distribution (McAlister 1879 , MacArthur 1960 , May 1975 .\n\ns_08973: As a result, this appears to be one of the first studies of the interannual variability of the breakup process of landfast sea ice.\n\ns_09023: At the time of this study, we did not have access to the geographic locations of establishments typically used in previous food desert research as markers of healthy or unhealthy off-campus food options [52] .\n\ns_09073: The application and customization of Dvorak analysis worldwide described in [23] help demonstrate its versatility and robustness as a tool for TC forecasting.\n\ns_09123: The supervised PLS dimensionality reduction is applied on combined imaging data of AD and NL subjects.\n\ns_09173: The 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12) Data File Documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014) describes the development of the NPSAS:12 weights.\n\ns_09223: A few studies have attempted to estimate the aggregate economic impact of a particular transgenic field crop (or group of crops) and the distribution of the impact on the various sectors involved.\n\ns_09273: Current employment (\u03b2 = 0.150, p < .001) and faster gait speed (\u03b2 = 0.619, p < .001) were independently associated with greater activity, and history of stroke was associated with less activity (\u03b2 = \u22120.230, p = .005).\n\ns_09323: The methods we used here provide some new features to the ones we developed in ref.\n\ns_09373: The GM tissue probability maps in native space were obtained from SPM8 New Segment (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) and subsequently normalized to the population template generated from all images in the standardized ADNI dataset using the iterative DARTEL approach (Ashburner, 2007) , a procedure that took about three days on a standard PC.\n\ns_09423: Univariate correlation coefficients between predictors, mediator and outcome of the predefined mediation pathway are shown in Figure 1 .\n\ns_09473: All cell lines used in this study purchased from ATCC cell culture company.\n\ns_09523: According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), total 9,004,365 confirmed cases were reported, whereas 132,162 deaths occurred till November 20, 2020 [4, 5] .\n\ns_09573: Unfortunately, there are very few data to date on this topic as it has only recently become a focus of longitudinal researchers (Mroczek & Spiro, 2003; Roberts, 1997; Small et al., 2003) .\n\ns_09623: adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.\n\ns_09673: Specifically, we use 7 epochs to learn the dictionary in this work.\n\ns_09723: However, for physical science/engineering degrees, the result was quite different (see figure on page 1143, right panel).\n\ns_09773: In this study, a new framework for the early diagnosis of AD using DBN to extract the features of FDG-PET data is proposed.\n\ns_09823: The qualitative approach was used for in-depth investigation to describe various mathematical problem-solving strategies demonstrated by participants across the three different research phases.\n\ns_09873: The samples obtained can then be used to compute expectations and uncertainty intervals for forecasts.\n\ns_09923: In this section we briefly and selectively piece together what the economics literature has to say about the economic effects of emigration.\n\ns_09973: Results from the 2009 National Assessment of Education Progress, commonly called the Nation's Report Card, showed Chicago's eight graders scored 27 points lower (out of 300 total) than their peers nationwide in their understanding of several core areas of science; physical, life, earth and space.\n\ns_00025: Sharing data, associated tools, and methodologies, rather than just summaries or interpretations, can accelerate research progress by allowing re-analysis of data, as well as re-aggregation, integration, and rigorous comparison with other data, tools, and methods."
