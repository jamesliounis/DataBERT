The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04949: Kao (1997) shows that in this case parameters estimates are consistent even if the estimated relationship is not a cointegrating one.\n\ns_04999: These results are consistent with previous work and contribute to the literature on the impact of exchange rates on export growth by showing in a cross section that the nature of trade, i.e.\n\ns_05049: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\n\ns_05099: We estimate the D-index based on the logit model discussed in the regression analyses section.\n\ns_05149: The interested reader should read the paper as the discussion here highlights only some of the important factors that can lead to productivity growth and is in no way provides a comprehensive listing of such factors.\n\ns_05199: The dependent variables are the inverse hyperbolic sine of expenditures at various providers over the past year.Note that the regressions of EMP and public facility expenditures as dependent in Panel B could not be estimated due to insufficient variation.\n\ns_05249: Most of the information available comes from detailed case studies or cross-country studies in which governance is summarized into a number of limited indicators.\n\ns_05299: the above multi-component formula), special matching grants program can be a useful tool for motivating local resource mobilization.\n\ns_05349: In fact, our results are consistent with the findings in Reinhart (2001) .\n\ns_05399: In the following, the average and the median are used as summary statistics.\n\ns_05449: Second, some of the instruments that have been considered in recent literature such as Alfaro and Chen (2018) explore supply-side variations across multinational firms and require detailed firm-level operation and investment data that are usually unavailable across a wide range of countries.\n\ns_05499: The World Bank's Doing Business project (World Bank 2018a) and the vast empirical literature using its data provide numerous examples of how bureaucratic complexity can affect a firm's ability to operate and grow.\n\ns_05549: Second, since the second goal of this paper is to make comparisons across countries and across time, it is not feasible to harmonize the occupational classifications for all the household surveys (which are around 600 in this study).\n\ns_05599: When considering shaking in isolation (rows), as one could expect, greater numbers of WWTPs (and dependent populations) are exposed to higher shaking classes with greater return period events.\n\ns_05649: , 1989; Fernihough y McGovern, 2015) .\n\ns_05699: In practice, the spending units that generate these large transactions are few 1 and capturing transactions from these units would result in the same high coverage.\n\ns_05749: Several important implications arise from these findings.\n\ns_05799: Recent examples include Ben Yishay et al.\n\ns_05849: Many studies have found that exposure to particulates is strongly associated with mortality and morbidity (Wells 1994; World Bank 1996; Cropper et al.\n\ns_05899: Parameter estimates are reported in Table 1 and Table 2 for equations (1) and 2respectively.\n\ns_05949: The transactions that fit in these criteria can be observed at most once in a month and enables empirical analysis using a large panel data set.\n\ns_05999: Meanwhile, the sign and level of significance of other variables in model (1) remain largely similar (see tables 5 and 3).\n\ns_06049: These \u2026ndings are broadly consistent with those of other studies focusing on the developed world (e.g., Lusardi et al., 2011) .\n\ns_06099: The remaining columns estimate continuous time proportional hazard models, assuming an exponential baseline hazard in columns (3) and (4) and using the semi-parametric Cox model in columns (5) and (6).\n\ns_06149: In Panel A, labor force participation rate, employment in agriculture, industry and services are from the International Labor Organization, Key indicators of the Labor Market Database."
