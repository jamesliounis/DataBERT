The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07507: In the Chilean -case, these have been much higher than expected, as shown in the next table, suggesting that the quality of service was very high.\n\ns_07557: In principle, it is necessary to distinguish between the short term and medium-tolong term aspect of the question.\n\ns_07607: To clajify this issue requires investigating Rawski describes the statistical materials and the extent of possible upward bias.\n\ns_07657: In order for the deal described in Section XIII to materialize, the country will have to be able to finance it in the following amounts: The sum of the upfront costs is (5.85+5.97+3.6+1.74+2.9) US$20.06 million.\n\ns_07707: which has a constant price elasticity of supply of ca, and I present sensitivity analysis for various values of (x.\n\ns_07757: The demand for money and quasi-money equations discussed in the previous section were used in the model set out in section a) in order to consider the impact of inflation and government demonetization policies on seignorage revenue for the period from 1977-1988.\n\ns_07807: Recent work by Racine (1989) has examined the optimal window width, h, in the sense of integrated mean square error.\n\ns_07857: Copies should also be available for review by the local population.\n\ns_07907: Deferral is preferred if Ad -And > 0, implying ul(#+Z) -uoZ[l-a]t*-t > 0.\n\ns_07957: It is not a limitation of this study per se in the sense that there is no reasonable alternative to the sampling approaches used given the time and budgetary constraints.\n\ns_08007: 3 See Demigurc /Kane (2001).\n\ns_08057: 21 We estimate a multinomial logit model to investigate what factors determine household choice of a heating fuel.\n\ns_08107: Indeed, in a majority of countries public consumption rose relative to GDP, while public infrastructure investment fell, implying that the public investment cuts partly financed an expansion of public consumption.\n\ns_08157: This is reflected in the fact that some 75 percent of families were grouped in the second class (just above the indigent; see Malanima 2006 , Table 3 , p. 9).\n\ns_08207: dents thus may determine prior to enrolling that they have a small chance of graduating, which would lower the value of attending, and choose not to enroll in the first place.\n\ns_08284: The SDR longitudinally tracks demographic and employment information about individuals who earned a doctorate degree in a science, engineering, or health field.\n\ns_08334: 8 coded a structured dataset of non-pharmaceutical interventions divided in 8 themes and 63 categories in 56 countries, the Complexity Science Hub COVID-19 Control Strategies List (CCCSL).\n\ns_08384: Conversely, we test whether AD risk variants from a GWAS meta analysis of approximately 54,000 account for any variance in iron measures (n~9000).\n\ns_08434: The MI between the random variable x i and y is given by\nThe probability density functions for MI were estimated through the use of histograms.\n\ns_08484: These trials were designed in a manner that cost significantly less than current industry-funded treatment trials (Table 1) .\n\ns_08534: (2015) The results show not surprisingly the same sub-regions at the top as aforementioned, meaning with the highest level of MYS and the lowest level of intergenerational gap.\n\ns_08584: These analytes may play a role in disease pathology and warrant further investigation in independent samples.\n\ns_08634: 39 We are unaware, however, of studies examining the relative impact of waivered physicians vis-\u00e0-vis treatment facilities regarding the overall amount of buprenorphine being dispensed across treatment systems and payers, or to what extent the distribution of buprenorphine to patients may be influenced by the number of patients a physician is allowed to treat at one time with buprenorphine.\n\ns_08684: Use of Technology: Computers and calculators.\n\ns_08734: Therefore, it is necessary to concatenate certain of these files to construct several continuous time series for further analysis."
