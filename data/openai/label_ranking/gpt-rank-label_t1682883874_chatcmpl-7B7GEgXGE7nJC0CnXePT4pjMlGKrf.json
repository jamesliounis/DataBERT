The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05831: Appropriately mobilized and interpreted, data from such sources could elevate the state of the art in pollution research, policy analysis and implementation.\n\ns_05881: Tables of regression results based on this alternative definition of participation in a GVC are available from the authors on request.\n\ns_05931: The ERPT findings are in line with the findings of Casas (2019) for these sectors and the higher tariff pass-through compared to exchange rate pass-through are in line with (Mallick & Marques, 2008) .\n\ns_05981: 2019; van Biljon and Kotz\u00e9 2007) .\n\ns_06031: Measurement and sources of data regarding parameters and were discussed in detail in Section 4.\n\ns_06081: These data provide important contextual information on the correlations between income, food security and employment status.\n\ns_06131: Based on the Development Economics Group data from the World Bank, Brodmann, Pouget, and Gatti (2010) show that, in 2005, Egypt was among the top 10 emigration countries in the world.\n\ns_06181: The DHS is the most recent nationally representative data set including a measure of welfare and therefore this survey was used as the base for the reweighting.\n\ns_06231: Notes: This chart is based on the data summarized in Table 1 , panel (C) .\n\ns_06281: In equation 2, the reference is the control villages, and T1, T2 and T3 correspond respectively to the treatment arms with transfers of 0, 70,000 and 140,000 GNF.\n\ns_06331: This empirical approach has been used in Alesina et al.\n\ns_06381: More details about the sample construction procedure, readers are referred to Ahsan, Emran,\n\ns_06431: Results (DID estimates) are presented in Figure 5 (details in Tables 8 and 9).\n\ns_06481: For details on these approaches, seeAhrens, Hansen and Schaffer (2020).\n\ns_06531: \u2022 Help desks Figure 14 displays the shares of TPOs that have adopted each of these virtual tools during COVID, as well as the shares that are planning to continue to use them post COVID.\n\ns_06581: The information thus assembled includes detailed revenue data on customs and excise taxes that describe the complex tax and trade protection system in India, an input-output table updated to 1987-88, and household expenditure information from the 38th round of the National Sample Survey (see Appendix B).\n\ns_06631: Similar factors were also at wor]k in Sweden.\n\ns_06681: The results are in Table 11 .\n\ns_06731: (Chowdhury and Cash 1996).\n\ns_06781: See the appendix for a description of the instruments used.\n\ns_06831: See, for example, a recent study of Nicaragua's agricultural sector (WorldBank, 2002d) in which an entire chapter was devoted to agricultural risks and risk management strategies.\n\ns_06881: 14 The same analyses of the DHS data summarized above provide estimates of the differentials in fertility rates.\n\ns_06931: The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_06981: We use a standard probit model to calculate the propensity score for each observation in the participant and the comparison-group.\n\ns_07031: And other questions alike\" (page 277)."
