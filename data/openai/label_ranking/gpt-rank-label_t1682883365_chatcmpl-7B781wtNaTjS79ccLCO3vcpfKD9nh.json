The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06076: For the purposes of this study, we used the monthly data set with zonal statistics up to ADM3-level aggregation, comprising governorate, district, and sub-district divisions.\n\ns_06126: In this paper, we rely on data from the ELMPS 2012.\n\ns_06176: Similar patterns exist when focusing on respondents' answers in terms of whether they have access to these information sources or what their main source of information is (see Figure A15 in Appendix A).\n\ns_06226: See Tables A.4 and A.5 for the full set of results.\n\ns_06276: 2015, Ganimian and Murnane, 2016; Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016 and Molina Mill\u00e1n et al., 2019) .\n\ns_06326: 3 On the other hand and more closely related to this paper, it contributes to the pool of studies using administrative data or census data.\n\ns_06376: The paper concludes with summary of the ndings and points out the central contributions of the paper to the literature.\n\ns_06426: Second, our paper contributes to the strand of literature on the (distributional) impact of energy subsidies on household and firm behavior (Komives et al., 2005; Davis, 2014; Younger et al., 2016; Basurto et al., 2020; Hahn and Metcalfe, 2021; Berkouwer et al., 2022) .\n\ns_06476: For similar results see also Belloni, Chernozhukov and Hansen (2014) and Sosa-Escudero, Anauati and Brau (2022).\n\ns_06526: Figure   15 provides the share of TPOs that answer that the corresponding virtual program had the largest number of applicants, or the largest expenditure share.\n\ns_06576: Some details at a more disaggregated level follow.\n\ns_06626: The UK FSA offers the most recent experience however and this in the context of a \"big bang\" involving some 1800 staff in London.\n\ns_06676: The results are presented in Table 8.\n\ns_06726: Consumption data from 1,072 households in one district of Bangladesh are used to show that the largest effect on poverty occurs when a moderate-poor BRAC client borrows more than 10,000 taka ($200) in cumulative loans (Zaman 1998) .\n\ns_06776: 3 So far most of the literature has focused on the United States mainly due to data constraints (see Gawande and Krishna, 2002) .\n\ns_06826: There is an overview article by Reardon, Berdegue, and Escobar (2001) , and country studies on Nicaragua (Corral and Reardon 2001) , El Salvador (Ruben and van den Berg 2001) , and Honduras (Lanjouw 2001) .\n\ns_06876: Recognizing the aforementioned data problems in studying the socioeconomic differences in social indicators, Bidani and Ravallion (1997) use an indirect method of inferring the conditional means from cross-country (or cross-regional) aggregates.\n\ns_06926: What are the implications of this finding?\n\ns_06976: Summary statistics for all variables are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 provides the estimation results.\n\ns_07026: The comparative GDP data clearly shows that the footwear industry was affected disproportionately in relation to the manufacturing sector as a whole\" (WTO 1999 para.\n\ns_07076: They divided their dataset in cohorts and used a large list of variables as determinants of growth, including microdata from PNAD -National Household Survey.\n\ns_07126: Panel A of Several conclusions can be drawn from this analysis.\n\ns_07176: The analysis is based on an experimental design.\n\ns_07226: Source : EBRD Transition Report, 2004.\n\ns_07276: We first tested whether PCs are correlated with productivity improvements when managers are selected through bidding, since we hypothesize that bidding will provide government with more information (row (a))."
