The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01530: A more important capability in modeling variability is the temporal correspondence between GOSSYM and observed anomalies from 1 yr to another.\n\ns_01580: However, in Cases 3, 4, and 6, in which the Jiugang channel is planned to be dredged, the storm flood water can trigger rapid deposition (more than 2 m) on the dredged channel bed.\n\ns_01630: These samples were barcoded with the Native Barcoding Kit EXPNBD104 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and pooled in an equimolar amount.\n\ns_01680: While the ''holy grail'' of a comprehensive segmentation method accessible by all researchers in the field should still be pursued, improvement of existing techniques may be a useful alternative approach.\n\ns_01730: [39] [40] [41] Category in parentheses defines the strata the hazard ratio represents.\n\ns_01780: More precisely, the proposed method reduces the RMSE of any Table 6 : The \"NS\" represents the mean number of selected variables.\n\ns_01830: Note that in the spatial filtering models, these eigenvectors were already included in the analysis and could be regarded as additional independent variables that represent the covariates omitted in regression but associated with mortality (e.g., migration trends).\n\ns_01880: For example, respondent S, was assigned a disturbance term to his/her F3QWT as in equation 1.6 above.\n\ns_01930: For the routine diagnostic procedure, the sections detailed in Table EA2 are stained with hematoxylin-eosin to quantify neuron loss and gliosis, and the following primary antibodies are used for the detection of abnormal proteins: nab228 (monoclonal antibody [mAb], 1:8000, generated in CNDR) [43] to detect amyloid deposits and for Thal staging [44] , phosphorylated tau PHF-1 (mAb, 1:1000, a gift from Dr. Peter Davies) to detect phosphorylated tau deposits, pS409/410 (mAb, 1:500, a gift from Dr. Manuela Neumann) to detect phosphorylated TDP-43 deposits [3] , and Syn303 (mAb, 1:16,000, generated in the CNDR) to detect the presence of pathological conformation of a-synuclein [45] .\n\ns_01980: 2020; Asmundson and Taylor 2020; Blakey and Abramowitz 2017; Jungmann and Witth\u00f6ft 2020) .\n\ns_02030: The mean for progress for those learning 2/3 years was 3.47 (SD = .69) and for those learning for 4/5 years 3.77 (SD = .65) and for performance at KS4 for the those learning 2/3 years 45.09 (SD = 6.37) and those 4/5 years 48.6 (SD = 5.34) (see Table 2 for details).\n\ns_02080: 122 It effectively inhibited the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human lung epithelial cell-derived Calu-3 cells, and its EC50 value was about 10 nM, 123 showing good potential for COVID-19 treatment.\n\ns_02130: As expected, nearly three fourths (14,539) of cases in our analysis were from Costa Rica, attributed to their long-standing national cancer registry.\n\ns_02180: Altmetrics or article level metrics according to Das and Mishra (2014) is a \"new trendsetter\" to measure \"impact of scientific publication and their social outreach to intended audience\".\n\ns_02263: We investigated the follow-up difference that was observed for nonconverters and converters with respect to the findings.\n\ns_02313: This downloadable Microsoft Excel file summarizes the results of the benefit-cost analysis of flooding under each Adaptation Scenario.\n\ns_02363: Regionally specific patterns of hypo-and hypermetabolism or hypo-and hyperactivation (with FDG-PET and functional MRI, respectively) have been seen in populations at risk for AD and have been implicated in the transition to clinical AD.\n\ns_02413: Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, C12012.\n\ns_02463: Previous studies had developed Medicare claimbased measures of LVC services.\n\ns_02513: For COG UK data, a, we only accepted samples with less than 1.8% of the genome masked, and b, did not find an excessive number of sites with masking in a genome-wide scan.\n\ns_02563: The procedure requires that m draws from the U(0, 1) distribution are taken and the average of the QR estimates of the m jittered samples (based on 1,000 draws) is calculated.\n\ns_02613: However, there are also a few reports refuting the existence of this relationship [47] [48] [49] .\n\ns_02663: In a cohort of elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, pre-operative geriatric depression scale scores were found to predict post-operative delirium.\n\ns_02713: Table 1 presents simulations based on the assumption that black application behavior remains as it is today.\n\ns_02763: This is changing as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in conjunction with the USGS NLCD effort, has begun work developing consistent bi-national land cover change maps for the Great Lakes as part of their Coastal Change Analysis Program (N.
