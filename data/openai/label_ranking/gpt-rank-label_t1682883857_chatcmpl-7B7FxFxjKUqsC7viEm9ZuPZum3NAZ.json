The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00848: In a Wyoming study, daily nest survival rate and fledgling production were greater for nests on anthropogenic structures (that is, artificial nest platforms, gas condensation tanks, abandoned windmill platforms, power poles) than on natural substrates (that is, trees, cliffs, rock outcrops) (Wallace and others, 2016) .\n\ns_00898: The comparison with the traditional multi-category classification methods based on the ADNI dataset has demonstrated that our method could achieve promising performance, indicating that the utilization of inherent ordinal severity of brain degeneration associated with AD's different stages could help achieve improved classification performance.\n\ns_00948: Due to the non stationary number of observational data, observations tend to weight more in the estimate towards the end of the time period, while in the first part the ERA-Interim background field dominates the average.\n\ns_00998: The tool is not intended for detailed simulation of every phenomenon, but rather it should be able to give an estimation of integral values.\n\ns_01048: Overall, the descriptive statistics and Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests support the life-cycle hypothesis for all farm and nonfarm households and by household type.\n\ns_01098: These dimensions of classroom quality are informed by existing theory (Pianta & Hamre, 2009 ) and empirically supported with validation studies and factor analyses of over 4,000 classrooms across the United States, yielding a similar three-factor structure solution (Hamre, Pianta, Mashburn, & Downer, 2007) .\n\ns_01148: 2000;Goni and Trinanes 2003;Goni et al.\n\ns_01198: The mixed effects model was used as it analyzes data from all participants (rather than just completers) and minimizes bias, and it has better controls for type I error in the presence of missing data [23] .\n\ns_01248: (2015) , the UNESCO (2011), Martin (2008) , Covello (2010) and Bawden (2008) .\n\ns_01298: However, these techniques can be overly sensitive to the data and may complicate comparisons across studies.\n\ns_01348: 4, 10, 44, [48] [49] [50] [51] This is important as the reliability of machine learning is directly affected by sample size, and overall accuracies are seen to decrease with sample size.\n\ns_01398: 6(a) ) is not clear in spatial amplitudes using the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset (Version 2, referred to as OI dataset), which has been used widely in oceanographic and atmospheric research (Fig.\n\ns_01448: If women are in fact less likely to apply for funding, female and male applicants for federal research grants likely differ in ways not observed in the data sets we employed for this study, especially at NIH, where the difference is sizable.\n\ns_01498: Both models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitude; however, the temporal correspondence between modeled and observed interannual anomalies was much more realistic in the redeveloped than the original GOSSYM because signifi cant (P = 0.05) correlations were identifi ed in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively.\n\ns_01548: For this project, before applying the CCHE2D-Coast model to evaluate the performance of the engineering plans, the reliability of the modeling results has been established through a comprehensive validation process in which historical morphological development scenarios are successfully simulated.\n\ns_01598: Library preparation and sequencing were performed following the ARTIC network (realtime molecular epidemiology for outbreak response) protocol and both Nanopore and Illumina technologies (21).\n\ns_01648: (3) A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS.\n\ns_01698: 10, 11 Although the literature includes a number of case series and reports about granular cell tumors as a whole, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] population-level data on malignant cutaneous lesions are limited.\n\ns_01748: Sources 1, 2, and 3 contain 4, 3, and 3 relevant covariates, respectively.\n\ns_01798: In this context, this paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining whether racial/ethnic segregation and specific dimensions of segregation are associated with US county-level mortality.\n\ns_01848: The results of this analysis are presented in the next section.\n\ns_01898: Samples from the frontotemporal degeneration and ALS centers are sent to the CNDR for processing after sampling, whereas the ADCC, the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Penn Udall Center for Parkinson's Research all process their own samples and send them already aliquoted and in sealed containers with dry ice.\n\ns_01948: However, efforts were made post-data collection to assess the degree of representativeness within and across the UK nations.\n\ns_01998: This revealed a multiple R of .64 with an adjusted R 2 of .41 (F[3,603] = 140.31, p < .0001).\n\ns_02048: CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, V-SARS, and inactivated vaccines from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute of Biological Products have been developed on the basis of this technology and are currently being assessed in clinical studies."
