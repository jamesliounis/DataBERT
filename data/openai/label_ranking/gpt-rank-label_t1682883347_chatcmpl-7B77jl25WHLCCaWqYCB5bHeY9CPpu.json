The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09852: Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Institute 1 , we show improvements in performance and scalability compared to traditional methods.\n\ns_09902: 23 In a provocative recent paper, Davis and Weinstein (2002) have examined the impact of balanced flows of factors to an economy (they focus on the US) with a superior CRS\n\ns_09952: For this study data were obtained for all school district in the state of Illinois.\n\ns_00004: Researchers can apply to NDAR to access this data and they can use this data set for comparison with similar data from subjects with ASD.\n\ns_00054: We used data from the PMQ for the years 2001-2006, which included respondent-reported participation in SLRA programs in high school and college.\n\ns_00104: Future qualitative research could address some of the empirical puzzles identified in this study's descriptive findings.\n\ns_00154: The second dataset contains isotropic 1mm T1-weighted brain scans from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset [27] .\n\ns_00204: is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\n\ns_00251: The findings are based on a selected group of patients recruited at two university memory clinics and diagnosed with subjective cognitive impairment or MCI based on GDS scores of 2 and 3 [3, 38, 39] .\n\ns_00301: While data on trajectories of sex steroids are almost available in all studies (see the paragraph above), information about the relationships among circulating sex steroids and/or various clinical aspects and physiological changes related to aging become patchy when moving across the various studies (Table 3) .\n\ns_00351: Majsztrik (2011) , which contained information base on site visits to operations in Maryland.\n\ns_00401: The estimated sample sizes for anti-amyloid therapy trials were smaller based on LC_Dyn data compared to the LC and the observed longitudinal MCSUVR change had smaller p values and larger effect size (Table 6 vs. Table 4 ).\n\ns_00451: Several recent studies (e.g., Dogan & Tatsuoka, 2008; Im & Park, 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Toker & Green, 2012; Lee et al., 2013) have been conducted to compare students' achievements on international large-scale assessments (e.g., TIMSS, PIRLS) using DCMs.\n\ns_00501: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096747.t002\nkm, 1-km, 2-km, 4-km, and 8-km.\n\ns_00551: Such agencies as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAR-PA) typically use this approach, and their efforts have resulted in many important advances, often with clear utility.\n\ns_00601: The authors also reported a positive correlation in ACE2 and TMPRSS4 expression during the early secretory phase as well as a weak but positive correlation in ACE2, TMPRSS4, and CTSL expression during the window of implantation.\n\ns_00643: TC tracks and intensities have been obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [Knapp et al., 2010].\n\ns_00693: tent with those based on experimental data which find that ozone reductions have a more significant Ozone Corn Soybeans impact on soybeans than corn.\n\ns_00743: Data We utilized data from the newly released Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K:2011).\n\ns_00793: The study used a generic qualitative approach, as we intended to uncover and understand the perspectives of the participants involved in the LLP (Merriam, 1998) .\n\ns_00843: [n.d.] in Friedmann, 1929; Shaffer and others, 2019) .\n\ns_00893: Several studies have also demonstrated that the residual connection would accelerate the convergence and improve the performance of the CNNs (Szegedy et al., 2017) .\n\ns_00943: This is 20 likely to be a bias of the dataset, caused by inhomogeneities in the assimilation procedure used to merge the ERA-Interim first guess with observations (Ross Hoffman, personal communication) .\n\ns_00993: Simplified models are extracted from these experiments and from numerical analysis with 3D flow solvers such as the commercially available code FLOW 3D [2] .\n\ns_01043: The study uses three methods to compare households: Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and Gini coefficients of inequality distributions."
