The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09039: We interpret these variables as indicating higher exposure to food deserts when greater shares of a school's buffer are covered by low access food desert tracts.\n\ns_09089: It shows different characteristics depending on what matric is applied.\n\ns_09139: The Partial Least Squares can be interpreted as a supervised dimensionality reduction technique based on latent decomposition model.\n\ns_09189: The steps used in the construction of the NPSAS:12 strata and PSU variables are described in chapter 6 of the NPSAS:12 data file documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014).\n\ns_09239: The estimates of farm-level benefits used in both studies are based on a consensus of expert opinion.\n\ns_09289: First, due to the demands of attending a 3-day clinic visit, the study population is healthier than the general population, particularly the oldest participants, and may underestimate the true yearly age-related reduction in daily activity.\n\ns_09339: We tested these three methods on different combinations of the input features.\n\ns_09389: (2011) , McNemar's chi square test using the Yates correction was applied to assess differences in accuracy between classifiers as well as to test whether each classifier was equivalent to a random classifier.\n\ns_09439: Indeed, our findings support the hypothesis that decreased body weight determines a reduction in BMD, which in turn determines an increase in vascular calcification.\n\ns_09489: The samples were separated on 12% resolving and 5% stacking SDS-PAGE gels in a mini electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad, USA) at 100 V for 1 h. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, USA) under wet conditions using a trans-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA).\n\ns_09539: Two major overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) i.e.\n\ns_09589: Similarly, Schuerger, Zarrella, and Hotz (1989) found that clinical samples, which we can assume are less emotionally stable, were less consistent than nonclinical samples.\n\ns_09639: Notes: Means and standard deviations [SD] are weighted by sampling weights that adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.\n\ns_09689: Finally, SVM classifier is used for classification of different AD clinical groups.\n\ns_09739: PHOTO CREDIT: PHOTOS.COM EDUCATIONFORUM C oncern about U.S. leadership in science has captured the national spotlight once again (1) .\n\ns_09789: 18 The aim of preprocessing was to spatially normalize the images into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.\n\ns_09839: A mixed quantitative and qualitative research approach was employed by analyzing the collected data throughout different research phases and describing the various mathematical problem-solving strategies demonstrated by elementary pre-service mathematics teachers in each phase.\n\ns_09889: We address issues with irregular sampling by grouping variables that are measured together into the same task, and training the network with multitask learning.\n\ns_09939: Intriguingly, Table 3 in the paper does list one vice president for strategy of an electronics firms as listing \"culture and identity\" as one of the key factors behind the decision to locate in Ireland.\n\ns_09989: The latter, however, is, once again, statistically significant.\n\ns_00041: Common standards such as the GUID and a variety of data definitions and data validation tools enable NDAR to organize heterogeneous research data across many laboratories and repositories.\n\ns_00091: Table 5 shows the odds ratios produced from model 5 of the aggregated data set (column 1) in comparison with the model 5 odds ratios for the six year-by-year disaggregated data sets (columns 2-7).\n\ns_00141: Finally, fathers' reports of being a better than average father were constructed from a single question about which category \"best describes how you feel as a father.\"\n\ns_00191: We evaluate SparseVM on a neuroimaging study of stroke patients containing T2-FLAIR MR brain scans [31] and on a T1 MR brain dataset from the ADNI dataset [27] with simulated sparsity.\n\ns_00241: However, the same differential cannot be directly extrapolated with respect to the pandemic's adverse effects since they are not standardized by age."
