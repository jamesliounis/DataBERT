The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01138: Although there was a significant interaction between age composition and classroom quality, the influence was not consistent with our hypothesis.\n\ns_01188: 2005) and rapidly intensified from category 3 to category 5 in 24 h (Fig.\n\ns_01238: These opposing recommendations highlight the potential limitations with analysis of observational studies and post hoc failed therapeutic trials, which cannot give a definitive depiction of the effects of a successful treatment.\n\ns_01288: Generally these responses emanated from disadvantaged communities where large portions of the population were not engaged in formal employment (Statistics South Africa, 2015) .\n\ns_01338: Using latent class analysis, Sullivan and colleagues (1998) identified six patterns of depressive symptoms in a probability sample of the US population, including a severe typical subtype with a high lifetime occurrence of depressive symptoms, a severe atypical subtype with many depressive symptoms and symptoms characterized by appetite increase and weight gain, and four other subtypes of varying symptom severity [22] .\n\ns_01388: Current markers in the literature have highlighted CFI and C6 proteins, 72 reduced levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids 73 and increased levels of IL-6 74 , however, this is a rapidly developing field so we will plan to undertake both an exploratory and hypothesis-led approach based on the most recent findings at the time of analysis.\n\ns_01438: When the data field T(x, y, t) is expanded into Fourier series,\n, , cos , , sin , \nwhere [A n (x, y), \u03b8 n (x, y)] are amplitude and phase for S n (x, y), and [B n (t), \u03c6 n (t)] are amplitude and phase for PC n (t) (Venegas et al., 1998; Venegas, 2001) .\n\ns_01488: o Clearly identify initial proposals and awards, supplements that involve new funding, and amendments that involve no new funding.\n\ns_01538: Data analysis showed that the existing automatic irrigation scheme, based only on the static ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration under a fi xed water stress threshold (e.g., Hillel and Guron, 1973; Fischbach and Somerholder, 1974) , was likely to be the major cause for this overestimation.\n\ns_01588: This software package contains three major submodels for simulating irregular wave deformations, tidal and waveinduced currents, sediment transport, and coastal morphological changes.\n\ns_01638: The INS is the reference lab and health authority of the national network of laboratories.\n\ns_01688: Finally, the spatial, temporal, and possibly causal relations between brain lesions and brain atrophy [30, 33, 34] , could be studied better if both the atrophy and the lesions were imaged with (near) isotropic spatial resolution of the order of 1 mm.\n\ns_01738: 17 Clinical presentation and histopathologic analysis of malignant cases has been well profiled for small sample sizes.\n\ns_01788: Moreover, the FNR+FPR of the proposed method decreases as \u03c1 increases, indicating that incorporating correlation information among covariates plays an important role in imputation especially when there are no complete cases.\n\ns_01838: Since the dependent variable of this study is continuous, we discuss the eigenvector spatial filtering approach under the OLS framework.\n\ns_01888: Note: the status of academic year of 1993-94 (PER9394R) was not considered in making this vari- The NELS:88/94 and BPS:89/90 linkage file was created to provide a set of variables from the NELS and the BPS datasets that would allow inferences to be made about the students in one dataset, based on the characteristics of students in the other survey.\n\ns_01938: In addition, we describe the different basic research, translational, and clinical studies that are developed in this framework.\n\ns_01988: This knowledge was based on reliable and trusted sources such as Public Health England, the National Health Service, and the World Health Organisation.\n\ns_02038: In relation to performance at KS4 the young people learning for 2/3 years had a mean of 46.04 (SD = 7.36) while those learning for 4/5 years had a mean of 50.2 (SD = 6.84) (see Table 2 for details).\n\ns_02088: CDX-CoV, developed by Codagenix and the Serum Institute of India, represents one of the potential candidates of attenuated vaccines for COVID-19.\n\ns_02138: Studies have proposed alternative approaches to improve national cancer data for LMICs.\n\ns_02188: Figure 2 shows co-citation networks at four trim levels.\n\ns_02271: Distributions differed significantly between groups and in expected directions for markers typically associated with AD, including CSF-A\u03b2, ApoE4 status, hippocampal volume, and FDG-PET (temporoparietal region).\n\ns_02321: In this study, we have leveraged existing computational flood model-based flood zone mapping and risk assessments to quantify the value of various nature-based flood mitigation approaches, develop new nature-based concepts, and map their flood protection services.\n\ns_02371: Future longitudinal studies should examine the pathophysiologic significance of the shift from MTL hyper-to hypometabolism associated with IR."
