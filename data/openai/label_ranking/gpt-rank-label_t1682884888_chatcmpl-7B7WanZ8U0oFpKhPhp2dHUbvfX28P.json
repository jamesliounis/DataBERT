The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04902: Three measurements are considered in this paper: (i) local connectivity, (ii) accessibility to the domestic market, and (iii) accessibility to the global market.\n\ns_04952: Dumniies for missing observations in explanatory variables were included but not shown here.\n\ns_05002: (2014) using disaggregated data for Belgian firms that the impact of a depreciation on export volumes is lower for exporters with higher import shares.\n\ns_05052: Tables 5a-c are consistent with the Multinomial Logit results reported in Table 3 (and   the logit results in Table 4 ), although the results on export intensity are a bit stronger than those in Table 3 .\n\ns_05102: Available survey data do not allow for measurement of changes in child access to iodized salt over time, because the 2006/2007 MICS survey is the only one that contains the relevant information.\n\ns_05152: Bridgman, Qi and Schmitz (2009) find that the sugar yield per ton of beet which was on the upward trend till the act passed started declining post the passage of law.\n\ns_05202: 2016) , and a study in Kenya found a 17 percent take-up rate of formal health insurance (Chemin 2014) .\n\ns_05252: 28 This largely validates the insights provided by the more theoretical research discussed earlier.\n\ns_05302: This paper is limited to addressing questions of interstate allocation of Federal education transfers that can be used more effectively in promoting equity, efficiency and resource mobilization.\n\ns_05352: This paper also complements the previous literature on financial market linkages.\n\ns_05402: The performance of the different estimation techniques is compared based on the relative bias (mean of the error distribution) and the relative standard error.\n\ns_05452: Javorcik and Li (2013) use data from Romania in 1997 -2005 and find that an expansion of global retail chains leads to significant TFP increase in the supplying manufacturing sector.\n\ns_05502: In this study, procedures for exercising rights and accessing services are compared to recognized best practices, where available.\n\ns_05552: In addition to socio-economic, demographic, employment, education and family background information, the surveys contain a series of harmonized questions on specific tasks that the respondent uses in his or her job.\n\ns_05602: The full list of AOGCMs is available in the supplementary materials section of Hirabayashi et al.\n\ns_05652: Diversos estudios han analizado ya la relaci\u00f3n entre talla e ingresos, identificando rendimientos de la salud positivos y significativos en pa\u00edses de ingresos medios y bajos (Schultz, 2002; Strauss y Thomas, 1998; Thomas y Strauss, 1997) .\n\ns_05702: This paper recognizes the critical importance of FMIS systems in expenditure management, without which the desired progress in fiscal discipline and service delivery may be difficult to achieve.\n\ns_05752: Finally, we use the Sakernas survey to generate variables used as controls in the econometric analysis.\n\ns_05802: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 .8 1 Share that paid full price 0 1,000 3,000 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 Price in J$ BDM sample TIOLI sample Columns (1) and (3) show the mean and standard deviation among those who attended demo sessions for the BDM sample and TIOLI sample, respectively.\n\ns_05852: Our first exercise tests the relationship between CAMS-3 data and measures obtained from the Sentinel-5P and MODIS satellite platforms.\n\ns_05902: The most recent analyses of GVC linkages in Africa include Allard et al.\n\ns_05952: Although importers are not identified, the data allows for careful construction of unit values measured at the level of a transaction, extending beyond the traditional use of aggregate level data.\n\ns_06002: Some studies consider the factors affecting fixed-internet access and usage and other aspects of the digital divide.\n\ns_06052: In their seminal paper, A second group of studies notes that holding assets is not the only means to cope with an unexpected \u2026nancial shock.\n\ns_06102: For the overall data set, we can assume that the information is up-to-date on average for 2017."
