The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08602: To verify the robustness of our analytic approach, we estimated several different alternative models, including models with and without normalization for state population size, weighted and unweighted by the state's population size, and GEE models with various assumptions about the correlation structures or the error terms.\n\ns_08652: Other bodies that played significant roles in ensuring the success of the study were: IEA Data Processing Centre in Hamburg, Germany; Statistics Canada, which was responsible for collecting and evaluating the sample and helping participants to adapt the TIMSS sampling design; and Educational Testing Service, which carried out the scaling of the achievement data.\n\ns_08702: Vested et al 26 used some traditional statistical variables, such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and model mean error (ie, bias); the authors use both these parameters.\n\ns_08752: This study used the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted in Arkansas as its data source.\n\ns_08802: Indeed, quantitative data can be obtained from different medical imaging modalities, for example binding potential maps obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) or gray matter (GM) probability maps extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\ns_08852: As well as relying on two academic researchers for data collection, we also developed a small-scale participatory research project that recruited 5 young people to conduct interviews with their peers in their local communities.\n\ns_08902: I used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey or BBS (Robbins et al.\n\ns_08952: [28] In 2010, data are available on currents and sea level near UIC-NARL.\n\ns_09002: In each measure, we used the 2014-2015 school-level data from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data, as the numerator [61].\n\ns_09052: A more advanced TC PMW TB database at 1 km spatial resolution has been developed at NRL-MRY from all available PMW sensors in 1987-2012 with more consistent inter-calibrated TBs at 89 GHz, better eye fixing, and high quality interpolation scheme [68, 69] .\n\ns_09102: Data Preprocessing: All the baseline and screening T1 weighted, bias-fieldcorrected and N3 scaled structural Magnetic Resonance Images were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.\n\ns_09152: After data collection was completed, the data were processed and compiled into a dataset.\n\ns_09202: We were constrained by the data to use this measure as a common denominator so that the maximum number of studies could be included.\n\ns_09252: Second, this study uses cross-sectional data to estimate age-related differences and it is not clear whether the developed metrics are sensitive to change over time, warranting further testing in longitudinal analyses.\n\ns_09302: This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the diagnostic parameters.\n\ns_09352: (2008) and Cuingnet et al.\n\ns_09402: Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01.\n\ns_09452: The primers used in PCR reactions were designed according to the sequences published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [21] .\n\ns_09502: Current review addressed relevant information of SARS-CoV-2, incidence, etiopathogenesis, clinical characteristics with multiorgan involvements in associated comorbid diseases, present and future prospects of clinical trials to prevent, manage and control COVID-19 pandemic infection.\n\ns_09552: Publication bias reflects the possibility that the studies retrieved for the meta-analysis may not include all studies actually conducted, with the most likely omissions being studies that failed to find statistically significant results.\n\ns_09602: The demographic controls are summarized in panel A of online appendix table A.2.\n\ns_09652: For the comparison purpose, the raw cortical thickness data from FreeSurfer, whole brain volume and area calculated by FreeSurfer were also used as features with SVM as the classifier on the same set of classification tasks.\n\ns_09702: We followed the NCES guidelines by using sampling weights for statistical analyses (3).\n\ns_09752: The mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the crossvalidation experiment are shown in Figures 6 and 7 and Table 2 .\n\ns_09802: The results in phase 2 of this study aligned with those found by Almeida and Bruno (2014) , which indicated that strategies used in solving problems may differ based on the type of the problem."
