The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04998: (2010) in using this decomposition to obtain several measures of integration in GVCs at the country-sector level.\n\ns_05048: Table 3 is that it allows us to compare the impact of using export promotion services on different transition probabilities with respect to a common outcome (in the case of Table 3 , we use as a reference exiting from an export market).\n\ns_05098: Finally, there is a challenge in effectively scaling up good models (Bouguen, Filmer, Macours, & Naudeau, 2013) .\n\ns_05148: The robustness result for section 2.3 follow the same pattern as discussed above and has been left out for the sake of brevity.\n\ns_05198: 6 The study design also assigned respondents into 2-month subsidy group during the first phase of the project; these individuals were not included in the follow-up survey.\n\ns_05248: (2016) for a planning perspective.\n\ns_05298: It can be shown that under this situation, if the Government is aiming at maximizing enrollment, it should adjust the per student formula by factors reflecting the elasticity of enrollment with respect to the Federal subsidy of one state relative to that of another.\n\ns_05348: First, we estimate panel regressions.\n\ns_05398: An EM algorithm draws missing data from a prior (often non-informative) distribution and runs an OLS to estimate the coefficients.\n\ns_05448: Specifically, we consider the following specification:\n\ns_05498: The Living Life study fills a gap in the existing data sources on governance, but it can also be analyzed in a complementary fashion with some existing indicators.\n\ns_05548: They analyze if the findings are different from those obtained when using US data from O*NET and investigate the drivers of the heterogeneity in the skill content of jobs across countries but not over time.\n\ns_05598: where , is the daily volume treated in 10,000 m 3 for waste treatment plant w in county b; Vb is the total waste water treated for county b; and is the population of county b.\n\ns_05648: de elementos en el vector ), se tiene que:\n\ns_05698: In his seminal 1998 paper, Allen Schick outlines three objectives of a public finance system: (i) aggregate fiscal discipline -that budget totals should be the result of explicit enforced decisions; (ii) allocative efficiency -that expenditures should be based on government priorities and on effectiveness of public programs; and (iii) operational efficiency -that agencies should produce goods and services at a cost that achieves ongoing efficiency gains and is competitive at market prices (Schick 1998) .\n\ns_05748: Third, results for the 2005-2010 sub-period are in line with evidence available for developed countries -technology is complementary to analytical and soft skills and is labor-saving.\n\ns_05798: These results are consistent with many of the experiments surveyed by McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) , which find business training improves business practices, but that it is harder to measure impacts on business performance in smaller samples.\n\ns_05848: where ( Table 4 reports our results for PM2.5 and NO2 readings from the CAMS-3 monitor.\n\ns_05898: Sections 4, 5, and 6 provide details of the findings.\n\ns_05948: For instance, if a country joined the euro area in 2014 but all transactions in the data are prior to that period, then this country is accounted for as a non-member state.\n\ns_05998: However, such usage can be captured through combining information gained through multiple survey questions regarding whether respondents: (1) have used the internet or not, (2) own a mobile phone, and (3) whether the type of mobile phone they own allows internet access.\n\ns_06048: Additional insigths regarding the relative importance of vis-\u00e0-vis driving large STMs Table A .4.1 shows on-impact STM values using our benchmark calibration and combinations of and which are allowed to vary between 0 and 1 in 0.05 intervals.\n\ns_06098: Finally, for conditions in Syria, we have compiled a novel monthly conflict events data set to use along with nighttime light emissions data that proxies access to utilities.\n\ns_06148: In column (2), we focus on the subsample of documented migrants compared to nonmigrants, and in column (3), we compare undocumented migrants to non-migrants.\n\ns_06198: Reflecting the focus of this paper, and the availability of relevant research, our literature review here is broken into two parts."
