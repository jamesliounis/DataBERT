The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07792: Finally, we examined the plots of the studentized residuals against the independent variables and against the fitted values of the dependent variable.\n\ns_07842: The decision was based on the recommendations contained in a 1993 study by MOW on Financing of Operation and Maintenance of Urban Water Supply in Tanzania.\n\ns_07892: Straight line depreciation is more common, as discussed in Section II, so depreciation rates were adjusted for the empirical work presented in Section\n\ns_07942: The consequence of this lack of a well-defined sample frame is that it is not possible to be as confident in the extrapolation of the findings from the sample to the general population of Onitsha.\n\ns_07992: 25 Only time will tell the extent of Type I error (rejecting the bank solvency hypothesis when it is in fact true) versus Type II error (accepting a false hypothesis) in the selection process followed by the CBR.\n\ns_08042: Review of Lessons and Experience.\n\ns_08092: 22 An abundant body of empirical literature, beginning with Aschauer (1989) , has sought to quantify the contribution of public capital to growth; see Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2007) and Romp and de Haan (2005) for recent overviews.\n\ns_08142: We can then transform (5) Note that the data we have here are: (i) the bottom cut-off point (y), the share of people above that income level, H(y), and (iii) the share of total income they receive, s(y).\n\ns_08192: This demonstration of a beneficial reallocation of public support is not intended as a policy proposal, since it is not practically possible to group students in the way the experiment requires.\n\ns_08242: The present challenge is to work on a departmental level, operating on multiple fronts to address the many ways in which calculus instruction and student support can be improved.\n\ns_08269: \u2022 Organization: The university or government agency responsible for managing the database.\n\ns_08319: The coding script (script.do) allows researchers and organizations to assess the accuracy of our dataset and the quality of the sources.\n\ns_08369: Variants are selected from an iron GWAS meta analysis discovery cohort [30] (n=23,986) and tested in large independent target AD case-control datasets (n=9,251).\n\ns_08419: Another modification to the original DB-SCAN is in the definition of density-reachable chain (Ester et al., 1996) , which is modified to contain only core voxels.\n\ns_08469: The rationale for these anti-Ab therapies has been validated in preclinical models over the last 20 years and is rooted in the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Hardy and Higgins, 1992) .\n\ns_08519: Several research teams came up with the idea to reconstruct and harmonize time series on levels of education attainment -which stems from enrolment data that are more readily available than education stocks.\n\ns_08569: For one baseline scan of each participant, FreeSurfer V4 was employed to automatically label cortical and subcortical tissue classes [3, 4] and to extract target region volume and cortical thickness, as well as to extract total intracranial volume (ICV).\n\ns_08619: Because buprenorphine was approved in 2002 and its use grew substantially thereafter, we allowed for time trends by admitting a set of time indicator main effects as well as time indicator interactions with each provider-type variable.\n\ns_08669: The paper examined the performance of the African countries -Botswana, Egypt, Ghana Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa -in TIMSS-2003.\n\ns_08719: The standard suite of statistics includes the SM and the frequency with which errors lie within specified limits (CF), the RMSE and SD of error, the positive outlier frequency (POF), the maximum duration of positive outlier (MDPO), the negative outlier frequency (NOF) and maximum duration of negative outlier (MDNO).\n\ns_08769: Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the unadjusted significant associations continued after adjustment of covariates in the models.\n\ns_08819: Indeed [15] highlighted that some visualization methods developed to interpret the results of neural networks (for example guided back-propagation and guided grad-CAM) did not depend on model parameters, as they gave the same result with a pretrained network or a randomized one.\n\ns_08869: For instance, they may try to find a way to match this actual evidence with their existing cognitions and conceptions of the world.\n\ns_08919: Over two-dozen different distributions have been suggested for the SAD (Pielou 1977 , Tokeshi 1993 .\n\ns_08969: On the basis of ARM data, 2002 exhibited a significant reduction of tundra albedo by 25 May, 1 to 2 weeks earlier than in other years since 2000."
