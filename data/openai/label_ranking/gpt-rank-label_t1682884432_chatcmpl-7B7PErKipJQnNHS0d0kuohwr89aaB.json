The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01608: The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained in the present study and those from Colombia deposited in GISAID were collated (n=122) and combined with 1461 representative genome sequences from the South America-focused subsampling available from NextStrain (28) as in 20-May-2020 (Suppl Table 1 ) plus reference MN908947.3.\n\ns_01658: [78] highlights the state of the art and remaining challenges for application in a clinical or clinical trial setting.\n\ns_01708: Year of diagnosis, continuous age at diagnosis, sex, race, residency demographic, tumor extent and size, body site, treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, and OS and DSS in months were extracted from the database for analysis.\n\ns_01758: Numerical studies and the ADNI data application also confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing variable selection methods for block-wise missing data in missing completely at random, missing at random, and informative missing scenarios.\n\ns_01808: This study reinforces the suggestion that when analyzing ecological data a spatial analytic approach should be employed.\n\ns_01858: A summary of the results of these imputations is presented in table C9.\n\ns_01908: In summary, we have presented an integrative approach that exemplifies the multidisciplinary integration of basic, translational, and clinical research teams in a single, dynamic framework centered on the NBGB, which gathers the clinical, biomarker, and autopsy samples and information of well-characterized subjects and enables different teams to gather efficiently large and rich data sets for studies across different NDs.\n\ns_01958: It is also important to note that the data pertaining to the current study is modest in nature as compared to some ongoing data collection efforts in the UK (Fancourt et al.\n\ns_02008: These differences were all highly significant statistically (see Table 1 ).\n\ns_02058: 89, 90 Clinical trials in China have shown that convalescent plasma therapy effectively treated COVID-19 in high-risk patients.\n\ns_02108: Diffuse type was more common in the US Hispanics sample (Table 3) .\n\ns_02158: Citations that influence current research activity would however be useful to construct the present knowledge base.\n\ns_02208: Across studies, incident dementia ranged from 3% to 17%.\n\ns_02241: Details about the measurement of hippocampal volume and determination of ApoE4 genotype are available in previous studies.\n\ns_02291: GIS Flood data and benefit-cost analysis results are available for user download.\n\ns_02341: We addressed type 1 error by using HolmBonferroni correction (34) for all analyses.\n\ns_02391: 702 Whitney, M. M., Ullman, D. S., & Codiga, D. L. (2016).\n\ns_02441: The authors of a National Academy of Medicine report defined unnecessary services as \"overuse-beyond evidence-established levels, discretionary use beyond benchmarks; [and] unnecessary choice of higher-cost services,\" and found that $210 billion per year is spent on unnecessary services.\n\ns_02491: All parameters used for simulations, and a complete simulation overview, are provided in Online Methods c, Positive selection classification performance across individual and combined sliding window features.\n\ns_02541: Winkelmann (2006) addressed the empirical issue of how to choose the quantiles and we use that approach in model specification.\n\ns_02591: In addition, the patients filled in a questionnaire with sociodemographic data, a late-onset hypogonadism questionnaire by Morley' and a standardized International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).\n\ns_02641: On the other hand, other studies failed to find any association between stressful life events and cognitive performance in the elderly (Ward et al., 2007; Fountoulakis et al., 2011; Sundstrom et al., 2014 ) and some even showed a possible improvement in cognition following certain stressful events (Deeg et al., 2005) .\n\ns_02691: The second row of the table shows the black share of admissions under the \"race neutral\" counterfactual, in which the observed white admission profile is applied to both blacks and whites.\n\ns_02741: This results in a significant loss of information, especially in light of work by Wolter et al.\n\ns_02791: This study analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a population-based longitudinal study of about 10,700 children born in 2001 and followed through kindergarten (17 (2007) (2008) ."
