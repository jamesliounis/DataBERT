The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09929: 2001 , and Stark and Wang 2001 .\n\ns_09979: Apparently, there are identified factors that directly (positively versus inversely) related to the dependent variable (testing results).\n\ns_00031: For new data structures or experiments, researchers can easily develop a new data definition, often using existing data structures as templates.\n\ns_00081: Finally, regarding the second research question, the results indicate that among Black/African-American (non-Hispanic) respondents, those in the both HSSLRA and CLRA group had 3.6 greater odds of matriculating into an MD/PhD program than no LRA respondents, while those in the only CLRA group had 2.82 greater odds.\n\ns_00131: Conversely, there were much higher proportions of non-Hispanic African Americans, Native Americans/Alaska Natives (p < .10), and men reporting multiple races among teen fathers than among adult fathers.\n\ns_00181: The dataset contains manual segmentations of the ventricles for 104 of the subjects.\n\ns_00231: As of the database's cut-off date (30 st September 2020), there are no essential differences regarding mortality and global fatality from COVID-19 between the two countries.\n\ns_00278: In a study on younger MCI patients, Johnson et al.\n\ns_00328: The relationship between the decline of serum T and the worsening of sexual function has been investigated and confirmed by most of these studies ( Table 3 ).\n\ns_00378: Research results have established that applications of WSIN in at least some situations generate significant private (economic) benefits to growers (Belayneh et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) , and a national survey indicates that growers have positive perceptions of sensor networks .\n\ns_00428: Follow-up MCSUVRs were compared with their corresponding baseline measurements using paired t-test.\n\ns_00478: As stated by Mullis, Martin, Foy, and Arrora (2012) , 42 countries and 14 benchmarking entities participated in TIMSS 2011.\n\ns_00528: To accommodate different timing of peak detectability by species, we chose either the first or third section for a species depending which section had Table 2 .\n\ns_00578: The initiative proposed here is meant to advance and make more widely available platform technologies and data sharing through increased funding and policy initiatives and to enhance collaboration between academe and industry to advance the translation of basic findings as they mature.\n\ns_00628: Entry depends on binding of the S1 subunit of the S protein to a cellular receptor.\n\ns_00670: Morel and Antoine [1994] and Ohlmann [2003] have overcome this by parameterizing attenuation coefficients as a function of surface chlorophyll concentration, available from satellite observations.\n\ns_00720: stitute (1981 , and by several others cited in Ad-\nThe overall economic significance of ozone reams et al.\n\ns_00770: The ECLS-K:2011 employed a complex multi-stage sampling strategy to produce nationally representative estimates of public and private school students (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b).\n\ns_00820: Two of these were the Systemic Enhancement for Education Development (SEED) in the Western Cape, and the Quality Learning Project (QLP) in De Aar (Fleisch, 2006) .\n\ns_00870: In areas where energy development has significantly altered the landscape, several authors have recommended mitigation measures, including erecting artificial nest structures to provide alternative nesting sites and minimizing energy-related disturbances until 45 days after young have fledged (Konrad and Gilmer, 1986; Ng and others 2017; Wiggins and others, 2017) .\n\ns_00920: T1 MRI scans of all the subjects were registered to the MNI space using affine registration and resampled with a spatial resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 .\n\ns_00970: Each intense wind day is assigned to the winter or summer dataset depending on its date of occurrence, t i , with i = 1, .., N , and with N=N w , N s the total number of intense wind days in the winter and summer datasets, respectively.\n\ns_01020: Currently, experiments are carried out by the Centre of Applied Spaceflight and Microgravity (ZARM) in Bremen to investigate the latter.\n\ns_01070: The objective of this study is to undertake a comprehensive comparison of the economic wellbeing of farm and nonfarm households using two national, representative surveys.\n\ns_01120: By examining a national sample of preschoolers, we are able to document the specific conditions under which mixed-age classrooms are most beneficial and least harmful to the development of preschoolers."
