The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09797: 9 For example, Zhang 10 et al used Multiple Kernel Learning to build a classifier for MCI and normal group (NC), which was further used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters.\n\ns_09847: The techniques involved in solving problems are more closely examined by Polya (1957) , who identifies four stages, namely: understanding the problem, planning for solution, carrying out the plan and testing the results.\n\ns_09897: With the prevalence of aging populations around the globe, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant threat to public health -growing from being relatively rare at the start of the 20th century to having a case being reported every 7 seconds around the world [1] .\n\ns_09947: There are three main types of studies: area studies that compare wages across labor markets receiving different numbers of immigrants; natural experiments that look for immigration changes that are independent of developments in local labor markers; and calibration studies that estimate how relative factor supplies affect relative wages for different skill groups and then calculate how immigration with a given skill mix affects relative wages.\n\ns_09997: At any rate, the relatively insignificant contribution of the variables teacher salaries and years of experience (elementary grades) has to be considered.\n\ns_00049: NDAR is linking to dbGaP, dbVar, and the Sequence Read Archive, the federal data repositories containing genetic/genomic data.\n\ns_00099: We fitted a series of nested logistic regression models.\n\ns_00149: Using a nationally representative sample, it tracked children throughout this early developmental period, using both parent interviews and direct child assessments.\n\ns_00199: Since Spar-seVM is both fast and produces more accurate flow fields, its use in clinical studies, such as this one, can reduce errors in propagation of WMH maps and reduce the labor and computational resources needed.\n\ns_00296: The results from the study suggest that impairment in multiple cognitive domains is associated with a more severe outcome over 2 years.\n\ns_00346: 22, 153 or treatment for cancer 22 The issue concerning the relationship existing between morbidities and LOH is relevant since might to be bidirectional.\n\ns_00396: Rates and levels of WSIN adoption, and associated private and environmental benefits, will also depend on other factors relating to growers access to information, risk tolerance, and the availability of technological advice and financing (Feder et al., 1985; Sunding and Zilberman, 2001 ).\n\ns_00446: The participants included in this study were recruited as part of the international Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) [26] .\n\ns_00496: For example, Items 6 and 8 yielded higher slipping parameter estimates for both samples.\n\ns_00546: We found that when we reduced our 18 climate and 13 land cover variables to 14 uncorrelated climate and 10 uncorrelated land cover variables model projections were similar: 45% average range reduction for the full model and 48% for the reduced model (results not shown).\n\ns_00596: \u2022 Explore avenues to facilitate the adaptation of the most promising biomarker candidates for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders to allow interventions at the earliest possible time, when they are most likely to be effective.\n\ns_00688: [2007] modeled an annual mean SST increase of up to 10.2 C and 10.8 C respectively in the Amazon and Orinoco plume area when accounting for chlorophyll absorption.\n\ns_00738: In short, extrapolating other sources).\n\ns_00788: Indeed, the empirical literature demonstrates the importance of early experiences both in and out of school on later educational outcomes (Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 2005;Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, & Yavitz, 2010).\n\ns_00838: The interview schedule was piloted among each of these groups to strengthen validity.\n\ns_00888: Breeding distribution of the Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis) in the United States and southern Canada, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data, 2008-12.\n\ns_00938: Given the imaging data of hippocampus of each subject, different kinds of feature representations could be extracted, such as shape representation and radiomic characterization of image texture measures within the hippocampus regions (Rathore et al., 2017) .\n\ns_00988: Levantine Intermediate Water (MEDOC GROUP, 1970; Schott et al., 1994) .\n\ns_01038: The propellant management system can be optimized such that propellant residuals and loaded propellant are minimized.\n\ns_01088: These findings are consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis."
