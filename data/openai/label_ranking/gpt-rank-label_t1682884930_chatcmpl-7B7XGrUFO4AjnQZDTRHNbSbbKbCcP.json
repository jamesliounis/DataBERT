The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02403: Journal of 629 Geophysical Research, 80, 414-422. doi.org/10.1029/JC080i003p00414.\n\ns_02453: However, given that relatively more family physicians practiced in rural areas, it was not clear whether rurality and specialty were independent predictors.\n\ns_02503: We found 2500 bp windows with sample (row) sorting to provide a balance between performance, with the population genetic statistics showing separability of neutral vs positive classes (Supplementary Figure 1) , and retention of positional information, and chose this window size for future analysis.\n\ns_02553: Dinar, Karagiannis, and Tzouvelekas (2007) evaluated the impact of extension on farm performance in Crete, Greece, using a nonneutral stochastic production frontier model.\n\ns_02603: [53] , who observed a correlation between hyperinsulinemia and increased prostate volume.\n\ns_02653: The first part of the plot shows that memory performance increases as cortisol levels increase (due to the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors or MRs).\n\ns_02703: Trends at the 90 th percentile of the black and white distributions, perhaps more relevant for admission to selective colleges, are similar to those at the mean.\n\ns_02753: The explicit amount (expressed in hectares) and the relative amount (expressed in percent of the total area) was calculated for each common land cover class, for each time step and geographic zone.\n\ns_02803: In the present study, only postnatal measurements of household SES were available, and so our testable hypothesis was limited to assessing whether postnatal household SES modified the associations between preterm birth and cognitive outcomes.\n\ns_02853: It is based upon a linear equation system, and is used mainly in the attempt to understand comparative strengths of direct and indirect relationships among a set of variables (Chou and Bentler 1995) .\n\ns_02903: Although such studies reveal improvements in cost, time, and quality, they also reveal concerns about coverage and response rates.\n\ns_02953: Most of these variables were taken directly from the student data file.\n\ns_03003: Those were compliance monitoring (to ensure that certain formal standards of education are met), diagnostic monitoring (to determine effort-cost ratio in measuring pupils' educational achievements) and performance monitoring (to compare schools and educational districts) (Ferdaus, 2016) .\n\ns_03053: Post-hoc inter-scanner signal repeatability.\n\ns_03103: From this sample, a total of 489 farms were included in our analysis.\n\ns_03153: Having reviewed the types of preferences expressed by individuals, we move on to analyzing how often these preferences are mentioned during village meetings.\n\ns_03203: Figures 3 and 4, which offer a longer view, show that the prices of wheat and maize followed downward trends for decades, reflecting the fact that yields have generally outpaced demand growth, contrary to Malthusian predictions of the 1960's.\n\ns_03253: Harrigan [17] improves substantially upon previous empirical frameworks, but his OECD data have little cross-country variation as high-income countries have similar factor endowments and sectoral output shares.\n\ns_03303: This increased reliance on wholesale funds can also be seen in bank-level data from Bankscope that show an increase in the use of wholesale sources of funds in the 5 years preceding the beginning of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\ns_03353: For comparison purposes, column 1 reproduces the baseline estimates of the outcome equation defined by equation 1.\n\ns_03403: How does the performance of CEEC as a region and individual countries compare with that of our group of comparators?\n\ns_03453: For each four-digit industry, the Census also reports the values of the truncated Her\u2026ndahl index H, representing the sum of squared market shares of the largest 50 \u2026rms in the industry or the entire universe, whichever is lower.\n\ns_03503: The additional controls are GDP per capita (squared), population size and density, fuel exporter dummy, age dependency ratio, offshore financial center dummy, transition country dummy, and year-fixed effects.\n\ns_03553: Columns 1 and 2 use value added per worker as the proxy for productivity, whereas columns 3 and 4 use TFP, measured by the Solow residual.\n\ns_03603: This table shows the weighted-average distance-to-default measure for 9 different regions computed each year."
