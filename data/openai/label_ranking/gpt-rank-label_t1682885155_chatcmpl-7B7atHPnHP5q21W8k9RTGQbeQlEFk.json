The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00087: Abraham's (2002) qualitative study of 75 high school students who participated in a research apprenticeship at a remote field station contextualized and corroborated these findings; participants reported developing more positive views of scientists and the scientific community and a subsequent increase in their interest in and involvement with the sciences.\n\ns_00137: There is a considerable psychometric literature on the advantages and limitations of various ways of measuring development at these ages.\n\ns_00187: (3) by computing the loss over only observed voxels:\nTo define a sparse version of local normalized cross correlation, we first consider the sparsity of each local neighborhood of voxels.\n\ns_00237: Meanwhile, on March 6, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Colombia.\n\ns_00284: However, as 50% of the participants did not show evidence of cognitive impairment -and many also improved -at follow-up, there is indication that the sample consisted of a large number of cognitively healthy persons at low risk of developing dementia in the short time period of the present study.\n\ns_00334: 7, 13, 23, 24 Even though it is well known that calculated free T overestimates the value obtained by equilibrium dialysis, 14 it remains largely employed both for research and clinical purposes.\n\ns_00384: Potential regional and national environmental benefits associated with reductions in N, P, water, and CO 2 emissions were demonstrated using a number of sources.\n\ns_00434: However, the observation of amyloid deposition in the cerebellar cortex of familial AD cases [13, 14] had led to the identification and validation of pons as an alternative reference region [15] .\n\ns_00484: An attribute was included in our Q-matrix if at least two coders agreed that an item measured that attribute (see Table 3 ).\n\ns_00534: Well-documented causal relations between past variability in wetland condition and extent and waterbird numbers provide insights to future change in waterbird populations under climate change.\n\ns_00584: In the language of industry, such efforts would \"derisk\" brain-disorders research and thus decrease the barriers to reentry for companies.\n\ns_00634: The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to, but distinct from the two other coronaviruses, as it has about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and about 50% with MERS-Cov-2.\n\ns_00676: Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 2.2.1.\n\ns_00726: County-sum of values over a threshold relies on proper level indexes of ozone concentrations were con-selection of the threshold, while also ignoring structed using averages of block estimates, lower values which, though maybe not as imporweighted by the proportion of each block overlap-tant as the higher values, may in fact affect plant ping a county.\n\ns_00776: The weights provided with the ECLS-K and used in this analysis, however, are designed to account for such missing data.\n\ns_00826: A system-wide approach requires the \"collective capacity\" of all those within the system \"to communicate and connect, to drive change forward and to align effort\", rather than individualised approaches, which focus on improving the \"individual capacity of single schools\" (Harris, 2010:197-198) .\n\ns_00876: The species is prone to nest abandonment, particularly during the early stages of the nesting cycle (Davy, 1930; Weston, 1968; Fitzner and others, 1977; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; White and Thurow, 1985) .\n\ns_00926: In our study, the four-category label of each subject \u2208 {1,2,3,4} is transformed into a 3-bit binary label encoding its status corresponding to the 3 binary \"larger than\" problems, i.e., the brain degeneration \"larger than normal aging?\n\ns_00976: We have remapped the sea surface height data on the coarser 0.25\u00b0grid of the winds and sea surface temperature by bilinear interpolation.\n\ns_01026: Temperature of the liquid was assumed to remain unchanged: Apart from the fact that liquid temperature was assumed constant, the model has some additional shortcomings and therefore was adapted.\n\ns_01076: The Tukey-Kramer mean comparison tests show that income and wealth differ among some types of households and are similar across others.\n\ns_01126: For example, a large-scale study of pre-kindergarten programs from across the country found that measures of process quality were more strongly associated with children's gains in language, literacy, and social development compared with numerous indicators of structural quality .\n\ns_01176: Despite its simplicity, SHIPS forecasts are comparable to, or more accurate than, those from dynamical models.\n\ns_01226: This model found that baseline MMSE was closely associated with baseline ADAS-Cog scores and the rate of decline on the ADAS-Cog over time.\n\ns_01276: The authors contend that the digital divide also persists in conditions where ICT penetration is high, highlighting examples where new technologies or tools emerge and the population must update their skills before they are able to fully adopt and leverage the new tools available."
