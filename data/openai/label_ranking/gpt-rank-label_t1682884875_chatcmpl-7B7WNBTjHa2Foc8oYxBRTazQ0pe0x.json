The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08678: The content dimension defines the specific subject matter content of school mathematics and science.\n\ns_08728: Therefore, a skill assessment software package 41 has been developed to compute the skill assessment scores automatically using data files containing observed, nowcast, and forecast variables.\n\ns_08778: Willingness to participate in health research was measured on a nominal scale (\"Yes\"/\"No\"/\"Undecided\"), thus a multinomial logistic regression 21 was conducted with the response \"No\" as the baseline category.\n\ns_08828: This is an issue as the advantage of deep learning is precisely to be able to adapt to the rawest data possible.\n\ns_08878: To illustrate this, Festinger points to the impact of information about smoking on smokers' behaviour: in striving for consistency, a smoker may start arguing that smoking is not as dangerous as presented.\n\ns_08928: 1987 , West and Shlesinger 1989 , Dewdney 2000 , Allen et al.\n\ns_08978: [44] While 2 years is too short a time to reach definite conclusions about the skill of forecasts of springtime irradiance, the consistency in forecast breakup dates ( Figure 17) suggests that systematic correlations might exist between forecast and observations at the comparatively long time scale of 2 weeks.\n\ns_09028: Among this research, one study found that high schools with open campus policies had higher rates of motor vehicle accidents among high school students and lower participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) compared to schools with closed campus policies [14] .\n\ns_09078: Figure 7 presents the AMSU-retrieved temperature anomaly distributions at 4000 ft at different stages of Hurricane Rita during 18-21 September, 2015.\n\ns_09128: Tissue-wise intensity normalization for white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid was performed using the expectation maximization based segmentation followed by the piecewise polynomial histogram matching algorithm.\n\ns_09178: In turn, the BPS:12/17 sample was created from the BPS:12/14 sample, using additional data obtained during the BPS:12/14 data collection.\n\ns_09228: Moschini, Lapan, andSobolevsky (1999) modeled the global welfare effects of RR soybeans.\n\ns_09278: Through minute-by-minute analyses of accelerometry data in a relatively large population, this study demonstrated that the amount of physical activity in daily life is progressively lower with age and follows a different daily pattern in older compared with younger individuals.\n\ns_09328: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n\ns_09378: Sections 2-4 describe the data, brain morphometry algorithms and multivariate classification algorithms used in our evaluation.\n\ns_09428: We then added BMD to the model in order to examine i) the independent association of BMD with AC and ii) the mediator effect of BMD in the association between BMI and AC.\n\ns_09478: Sequencing analysis revealed that this unidentified pneumonia was considered to be caused by a novel coronavirus [14, 16] .\n\ns_09528: Further, an obvious conclusion was made, where patients having DM higher in age was compared to non-Diabetes mellitus patients.\n\ns_09578: On the basis of the findings of this study, there appears to be a consistent effect for longitudinal studies that track change over longer time periods to show larger mean-level changes.\n\ns_09628: All subsequent analyses are weighted to adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection and survey nonresponse.\n\ns_09678: Input: Initial dictionary D and image patches {x 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n }.\n\ns_09728: The odds ratios, calculated from the final model, were 1.9 for life sciences versus nonscience and 3.4 for physical sciences/engineering versus nonscience (table S7) .\n\ns_09778: Participants (n \u00bc 109) were evaluated at baseline and in 6-to 12-month intervals following initial evaluation for up to 10 years.\n\ns_09828: In the final stage, the participant examines the solution they obtained.\n\ns_09878: For the tests in Section 4, we adopt the use of a long-short term memory network (LSTM) in the base layer."
