The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02424: We adjusted our model for demographic characteristics and health status of the PCP's patient panel by including its age, race/ ethnicity, sex distributions, and health status distributions, as measured by an Elixhauser comorbidity \"index.\"\n\ns_02474: All data processing, visualization, and analysis was performed using python v3.6.0 or R v4.0.3.\n\ns_02524: Table 1 shows the variable descriptions and summary statistics for the dependent and independent variables.\n\ns_02574: Similar to our results, in the study by Nandeesha et al.\n\ns_02624: SO participated in literature review and in writing the first draft of the manuscript.\n\ns_02674: Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin (2005) have generously provided us extracts from the data used in their study of the role of academic and nonacademic factors in admissions at a number of selective institutions.\n\ns_02724: For this effort, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Landsat Multi-spectral Scanner (MSS) data (1-km and 200-m resolution, respectively) were used.\n\ns_02774: Initially submitted April 10, 2017 ; accepted for publication March 20, 2018 .\n\ns_02824: 2002; Vernon-Feagans and Cox 2013) .\n\ns_02874: This paper will discuss related research, followed by the M PW EB's survey methodology, results, and recommendations.\n\ns_02924: Occupational data were recoded using the Duncan SEI scale as used in HS&B.\n\ns_02974: The data obtained during the focus group survey were processed using the Textalyser web tool.\n\ns_03024: In addition, the overall data analysis was carried out by IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli.\n\ns_03074: The ARMS data for U.S. rice farms collected in 2006 was used to evaluate the relationship between multifunctionality and a set of factors suggested by previous literature.\n\ns_03124: The sample was selected from seven districts in the four South Indian states, The district and block sampling is less relevant for this paper and is described in more detail in Besley et.\n\ns_03174: SeeBrennan, Williams, and Wright (1997) for a spatial-temporal model of an exporting region that gives some hint of the issues involved in modeling imports of food aid for a geographically dispersed population.\n\ns_03224: [Insert Tables 11 and 12 about here]\n\ns_03274: The rest of the paper is structured as follows.\n\ns_03324: ( , 2005,Francois and Manchin (2007), andIwanow and Kirkpatrick (2008).\n\ns_03374: The paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_03424: (1982), chapter 5, give an example.\n\ns_03474: Note: Median regressions on cross-sectional averages for available data in the period 1980-2008.\n\ns_03524: See the Appendices for more information on the construction of our data and key explanatory variables.\n\ns_03574: The variance ratio has been previously used by Ferreira and Gama (2005) and Bakert and Wang The second measure we use is derived from quantile regressions, which estimate the functional relationship among variables at different quantiles (Koenker and Hallock 2001) .\n\ns_03624: Some parts of this section draw on ideas first presented inMattoo and Subramanian (2009)."
