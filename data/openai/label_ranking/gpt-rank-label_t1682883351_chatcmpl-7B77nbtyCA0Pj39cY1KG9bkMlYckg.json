The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01093: In the current study, we used data from the first two waves of data collection (fall 2009 and spring 2010) as we were interested in understanding how classroom characteristics were associated with children's academic gains and behavioral change across one year of preschool.\n\ns_01143: This manuscript also highlights the importance of integrated data and, particularly, of satellite-derived observations and their fusion with hydrographic observations and assimilation into coupled numerical air-sea models.\n\ns_01193: Thus, for participant i51; 2; :::; n at visit j51; 2; :::; n i , the model was ADAS i;j 5 age i 1 education i 1 group i 1 time i;j 1 group i !\n\ns_01243: The paper also explores the extent to which a G20 advisory body may inform a nationally representative data collection strategy within the context of a data collection process that is cognizant of the evolving demands of businesses and users alike.\n\ns_01293: First, the studies included in this review were population-based and utilized a variety of diagnostic survey instruments that are, to varying degrees, imperfect substitutes for clinician-administered structured interviews.\n\ns_01343: 60, 65 The study has therefore included a travelling subject study, an approach that has been previously adopted in other multicenter studies.\n\ns_01393: For the analysis, subset data covering JES (127~142\u00b0E and 34~50\u00b0N) we extracted from the AVHRR Pathfinder SST data during the period of 1985~2002.\n\ns_01443: The report follows up on one released last year by the Government Accountability Office that called on federal agencies to do more to ensure that colleges and other recipients of federal grants do not discriminate against women in mathematics, engineering, and science (The Chronicle, July 29, 2004).\n\ns_01493: Figure 7 compares the spatial frequency distributions of all cotton-grid pointwise relative mean biases, standard deviation ratios, and correlation coeffi cients of the original and redeveloped GOSSYM.\n\ns_01543: The offshore boundary conditions, tides, waves, winds, etc., were provided by a research group at the (Table 1) .\n\ns_01593: The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\ns_01643: Their study showed not only how well the automated methods performed compared to the average expert segmentations, but importantly it also highlighted the variability between experts, which should be taken into account in setting up a database.\n\ns_01693: *Residency demographic and body site were included because of their significance on univariate analysis.\n\ns_01743: The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_01793: Second, this study combined multiple data sources from different time points to explore the associations between the independent and dependent variables.\n\ns_01843: That is the approach used for this report, with an additional adjustment to incorporate the complex sample design into the statistical significance tests of the parameter estimates (described below).\n\ns_01893: In addition, subjects who have been included in previous GWAS studies [21,e11,e12] are identified in the INDD, and a graphicuser interface is being developed to extract specific SNPs for all the subjects.\n\ns_01943: 2011; Umegaki and Todo 2017) .\n\ns_01993: Both were highly statistically significant (p < .0001) (see Table 3 for details).\n\ns_02043: 62, 63 Digital PCR (dPCR) is a breakthrough quantitative analysis technology developed in recent years.\n\ns_02093: Data from Honduras was obtained from a prospective, population-based study, which utilized a combined endoscopy and pathology registry to assess gastric cancer incidence in the rural western region of the country [5] .\n\ns_02143: The study has used various types of data sets and analytical techniques as highlighted below to capture the research trends and also assess this disease influence on the society.\n\ns_02193: Associations were robust to covariates' adjustment.\n\ns_02226: In total, 203 patients with baseline data that included FDG-PET and MR imaging were available for analysis, with decreasing numbers at different follow-up stages ( Table 1) , for a total of 844 observations.\n\ns_02276: The present-day topographic and bathymetric information was from a recent FEMA study [FEMA, 2014]."
