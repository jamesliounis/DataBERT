The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01682: For all these methods, there are several choices to be made on issues such as the type of registration, whether and how to include prior information on expected lesion and atrophy-related change, among others; these choices should be informed in part by comparing results against expert manual analysis.\n\ns_01732: The SEER cause-specific death classification field was used for DSS, a variable that uses algorithms to process a single, disease-specific underlying cause of death from death certificates.\n\ns_01782: In this paper, we utilize the GLM [37] to accommodate not only continuous covariates but also discrete covariates.\n\ns_01832: To obtain unbiased estimates, researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance to take spatial dependence into account, particularly in ecological demographic studies [45] .\n\ns_01882: These two data sets share a fairly extensive set of common variables describing the background characteristics of sample members.\n\ns_01932: Also, for every studied area there is a string field to note any additional comments.\n\ns_01982: In recognising this, a team of leading mental health scientists published a position paper detailing a number of mental health research priorities for the UK in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ns_02032: While KS2 attainment in mathematics and English were slightly better predictors of total points score than playing an instrument, the latter nevertheless made a highly statistically significant contribution (see Table 3 for details).\n\ns_02082: 75 In the clinical samples of 36 COVID-19 patients and 42 patients with other respiratory diseases, the positive and negative prediction of DETECTR were 95 and 100%, respectively, indicating a low false-positive rate.\n\ns_02132: All Hispanic patients defined by the Hispanic/Latino Identification Algorithm (HLIA) were included [17] .\n\ns_02182: For example, it was found that nCoV which some studies have used also identifies papers that cover MERS (Middle-East respiratory syndrome).\n\ns_02265: This study did not control for certain factors that may have partly contributed to the findings.\n\ns_02315: We obtained high resolution scans of manuscript and printed charts from 1844 -1907 with map scales ranging from 1:5,000 to 1:80,000.\n\ns_02365: Among MCI participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interaction ( Table 2) .\n\ns_02415: 208 similar to Whitney and Codiga (2011).\n\ns_02465: 12 It is also difficult to compare LVC studies because there is variability in the measure of LVC depending on the service measured, how it is being measured, and the population for which it is being measured.\n\ns_02515: Because training on full genome alignments is computationally expensive, information from full genomes can be accounted for by performing sliding window analyses using CNN estimates, P(Sw), and analyzing the sliding window estimates with recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.\n\ns_02565: FR i is 1 if the source was used once per month or more frequently and 0 otherwise.\n\ns_02615: The symptoms of MetS (according to WOBASZ 1) were observed in 9.7% of men aged 20-39 years, 28.4% of men aged 40-59 years, and in 34.5% of those aged aged 60-74 [16] .\n\ns_02665: Moreover, certain cytokines, in particular IL-1-Beta and IL-6, which are also known to be involved in the pathophysiology of AD, can activate the HPA axis (Besedovsky and del Rey, 2000) .\n\ns_02715: The black-white gap in test scores among children with the same family incomes is large (Jencks and Phillips, 1998) but mutable.\n\ns_02765: Thus, data for the year 2000 are available for the entire Lake Superior basin but not for Canadian portions of Lake Ontario or Lake Erie.\n\ns_02815: Scores in the full sample ranged from 12.39 to 82.48 on the reading assessment and 10.85 to 69.69 on the mathematics assessment.\n\ns_02865: The dyad total score had a reliability of .72 (Andreassen et al.\n\ns_02915: It may also be advantageous for future online surveys to provide a keyword for AOL."
