The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06395: We use the following household surveys for our empirical analysis: China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) for China, India Human Development Survey (IHDS) for India, and Indonesia\n\ns_06445: * Significant at 10 percent level; * * Significant at 5 percent level; * * * Significant at 1 percent level Notes: Dependent variable is the log of monthly electricity consumption.\n\ns_06495: In this literature, the higher an individual's socioeconomic level, the greater their ability to participate (Lee and Schachter, 2019; Dalton, Burklin and Drummond, 2001; Gastil et al., 2008; Newman, Johnson, and Lown, 2014; Verba and Nie, 1987) .\n\ns_06545: Section 2 describes the sample that responded to the TPO survey.\n\ns_06595: Section 4 compares the outcomes generated by the model with actual developments in the major macroeconomic aggregates occurring up to the year 1992-93 and updates the model to that 5 See, for example, Corden (1985) .\n\ns_06645: A, similar consideration seems to have been at work in Sweden's decision to unify its regulator) system.\n\ns_06695: Therefore, estimation was carried out using two stage least squares, for the period 1990:02 to 1996:06.\n\ns_06745: Around the same time a team of researchers at Chittagong University, led by Professor Yunus, began an action-research program that provided loans to poor households in a few villages.\n\ns_06795: We used the FARA reports for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.\n\ns_06845: A household's assets consist of the stock of productive, social, and locational resources used to generate well-being (see Moser 1998; Siegel and Alwang 1999; Rakodi 1999 ; Carney and others 1999; de Janvry and Sadoulet 2001).\n\ns_06895: (These data should not be considered very reliable.\n\ns_06945: Table 9 explores whether intrinsic differences in the sample account for our results, by excluding children with very different backgrounds from the nested specification.\n\ns_06995: In addition to the variables used to predict housing mobility in Table 6 , we also include information on education, job security and assets while calculating propensity scores.\n\ns_07045: In what follows we summarize and offer brief comments on the salient issues that provide the background situation in which the safeguard measures were applied, including:\n\ns_07095: We present the results for three samples.\n\ns_07145: This suggests the following testable hypothesis:\n\ns_07195: This is very close to the coefficients in Table 4 , which suggests that replacing the age dummies with the continuous variable in age does not substantively alter the estimated effects.\n\ns_07245: The second group is composed of countries that are relatively open in \"theory\" (as revealed by their GATS indices) and practice (as measured by the EBRD indices).\n\ns_07295: The markup ratio is constructed based onLi (1997), which uses the same data set as this paper.\n\ns_07345: Likewise, the OECD in its survey of content of traderelated assistance and capacity building.\n\ns_07395: Data pooling brings about at least two sets of problems that are not always understood or well dealt with in the literature.\n\ns_07445: First, we rerun some of the regressions reported above, replacing total grants with pure grants as the independent variable and comparing the results.\n\ns_07495: The following information is available: To evaluate the quality of service to members it is necessary to compare the actual returns paid to members with a benchmark that shows the returns available on voluntary investments.\n\ns_07545: In this study, a normative '20 percent' debt servicing ratio was posited as the benchmark against which the debt relief resulting from zte application of each of the three proposals could be judged.\n\ns_07595: These data lead to the conclusion that the annual price changes implicit in statistics of gross output value at current (CVIO) and constant (GVIO) prices probably understate changes in the sales price of coal received by the producers."
