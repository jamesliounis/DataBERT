The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09343: Mean Scalar Product Correlation.\n\ns_09393: (Narayana et al., 1988) and gradient distortion (Schmitt, 1985) .\n\ns_09443: RESULTS-Age and cardiovascular risk factors were positively associated while both BMI (r= \u22120.11, p<0.01) and BMD (r=\u22120.17, p<0.0001) were negatively associated with AC severity.\n\ns_09493: These results indicated that propagation of the hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain in Vero E6 cells led to an increasing in the viral titers in each passage.\n\ns_09543: Extensive research to recognize novel pathways and their cross talk to combat this virus in precarious settings is our future positive hope.\n\ns_09593: The distinct patterns of rank-order consistency and mean-level change demonstrated across these two meta-analyses provide definitive support for Block's (1971) original argument that different indexes of continuity-change are relatively independent of one another.\n\ns_09643: These complementary datasets provide consistent evidence of gender gaps that are explained neither by differential rates of participation in extracurricular activities, childcare, and part-time jobs, nor by differences in advanced course taking, past academic achievement, school quality, or cognitive ability.\n\ns_09693: In this way, the p-dimensional vector x i is represented by an m-dimensional vector z i , which means the\n\ns_09743: As more independent variables were included in the nested models, the coefficient remained unchanged for the life science outcome.\n\ns_09793: For pairwise training between nodes of input layers and hidden layers, a conditional Gaussian distribution is used:\nwhere sig is the logistic function: sig\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1 1\u00fee \u00c0x .\n\ns_09843: The discussion of the study addresses different features and issues related to mathematical problem-solving strategies.\n\ns_09893: The final layer computes the parameter vectors of the predictive distribution, which are used to compute log likelihoods during training and dynamic predictions at run-time.\n\ns_09943: To take an example, the Indian-born population in the United States aged 25 and over increased from 304,000 in 1990 to 836,000 by 2000-80 percent of whom have a tertiary education.\n\ns_09993: Nevertheless, close to 50% of the coefficient of determination is reflected in the selection of the specified variables.\n\ns_00045: Furthermore as investigators begin new studies, it should be easier for them to use the GUIDS and existing data standards.\n\ns_00095: Further studies examining science interest have provided evidence for the effectiveness of out-of-school time (OST) activities (Bauer and Bennett, 2003; Sackes et al., 2009) and the influence of teachers, parents, and peers on students' science attitudes (Rodrigues et al., 2009; Sevinc et al., 2011) .\n\ns_00145: In one study, Furstenberg and Harris (1993) analyzed teenage mothers' children from the Baltimore Study, many of whom had also been born to an adolescent father.\n\ns_00195: Figure 8 also shows the percentage of possible improvement, based on the highest reported Dice score, over VoxelMorph that SparseVM achieves.\n\ns_00245: There is almost 15% more \"premature\" mortality in Colombia compared to Argentina in women, and little more than 5% in men.\n\ns_00292: [6] found that deficits in both memory and psychomotor speed/executive function were a stronger predictor of conversion to AD than pure amnestic MCI after approximately 2 and 4 years, respectively.\n\ns_00342: More recently, the CHAMP study showed a decline of serum total T around 2% per year 81 ( Table 3 ).\n\ns_00392: The typical sequence of development in complex applications of new technologies, such as no-till farming or microprocessing, is depicted in Fig.\n\ns_00442: [16] and our group [18] found PVC improved the power to detect longitudinal amyloid burden change.\n\ns_00492: Hence, in comparison to Korean students, as in the Dogan and Tatsuoka (2008) study, Turkish students also did not perform well on the data and chance problems that investigated the chance process and using and evaluating probability models.\n\ns_00542: Our confidence is based on the overlap between the geographic extent of our survey data, the distribution of our focal species during the breeding season, and the timing of the surveys."
