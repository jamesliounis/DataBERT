The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01044: Two studies are particularly relevant to this research.\n\ns_01094: They also reported how many were 3 years of age or younger (M = 7.11, SD = 5.17), 4 \nEstimates to the left of the diagonal correspond to the correlation matrix for 4-year-olds, whereas estimates to the right of the diagonal correspond to the correlation matrix for 3-year-olds.\n\ns_01144: 2000;Goni and Trinanes 2003;Lin et al.\n\ns_01194: We examined pooled clinical trials data to assess the utility of enriching trials using baseline cognition.\n\ns_01244: Ultimately, we found 64 possible studies (see Table 1 ), but on closer review of the studies abstracts, only a few of the papers were useful, as the context of the study was not appropriate, or the paper only narrowly defined a component of digital literacy.\n\ns_01294: The sampling frame for this review included populationbased studies that assessed the heterogeneity of symptom syndromes or trajectories of common mood and anxiety disorders.\n\ns_01344: 45, 52 A further limitation of multivariate studies in the field to date is that in most cases, the findings have not been validated in an independent dataset.\n\ns_01394: These phenomena are interrelated (Wang et al., 2000; Gong et al., 2001; Wu and Wang, 2002; Lin et al., 2002; Gong and Ho, 2003) .\n\ns_01444: When the report's authors eliminated those very large awards and also controlled for age, academic degree, institution, grant type, institute, and year, the disparity decreased.\n\ns_01494: Th e prevailing cultural information on the plant row spacing and density as well as planting and harvest dates are from the Agricultural Statistics Board (1997) and State Cooperative Extension together with published literature.\n\ns_01544: For the verification and validation on CCHE2D-Coast for simulating waves, wave-induced currents, and morphological changes in coastal applications in various laboratory and field scales, one may refer to Ding et al.\n\ns_01594: The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020.\n\ns_01644: and method-related effects, such comparisons between analysis methods should be performed using the same common dataset(s).\n\ns_01694: Data on patients with a diagnosis of mcGTC were obtained from the SEER program for the years 1973 to 2013.\n\ns_01744: In general, the proposed method achieves higher variable selection and prediction accuracy than all other methods for the ADNI data due to incorporating correlation information from incomplete observations.\n\ns_01794: Our findings provided some support to our hypotheses.\n\ns_01844: For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 1 in the text, and was generated by the DAS.\n\ns_01894: The first one contains the demographic, macroscopic, and diagnostic data (Table EA1) .\n\ns_01944: Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.\n\ns_01994: These differences were statistically significant (see Table 1 for details).\n\ns_02044: 103 Most recently, Zhang et al.\n\ns_02094: Finally, data from El Salvador was obtained from a targeted review of databases from the three largest public hospitals (Hospital Rosales, Hospital Zacamil, and Hospital General ISSS).\n\ns_02144: Data for the Policy Documents referencing these top ten co-cited papers was done by accessing altmetrics.com directly from the dimensions database.\n\ns_02194: Significant associations were adjusted for variables differing by genotype (race, APOE4, diabetes, triglycerides, smoking).\n\ns_02227: 25 Five regions of interest (ROIs) were identified through a literature search of regions most frequently cited in differentiating patients with AD and healthy control subjects."
