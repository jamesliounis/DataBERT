The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00491: According to Im and Park (2010) , the results of those studies pointed out that factors contributing to Korean students' high achievement could be grouped under social and instructional factors.\n\ns_00541: We included predictors related to suitable waterbird habitat quality, including the amount and type of wetland basins, and temporally scaled temperature and precipitation covariates.\n\ns_00591: The rapid decrease in costs of sequencing DNA and the increase in the ability to analyze and understand the resulting data have led to a truly remarkable acceleration in identification of genetic contributors to many diseases, which in turn is beginning to influence diagnostics and discovery of therapies throughout medicine.\n\ns_00683: [2012a], the eye cooling (DT Eye ) is here defined as the SST cooling 112 h after compared to 212 h before TC passage averaged over a 200 km 3 200 km box around the TC position.\n\ns_00733: ever, our estimates are similar to experimental plot studies in that soybeans are more sensitive to of measures derived from standard welfare analyozone than is corn (Barse et al., .\n\ns_00783: As reviewed by Quinn & Cooc (2015), such disparities in the workforce can be linked to differential likelihoods to study and persist in science majors in college which, in turn, can be linked to differential preparation, achievement, and attitudes towards science in high school (Chen & Weko, 2009;Griffith, 2010;Riegle-Crumb, King, Grodsky, & Muller, 2012;Price, 2010;Tai, Liu, Maltese, & Fan, 2006;Wang, 2013).\n\ns_00833: Systems theory (Banathy, 1991) gives primacy to the interconnectedness and interdependence of the elements in a system, as well as the evolutionary nature of a system (Banathy & Jenlink, 2004) .\n\ns_00883: Nesting has occurred near active railroads and gravel roads (Rolfe, 1896; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; MacLaren and others, 1988) .\n\ns_00933: The two 256-dimensional feature vector is concatenated and fed to FC2 with 3 output nodes for the deep ordinal ranking model (4 output nodes for the deep multi-category classification model).\n\ns_00983: From the CCMP dataset we consider the instantaneous 6-hourly surface wind velocity vector \u2212 \u2192 u (\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 ) at latitude \u03c6, longi-10 tude \u03bb and time t 6 .\n\ns_01033: The accommodation coefficient can obtain values between 0 (no phase change) and 1 (maximum evaporation rate).\n\ns_01083: Fifty one households in the SCF data reported that they had a farm business and are subsequently excluded from the analysis, leading to 4,391 nonfarm households.\n\ns_01133: Although our hypothesis focused on the overall quality of children's classrooms, we found similar patterns of findings when looking at the specific dimensions of the CLASS, which captured Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support.\n\ns_01183: More notably, one can observe that in the 'without warm eddy' scenario, from 12 UTC 21 September, the flux supply dropped to zero.\n\ns_01233: These findings have significant implications for recommendations to enrich AD clinical trials based on initial severity.\n\ns_01283: Goldstuck (2010) studied this phenomenon in South Africa and identified that there is generally a five year lag from getting access to digital tools till one becomes proficient in its use.\n\ns_01333: Additional epidemiologic replication of these clinical subtypes is needed.\n\ns_01383: For these measures to be embedded in day-to-day clinical practice they ideally should be collectable using methods that (1) are widely available, (2) do not require an excessive amount of patient or clinician time, and that (3) have a reasonable cost.\n\ns_01433: Moreover, the strong correlation in the tropical to subtropical western Pacific of the background SATA and SSTA implies that cooling (warming) in the Subtropical Gyre is accompanied by cooling (warming) in the second mode of the southwestern (northeastern) JES.\n\ns_01483: \"Nevertheless, the gender gap is still 17 percent, which means that women still receive only 85 percent of what men receive when it comes to grant funding,\" the report says.\n\ns_01533: Th is can be measured by correlating the time series.\n\ns_01583: It has been widely used for simulations of waves, currents, sediment transport, and morphological changes in different scales of coasts and estuaries for the purposes of coastal/estuarine erosion protection and flood water management.\n\ns_01633: The time-stamped phylogeny of 122 isolates of Colombia and 1462 representative global SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Figure 2A) showed that the estimated time to the most recent common .\n\ns_01683: For group studies, registration errors due to the presence of severe pathology may be limited by using disease group-specific templates rather than standard healthy control templates, together with appropriate regularization of the registration [55] .\n\ns_01733: Statistically significant increased risk of secondary malignancies was determined by using the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio function in SEER*Stat."
