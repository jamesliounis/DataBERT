The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01265: The goal was to identify how such organisations recognise the challenges digital literacy and to further review the studies which led them to their conclusions.\n\ns_01315: For example, analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey showed that depressive atypicality, a subtype based on patterns of symptoms, was associated with interpersonal dependency, reduced self esteem and stressful life events [22, 24] .\n\ns_01365: To date, the majority of neuroimaging studies investigating abnormalities in the CHR-P and FEP populations have employed univariate analytical methods that allow statistical inferences at the group, rather than the individual level.\n\ns_01415: This correlation pattern consists of a positive correlation between AOI and the second mode SSTA (>0.5) at -2~0-year lag (Fig.\n\ns_01465: The outcomes are the probability of getting funded, the funding requested, the size of the award, and the probability of applying again.\n\ns_01515: Th is study, the fi rst in a series, addressed the fi rst and second objectives, with a focus on model development, including soft ware reengineering, physics improvement, and parameter determination.\n\ns_01565: In order to investigate the performance of these engineering plans, simulations of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses to a hypothetical extreme typhoon event and a monsoon event were performed.\n\ns_01615: Although the sequence data do not represent the actual number of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains, our phylogenetic findings validated the linkage for those epidemiologicallylinked transmission chains with available sequence data.\n\ns_01665: One example application is the group-level lesion probability mapping (LPM) approach, which several studies have used cross-sectionally [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , but few so far have used to investigate longitudinal changes [30, 31] .\n\ns_01715: The median OS and DSS were 11.6 years and 20.1 years, respectively (Fig 1) .\n\ns_01765: In this section, we provide simulation studies to compare the proposed method with existing model selection approaches for handling block-wise missing data, including complete case analysis with the SCAD penalty (CC-SCAD), the single imputation with SCAD penalty (SI-SCAD), the iSFS, the DISCOM, and the DISCOM with Huber's M-estimate (DISCOM-Huber).\n\ns_01815: Drawing from the discussion above, we propose two substantive research hypotheses and one derived from our use of spatial filtering.\n\ns_01865: In addition to official NCES publications, NCES staff and individuals commissioned by NCES produce preliminary research reports that include analyses of survey results, and presentations of technical, methodological, and statistical evaluation issues.\n\ns_01915: Because of the labor, cost, and logistic implications associated with autopsy procedures, the NBGB selects subjects who are followed in the clinical centers, have detailed clinical information, and, in most cases, additional biofluid, neuroimaging, and genetic data/samples to be included in the brain donation program.\n\ns_01965: For the purpose of this paper, we focus on all measures included in the baseline data as completed by all participants.\n\ns_02015: Data on progress between KS2 and KS4 were also collected.\n\ns_02065: 78 This AI model demonstrated better sensitivity than senior radiologists in an analysis of 279 patients.\n\ns_02115: Our study has a number of methodologic limitations.\n\ns_02165: Popularity of a paper can also be seen influenced by journals; papers with high altmetrics score strongly correlate with journals that have high reputation in the field (high impact factor, leading journal of the community).\n\ns_02215: Gait decliners alone had 2.1-5.6 times higher risk for dementia (p<0.05).\n\ns_02248: Despite its potential limitations, this study contributes substantially to the existing literature with regard to the associations between AD and vascular pathologic substrates and brain metabolism.\n\ns_02298: Finally, the central estimate, as well as the low and high end uncertainty estimates, was multiplied by a widely cited damage cost estimate from Hurricane Sandy for NYC as a whole, $19 billion [Gormley, 2012], to provide a final range of damages.\n\ns_02348: vPFC Among all participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was not significant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 baseline diagnosis interaction ( Table 2 ).\n\ns_02398: Journal of Geophysical Research, 113, C09025.\n\ns_02448: All above differences were statistically significant (P \u03fd .001)."
