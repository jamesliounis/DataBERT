The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00464: Results of the DINA model were used to make a detailed comparison between students of these two countries.\n\ns_00514: To evaluate each model's transferability -that is, to project to a new location or time period where predictor variables may be outside the range of the variables used to build the model -we projected to the drought period with models trained with data from the wet years.\n\ns_00564: The need for research investment is highlighted by the growing global prevalence and costs of neurodegenerative disorders (Hebert et al., 2013; Hurd et al., 2013) and a large disinvestment by industry in brain disorders since 2010 (Choi et al., 2014) with the possible exception of Alzheimer disease clinical trials.\n\ns_00614: The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology provided similar recommendations that expanded even further to include consideration of avoidance of spontaneous conception.\n\ns_00656: The 6 hourly NCEP CFSR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction; Climate System Forecast Reanalysis) data are used for the atmospheric boundary conditions [Saha et al., 2010], namely 2 m temperature and moisture, 10 m winds, precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation, and cloud coverage.\n\ns_00706: The Office of Technology Assess-damage estimates from field experiments to rement (1984) has reported that \"up to 90 percent of gion-level damages ignores certain scale-, technolthe damage to crops from air pollutants may be due ogy-and market-specific problems that an ecoto ozone .\n\ns_00756: Finally, we sought to provide context to the size of the race/ethnicity and gender gaps in science by comparing them to the corresponding gaps in mathematics and reading, subjects that have traditionally been the focus of achievement gap studies.\n\ns_00806: An academic noted:\nThey were all speaking from their own experience, their own research, so they weren't speaking from book knowledge; so in that sense, it had emotive value, rather than purely cognitive value (A4).\n\ns_00856: The average home-range size for Ferruginous Hawks was 90.3 km 2 in Washington, and the variability in home range was significantly related to distance from the nest to the nearest irrigated agricultural field (Leary and others, 1998) .\n\ns_00906: The deep learning model was optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004) , the momentum was set to 0.9, and the base learning rate was set to 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .\n\ns_00956: This signal might be due to the fact that SST are provided daily in the OISST 5 dataset, but they have been obtained by performing a bias adjustment using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average, which might anticipate the temporal signal (Reynolds et al., 2007) .\n\ns_01006: Within the German national program \"cooperation project upper stage\", the SART (Space Launcher Systems Analysis) department at DLR in Bremen is developing a tool for this purpose.\n\ns_01056: Their results, using the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances, confirm that the life-cycle stages are important determinants of consumer debt.\n\ns_01106: For example, older research has documented both positive and negative associations between mixed-age classrooms and various aspects of how children spent their time, including time spent in play and children's engagement in conversation (Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993; Goldman, 1981; Urberg & Kaplan, 1986; Winsler et al., 2002) .\n\ns_01156: These TCHP fields are now used qualitatively by NHC forecasters for subjective TC intensity forecasts and quantitatively in the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS; DeMaria and Kaplan 1994).\n\ns_01206: Our meta-database of clinical trials spans more than two decades, and secular changes in the conduct of clinical trials over this time frame could have affected results.\n\ns_01256: Considering the framework for assessing digital literacy identified in Table 3 , the G20 requires a standardized data collection process to measure the levels of digital literacy across member nations informed by this framework.\n\ns_01306: In a representative sample of adults from Zurich, Merikangas and colleagues (2003) used log-linear models to investigate the relation between anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety and depression.\n\ns_01356: This consortium aims to recruit a large sample of CHR-P and FEP participants and to collect a number of multimodal imaging measures (ie, structural, resting state functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging data), which will be integrated with psychopathological, sociodemographic, genetic, metabolomic, proteomic, immunological and cognitive data with the aim of improving outcome prediction.\n\ns_01406: The causes of the interannual variability of JES SSTA have been investigated using correlation analysis between the n-th mode JES SSTA and background SLPA, SATA, SSTA, and four climate indices: AOI, NPI, MEI, and WPI.\n\ns_01456: It cited Title IX as the basis of its recommendations and singled out the Energy Department, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the science foundation as needing to make changes.\n\ns_01506: Th us, these climate and crop models need to be coupled to better understand the interactions between regional climates, ecosystems, and agricultural crops (Tsvetsinskaya et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Osborne et al., 2009) .\n\ns_01556: The intercomparisons of the maximum water stages and bed changes revealed that Case 7, i.e.\n\ns_01606: We attempted to overcome this by undertaking sensitivity analyses and contrasting the results with the available epidemiological .\n\ns_01656: Partly simulated image data in which the true change is known, as used in their study, may also facilitate such developments in MS, especially when based on representative images from MS patients and made widely available as recommended below."
