The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08849: To find the regions most related to Alzheimer's disease according to the CNN, we computed a mask based on the subset of images of AD subjects that were in the training set and validation set and all correctly classified by the network.\n\ns_08899: As Brannen and Nilsen (2005: 423) point out, many people 'find the external and structural forces that shape their lives more difficult to comprehend and therefore to talk about'.\n\ns_08949: The XRange column indicates spatial extent.\n\ns_08999: In years where boat access leads breakup at UIC-NARL, coastal ice broke up in stages from the south (near the residential areas of Barrow) to the north (at the reference point of this study).\n\ns_09049: That is, a one-point increase in the ratio of the percent of white school students to the percent of neighborhood white composition is associated with a 735% increase in the odds of a tract maintaining an open campus policy (OR = 8.348; 95% CI = 1.001 to 69.647).\n\ns_09099: This conical scan pattern of PMW measurements provides for a consistent spatial resolution which is crucial in analysis of TC detection, intensity, structure, and monitoring [9, 10] .\n\ns_09149: Preprocessing the MRI involved skull stripping and registration to talairach coordinates as a part of the ADNI preprocessing pipeline.\n\ns_09199: Table 36 shows the interview questions (forms) with the highest rates of help-text access.\n\ns_09249: Policymakers and consumers will benefit from better estimates of the farm-level benefits, because information costs are part of the cost of regulation.\n\ns_09299: The importance of employment in maintaining daily activity is consistent with previous work in 20-60-year olds in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (15) and confirms the idea that having consistent employment is an important driver of physical activity in middleaged and older individuals.\n\ns_09349: This coefficient will yield an indication about whether there will be mainly contraction or expansion in both of the regions, and their correlation.\n\ns_09399: Experimental results are reported in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6.\n\ns_09449: Whole-body BMD was measured by DEXA using the Lunar Prodigy Scanner with version 10.51.006 software (General Electric, Madison, WI) 13 .\n\ns_09499: The common key mutations and similar travel histories of the closely clustered cases may indicate possible links between our case and the Iranian epidemic.\n\ns_09549: ACE2 is also significantly expressed in other tissues like heart, renal, and gastrointestinal tract [34, 35] .\n\ns_09599: This omission in the longitudinal database is more conspicuous when one considers the wealth of studies arguing that culture, especially in the particular forms found in Asian countries, has a profound effect on psychological functioning (e.g., Markus & Kityama, 1991) .\n\ns_09649: However, the richest model specification (column 7) that conditions on school FE all but removes the SES gap in weekly homework time.\n\ns_09699: Given a finite training set of signals, in this case thickness features, X = (x 1 , x 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n ) in R p\u00d7n image patches.\n\ns_09749: Robert H. Tai,* Christine Qi Liu, Adam V. Maltese, Xitao Fan\nYoung adolescents who expected to have a career in science were more likely to graduate from college with a science degree, emphasizing the importance of early encouragement.\n\ns_09799: The number of PCA eigenvectors was chosen to retain 95% variance, and the feature after dimension reduction was used as the feature input of SVM.\n\ns_09849: In the first stage, the student needs to understand the words used in stating the problem, identify what he/she is asked to find or show, restate the problem in his/her own words, think of a picture or diagram that might help in understanding the problem, and then examine whether there is enough information to find a solution.\n\ns_09899: For the task-specific layers, variables can be grouped according to the types of outputs, with layer z c,t for continuous-valued longitudinal variables, z b,t for binary longitudinal variables and z e,t for events.\n\ns_09949: 31 The fact that the share of India's IT exports-North America 62 percent, Europe 24 percent Japan 4 percent-is roughly the average of these regions share of India's skill migration and the region's share of global IT industry-is suggestive that incorporating the size and skills of diasporas in gravity models of global IT trade may be worthwhile.\n\ns_09999: Though Cities such as New York City, Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Houston ranked ahead of Chicago, the overall findings showed a widening achievement gap between urban and suburban districts that is of concern to the Obama administration."
