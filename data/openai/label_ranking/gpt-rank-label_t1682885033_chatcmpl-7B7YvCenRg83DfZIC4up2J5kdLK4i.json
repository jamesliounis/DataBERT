The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01173: 10c), which shows that in the presence of warm ocean eddies, TCHP could have reached *80-90 kJ cm -2 , a more than 30 % increase as compared to the non-eddy encountering scenario, that is, under normal climatological conditions (Fig.\n\ns_01223: Inclusion criteria for the present analysis were (1) diagnosis of dementia due to AD; (2) completed the MMSE at baseline; (3) completed at least one assessment on the ADAS-Cog.\n\ns_01273: One of the indicators included in the index was a measurement of the shift towards knowledge-intensive activities, which was informed by a survey of industry experts and not a representative sampling strategy of businesses across the selected countries.\n\ns_01323: On the other hand, a study of communitydwelling adults aged 65 and older from areas of North Carolina showed that the positive relation between age and depressive symptoms was driven primarily by differences between cohorts, and that adjustment for indicators of the life course (i.e., marriage, socioeconomic status, employment status), physiological declines, and sex compositions largely explained these cohort effects [67] .\n\ns_01373: 20, 21 Although some neuroimaging studies have reported findings that may differentiate patients with distinct clinical outcomes, 22 these have yet to be externally validated and translated into tools that can be used in clinical practice.\n\ns_01423: Let [X(t), T(t)] be the time series of the environment variables and the n-th mode SSTA, respectively, which are normalized by their standard deviations.\n\ns_01473: Ideally, each agency would have a single data system rather than separate systems for each subagency or grant program and the agencies would agree on a common list of key data elements.\n\ns_01523: For the relative mean bias, the occurrence of a larger frequency closer to 0.0 on the horizontal axis indicates that the model simulates more grids with smaller errors relative to observations, and hence is more realistic.\n\ns_01573: The bottom roughness coefficient, i.e., Manning's n, was set to 0.025 on the sea bed, and 0.033 on the river bed based on the 1D river simulation model.\n\ns_01623: The relative proportion of expected importations of COVID-19 by country to Colombia was inferred by taking into account SARS-CoV-2 incidence per international air passengers arriving in Colombia and the available flight travel.\n\ns_01673: It was shown for 2D images that the number of changing T2 lesions observed from the beginning to the end of a trial is statistically more powerful than the number of gadoliniumenhancing lesions from monthly scans [80] .\n\ns_01723: Survival analysis from Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the 5-year OS and DSS rates for mcGTCs were 63.3% and 62.8%, respectively.\n\ns_01773: As the missing rate of this dataset is nearly 70%, it is important to fully utilize incomplete observations such as with the proposed method.\n\ns_01823: However, as the goal of spatial filtering is to account for spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable, E can be created based on Moran's I [49, 51] , a commonly used measure of global spatial autocorrelation [69] .\n\ns_01873: Table C6 presents actual persistence and attainment rates for both BPS:90/94 and NELS:88/94 students and proportions of students according to their timing of postsecondary education enrollment, enrollment status, sex, raceethnicity, and SES in three types of postsecondary education institutions.\n\ns_01923: The assistant prepares and presents the specimen containers during the dissection and records the prosector's observations for later entry to the database.\n\ns_01973: However, a crude comparison to the Census data suggests that employed individuals and students were oversampled, while those who are unable to work or are retired were undersampled.\n\ns_02023: Analyses were also undertaken in relation to the length of time that the students had been learning.\n\ns_02073: At present, there are more than 100 institutions conducting related clinical trials on attenuated vaccines.\n\ns_02123: IARC country cancer incidence rates (GLOBOCAN 2008) are presented for comparison purposes [6] .\n\ns_02173: The co-cited papers were identified at four levels (trim levels) to have a deeper insight of the core knowledge base: Level 1 identified 51 papers co-cited 77 or more times; Level 2 identified 26 papers co-cited 126 or more times; Level 3 identified 10 papers co-cited 277 or more times, and Level 4 identified 5 papers co-cited 463 or more times.\n\ns_02256: The independent variables of the models included age, WMHs, and an interaction of WMHs and an indicator variable to denote the brain region measured with FDG-PET in the outcome (ie, 0 for temporoparietal and 1 for frontal).\n\ns_02306: Because maps and charts were drawn at different times and sometimes with different definitions of shoreline (the \"topographic zero\", which might be defined relative to the observed mean sea level, mean lower low water or some other tidal datum), we adjusted elevations to a common vertical datum, in this case, NAVD88, adjusting for sea level rise.\n\ns_02356: Participants were clinically diagnosed at the screening and each subsequent visit based on standardized criteria (19) .\n\ns_02406: Goodrich et al., 1987;
