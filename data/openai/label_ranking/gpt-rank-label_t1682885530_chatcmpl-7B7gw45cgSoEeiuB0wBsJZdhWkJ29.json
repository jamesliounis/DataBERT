The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08167: Using (1) and (2), we can link G(y) and H(y): Expression (5) is the key relationship that we fit in order to get the Pareto constant and to interpolate for the values that we do not have in the original data.\n\ns_08217: 3 (Around three-quarters of U.S. students attend a public university.\n\ns_08294: Then, individual participants who received a degree in the aforementioned fields are selected for participation.\n\ns_08344: Each line of coding identifies the measure to be coded, the scale of the measure, the targeted country and the period for which the measure is implemented.\n\ns_08394: A binomial test 'heatmap' plot is generated to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with an excess [observed(obs)\u2265expected (exp)] or deficit (obs<exp) number of associated SNPs, and empirical P-values (adjusted for testing all 144 subsets) are calculated via permutation.\n\ns_08444: Therefore, researchers are focusing their techniques in analyzing the pattern of the entire brain.\n\ns_08494: In a primary prevention trial, the endpoint might be time to conversion to a stage 1 biomarker or, for a secondary prevention trial, time to conversion of a stage 2 biomarker.\n\ns_08544: It served as the basis for the projections (Lutz et al.\n\ns_08594: An interesting future topic is to investigate whether these nonlinear models can help improve the prediction rates as well as derive biologically meaningful results.\n\ns_08644: Therefore, despite the overall increase in the number of buprenorphine providers, there were relatively few rural providers in 2011, with a total of 118 buprenorphine-providing substance abuse treatment facilities, 28 buprenorphine-providing opioid treatment programs, and 852 waivered physicians in the nation's 1,231 rural counties.\n\ns_08694: Compared to other African countries that took part in the study, the performance of Ghana and South Africa were the lowest (Table 1).\n\ns_08744: Wallhead et al 36 use skill metrics such as mean squared error to assess the skill or uncertainty of plankton model predictions.\n\ns_08794: In fact, racial/ethnic minority participants (Black or Hispanic) were more likely to express their willingness to participate in health research if provided the opportunity than White respondents.\n\ns_08844: To confirm this visual observation, the list of the 5 ROIs in which the mask has the lowest values was extracted for each fold.\n\ns_08894: More importantly, our in-depth interviews with Anna and others also shed light on what lay behind young people's continued optimism about their personal futures.\n\ns_08944: Thus, Sugihara's random fraction model of SADs (1980) converges to the lognormal (Pielou 1975) as do many others (e.g.\n\ns_08994: Shapiro and Barnes, 1991].\n\ns_09044: We collected data on open campus policy holding during the fall of 2017 for all public high schools (not including charter or alternative schools) in the state of Oregon (n = 200) using the Oregon Department of Education's \"Oregon School Directory\" [48] .\n\ns_09094: It clearly shows evaluations of TC's key characteristics for purposes of a global TC monitoring and tracking.\n\ns_09144: We find directionsm in the combined product space of imaging modalities, M, and directions\u0177 in the clinical response space, Y, that explain their association in the sense of their common variance.\n\ns_09194: NPSAS statisticians determined institution measures of size using enrollment data from the most recent IPEDS EF and E12 components.\n\ns_09244: Yet vocal critics persist, their arguments based in part on their beliefs that neither farmers nor other members of society benefit from these technologies (see Benbrook, 2001;Duffy & Ernst, 1999;Hart, 1999).\n\ns_09294: Two-timed trials were conducted to derive usual gait speed in m/s, with the faster used for analysis.\n\ns_09344: Section 4 describes the different vector classification methods to distinguish AD from NL with the aid of our diagnostic parameters.\n\ns_09394: Again, differences between classifiers were small, although statistically significant."
