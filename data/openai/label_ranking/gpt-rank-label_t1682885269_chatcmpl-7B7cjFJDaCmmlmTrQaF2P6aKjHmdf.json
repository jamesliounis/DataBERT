The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00240: It is also worth mentioning how the gender gap in Argentina is notorious.\n\ns_00287: Then, a series of independent t tests was performed, comparing the single-domain MCI groups as well as the multidomain MCI group with the group showing normal test results (noMCI group).\n\ns_00337: 51 Age-related male hypogonadism: Results from large cohorts studies involving middle-aged to older men One of the first studies investigating serum T in aging men by a longitudinal design was the New Mexico Process Study 52 that followed preliminary data previously obtained by cross-sectional studies.\n\ns_00387: For illustration purposes, we apply basic BMP cost information to the region that makes up the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which sets limits on N, P, and sediment entering receiving waters.\n\ns_00437: The estimated sample size needed for anti-amyloid trials were similar between the two studies.\n\ns_00487: Slipping, guessing and discrimination parameter estimates for Korean and Turkish samples are presented in Table 6 .\n\ns_00537: A grid point was determined suitable if the estimated probability of occurrence (over the time period for the baseline or future data) was greater than 0.5.\n\ns_00587: Cancer biologists and clinicians faced scientific challenges, but they also benefited from scientific opportunity-direct access to living tumor tissue excised in biopsies or in surgical treatments and in more recent years the ability to sequence the genomes of large numbers of cancer cells from diverse tumor types.\n\ns_00637: Overall, the endometrium appears to have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression; this susceptibility could vary depending on viral cell entry\n\ns_00679: Emanuel  32.6 6 1.0 34.5 6 1.0 31.9 6 1.1 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 [1987] finds that under typical conditions the MPI at 29 C SST is about 891 hPa.\n\ns_00729: The mean elasticity tionally, Heck et al.\n\ns_00779: For instance, science assessments were not required until school year 2007-08, after the completion of the original ECLS-K data collection (U.S. Department of Education, 2004).\n\ns_00829: Harris and Jones (2010) emphasise that systemwide change is unlikely to succeed without structures for collaboration.\n\ns_00879: When possible, Olendorff (1993) recommended applying treatments (for example, chaining, disking, plowing, or burning) during the nonnesting season to avoid direct impacts to nesting Ferruginous Hawks, their nests, and their prey during the nesting season.\n\ns_00929: In these studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely adopted to learn informative imaging features by optimizing a pattern recognition cost function.\n\ns_00979: The error on the estimates given by equation 2 is computed as the standard deviation related to the sum involved in the formulas, divided by the square root of N w,s , the number of days in the considered region when at least one intense wind event has been recorded.\n\ns_01029: This coefficient is a measure for that chance of a molecule to undergo a phase change.\n\ns_01079: The Gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula: where the households are ranked in ascending order of y i an i y and n i are the mean and number of observation of group i, respectively.\n\ns_01129: We discuss the take-home messages of our work in the following.\n\ns_01179: In recent years, ultra-high-resolution (1-6 m) bathymetric and topographic data from airborne LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) optical remote sensing instruments, in addition to high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs), have been incorporated into the SLOSH basin-building process.\n\ns_01229: However, these differences at the end of trials are primarily due to differences in baseline ADAS-Cog scores.\n\ns_01279: Our interest however was to focus on studies which attempted to define digital literacy.\n\ns_01329: Further information on the validity of common diagnostic instruments can be found elsewhere [72] .\n\ns_01379: One of the core aims of the project is to integrate neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and peripheral biomarker data to facilitate the prediction of psychosis onset, clinical and functional outcomes.\n\ns_01429: The background SATA is highly correlated to the first mode SSTA at -12-month to zero lag with the strongest correlation in the central JES exhibiting a similar pattern with spatial amplitude of the first mode SSTA (Fig."
