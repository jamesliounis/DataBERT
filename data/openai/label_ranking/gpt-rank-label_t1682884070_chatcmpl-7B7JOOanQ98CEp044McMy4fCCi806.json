The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09460: For multiple sequence alignment, complete (>29,000bp) and high-coverage genomes (n = 3970) were used from the GISAID database.\n\ns_09510: Some studies stated that diabetes mellitus (DM) was associated with more severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome and increased mortality [25, 98] .\n\ns_09560: For example, Twenge (2000 Twenge ( , 2001 Twenge ( , 2002 has reported that younger cohorts are more neurotic and extraverted than older cohorts.\n\ns_09610: The two datasets are broadly similar, which is unsurprising given that both are nationally representative cross-sections of similar time periods.\n\ns_09660: In this paper, a spherical sparse coding and dictionary learning method is proposed and it achieves relatively high classification results on publicly available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 dataset (N = 201) which contains structural MRI data of four clinical groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), later MCI (LMCI) and AD.\n\ns_09710: Next, we considered the estimated probabilities of earning science baccalaureate degrees produced by the final model comparison (see figure on page 1143).\n\ns_09760: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate the model performance.\n\ns_09810: The following table represents the frequencies and percentages of these responses.\n\ns_09860: For a given longitudinal study, let there be N patients with observations made at time t, for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T cens where T cens denotes an administrative censoring time 2 .\n\ns_09910: 2001) , we have taken a modest step to measuring part of this loss by describing the characteristics of the US-resident Indian- Turning to Ireland, we need to know more about the backgrounds of Irish software workers from detailed survey evidence to gauge the impact of returning emigrants on the development of Irish software firms (see, however, the work of Sands, this volume).\n\ns_09960: The state board all so provides data pertaining to percent of low income students by school district, the years of experience for teachers at the elementary and high school levels by school districts, and most importantly the percent of students at/or exceeding standards (high school and elementary) levels by school district.\n\ns_00012: This article describes the basic structure of NDAR, the strategies that the database has used to try to overcome the issues of data heterogeneity, solutions to some of the problems in making data from human subjects widely available to the research community, and the results of these efforts so far.\n\ns_00062: This study's findings, as with all quantitative research, should be considered with respect to limitations.\n\ns_00112: Although the level of nonresponse is a limitation of this data set (West, 2007), as with many other sources of information about fathers, nonresponse bias analyses conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics suggested that there were not many differences between respondents and nonrespondents to the father surveys that would lead to nonresponse bias (National Center for Education Statistics, 2005).\n\ns_00162: In our experiments, we focus on atlas-based registration, registering an atlas, or reference scan, to each subject scan.\n\ns_00212: When we consider age composition, some dimensions of the impact of the pandemic between the two countries become much more evident, as well as the previously observed differences with respect to sex in context, showing that higher rates would correspond to a more aged population.\n\ns_00259: In a much smaller longitudinal study by Whitwell et al.\n\ns_00309: htm) on the basis of CV events reported in some of the T trials.\n\ns_00359: To arrive at these average values, we estimated total business sales for each operation type using regional sales data for horticultural operations from the USDA Census of Agriculture: Census of Horticultural Specialties (USDA, 2010b) and then adjusted for each operation type according to the proportions of operations in each operation type derived from a survey of ornamental plant producers that was completed as part of this project .\n\ns_00409: More recently, Brendel et al.\n\ns_00459: Since IEA (The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) used 3PL IRT model for TIMSS analyses, results of 3PL IRT model were also provided for two samples before presenting main DINA model results (see Table 5 ).\n\ns_00509: Statistically downscaled data refine projections from global circulation models (GCMs) using an empirical relationship to local physiography (e.g.\n\ns_00559: The science must be tractable-even if difficult-and there must be an appropriate workforce in the field in question or workers willing to enter from related fields.\n\ns_00609: The authors reported high expression of TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B and L, FURIN, MX1, and BSG throughout the menstrual cycle.\n\ns_00651: That agrees with Masson and Delecluse [2001] and Balaguru et al."
