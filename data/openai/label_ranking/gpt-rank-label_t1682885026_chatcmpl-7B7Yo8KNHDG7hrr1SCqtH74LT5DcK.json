The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09932: Their industry analysis, however, was conducted at too aggregated an industry level to get a good feel for how the software sector was affected in particular.\n\ns_09982: Again, these findings pertain to the 25 lowest paying school districts in terms of average salaries.\n\ns_00034: The use of the NDAR GUID makes available data collected from a single participant across multiple studies by different investigators, saving effort and resources for both investigators and research subjects without redundant visits, blood draws, questionnaire administration, or imaging.\n\ns_00084: The authors note that some control variables were not included in our data set.\n\ns_00134: Table 1 documented five child health and development measures that were significantly related to having a teenage father.\n\ns_00184: However, from our experiments we found a larger neighborhood size of 15 3 leads to better performance for clinical images, so we report results with a neighborhood size of 15 3 .\n\ns_00234: It is evident that its effect has been heterogeneous in the different continents, and there is a consensus that it has been less harmful in Asia, Africa, and Oceania than in Europe or America.\n\ns_00281: This is practical, but the robustness of the cognitive findings may suffer as healthy participants may be categorized as cognitively impaired based on single and possibly incidental poor scores.\n\ns_00331: By taking into account all the issues mentioned before, it becomes clear that the comparison of the results coming from different studies suffers from bias due to methodological differences when measuring serum T and its decline during aging.\n\ns_00381: T is equal to R, the reduction in consumption, emissions, or runoff (l) for operation type j in region k, times O is the number of operations of type j in region k, divided by S, the total sales of operation type j in region k. The average magnitudes of potential environmental benefits per million dollars of output for each operation type per region, and for the United States, are presented in Table 6 .\n\ns_00431: In addition, the observed longitudinal change in MCSUVR agreed well (Pearson r = 0.66, p = 1.03E-8) when cerebellar cortex and brain stem were used as the reference region.\n\ns_00481: By means of examining the attribute prevalence estimates (see Table 7 ), it was concluded that Turkish students were particularly weak in mastering Attributes 1, 8, and 13 when compared to their Korean peers.\n\ns_00531: We used data from high-quality surveys (reported by the BBS as ''run type 1'') for 77 routes: these were conducted within the correct survey window and not during poor weather.\n\ns_00581: An excellent example of such an unexpected benefit is the diverse science underpinning intelligent learning systems, which has led to an enormous number of applications, such as speech-recognition technology and powerful data-analysis tools that are used throughout academe, many industries, and government.\n\ns_00631: However, it is important to note that none of the highly expressed proteases reported in this study are known to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\ns_00673: While CDOM commonly has terrestrial sources (eg.\n\ns_00723: (1986) , for example, in their analysis of averages, such as the 7-hour seasonal mean, may cash grain farmers in Illinois.\n\ns_00773: Our finding contrasts with the science gender gap observed at the end of third grade, estimated at approximately one quarter of a standard deviation (Kohlhaas et al., 2010;Quinn & Cooc, 2015).\n\ns_00823: However, more research into district change efforts are required in order to provide empirical guidance that district leaders might utilise to help them bring about system-wide change in their districts (Rorrer et al., 2008) .\n\ns_00873: In South Dakota, Ferruginous Hawks preferentially placed ground nests in lightly grazed pastures or idle areas (Lokemoen and Duebbert, 1976; Blair, 1978; Blair and Schitoskey, 1982) .\n\ns_00923: In total, 21242 spatial translated images, and 84824 non-rigid registered images were generated as the augmented dataset for training the deep learning model.\n\ns_00973: The fact that surface thermal anomalies persist for at least 30 days, confirms thus the potential of (sub-)monthly scale feedbacks.\n\ns_01023: Like PMP, EUCES is a propellant management tool which calculated propellant conditions in tanks and pipelines [3] [4].\n\ns_01073: Three methods are used to compare the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households: the Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and Gini coefficients.\n\ns_01123: During the fall of 2009, teachers reported how many children were in their classroom (M = 17.15, SD = 2.21)."
