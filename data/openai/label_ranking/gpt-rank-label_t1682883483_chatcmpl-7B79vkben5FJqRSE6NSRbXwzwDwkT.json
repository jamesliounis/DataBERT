The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02196: We adopted Cox proportional hazard model to estimate hazard ratios, with and without adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities (diabetes,\n\ns_02229: When the analysis was restricted to those with available CSF-A\u03b2 data, similar results were observed for relationships between WMHs and glucose metabolism, with almost identical coefficients (model 2).\n\ns_02279: These maps have been frequently used for historical ecology studies [e.g., Bromberg and Bertness, 2005;Grossinger et al., 2005].\n\ns_02329: In this study, we examined the relationships among peripheral IR, baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion, and mean FDG metabolism within several ROIs targeted by AD and two control regions.\n\ns_02379: 661 doi.org/10.1029/2007JC004716.\n\ns_02429: The population is another concern, as different studies have used different data sets, including Medicare data, Medicaid data, and commercial insurance data.\n\ns_02479: We used a CNN architecture similar to a previous study 7 .\n\ns_02529: Sufficient detail was available to use 810 observations from the survey.\n\ns_02579: Results: In the study group 91 (60.3%) cases of metabolic syndrome (MetS) were diagnosed, while in the control group 71 (46.1%) men met the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome (p = 0.018).\n\ns_02629: JP participated in literature review and revised the article.\n\ns_02679: The policy question at the center of our empirical analysis is whether there will be enough black 4 These data are from the Expanded College and Beyond (ECB) study assembled by the Andrew W.
