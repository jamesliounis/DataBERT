The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00268: The included patients were classified by the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) [38, 39] with scores of 2 and 3, as determined by the procedure described above.\n\ns_00318: 53, 61 The MrOS study is a multicenter study enrolling around 6000 men older than 65 y in order to identify risk factors for fractures in older men ( Table 2) .\n\ns_00368: For this reason, we are not reporting P runoff reduction for field operations because the modeled scenarios based on the data currently available, which are for Maryland, are not likely to be representative of the country.\n\ns_00418: Improved statistical power with full dynamic scanning likely is attributable to greater consistency in the selection of the time window used for quantification.\n\ns_00468: More appropriate conclusions can be made based on models with better fit.\n\ns_00518: However, because of spatial variation in temperature regimes (i.e., warmer in the south, as shown in Figure 3 ), there were likely many individual grid cells in which future temperatures overlapped the historic range even if the study area yearly means do not.\n\ns_00568: In his January 2016 State of the Union address, President Obama announced a new initiative in cancer, a Cancer Moonshot that has such goals as accelerating progress by focusing on preventive vaccines, early detection, immunotherapy, pediatric cancer, and data sharing (Lowy and Collins, 2016) .\n\ns_00618: In light of the rapidly expanding knowledge and realization that care cannot be paused indefinitely, fertility clinics around the world are beginning to resume treatment.\n\ns_00660: [2012b] Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\ns_00710: The Table 4 reports estimates of increased corn and same is true of soybean production: only 102 counsoybean revenues for three hypothetical standards, ties (16 percent) have both soybean production and a summer cumulative exposure index (CEI) of ozone exposures above 15.0 ppm-h.\n\ns_00760: In the next section, we review the literature on early science achievement gaps and point to the need for the current study.\n\ns_00810: Field notes were used to keep track of observations, encounters and decisions made during the study.\n\ns_00860: White and Thurow (1985) recommended creating a disturbance-free buffer zone of 0.25 km around nest sites, whereas Olendorff (1993) suggested buffer zones of 0.25 km for brief disturbances, 0.5 km for intermittent activities, 0.8 km for prolonged activities, and at least 1 km for construction or similar activities.\n\ns_00910: Most existing studies have been focusing on binary classification problems, e.g., distinguishing AD patients from normal control (NC) elderly or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals from NC elderly.\n\ns_00960: As proposed in the cited works, the net long-term warming of the water column due to the action of the intense winds in the tropical regions can affect ocean heat transport and impact processes that depend on ocean heat content.\n\ns_01010: A part of the future work will therefore be the adaptation of the model such that it can also be used for upper stage tanks.\n\ns_01060: Both data sets include weights to expand the sample households in the data to represent all farm and nonfarm households in the U.S.\n\ns_01110: We also adjusted for a theoretically relevant set of child-, household-, teacher-, and classroomlevel variables.\n\ns_01160: 14 a Storm surge and inundation produced by a Hurricane Rita, b hypothetical Hurricane Rita that did not undergo ocean-induced intensification in which the maximum wind speeds have been reduced by 20 %, c storm surge and inundation difference between Hurricane Rita and the hypothetical Hurricane Rita without intensification and d percentage difference between the surge with and without intensification with respect to the original, observed Hurricane Rita 2005) to fit all the data contained in the Global Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) datasets (Jim Cummings 2011, personal communication).\n\ns_01210: Our analysis has several notable strengths, including the large sample size and the inclusion of a diverse sample of clinical trials across multiple sites.\n\ns_01260: The framework includes measuring information and data literacy, which it refers to as the ability to find data, information and digital content and evaluate and manage such content (Vuorikari et al.\n\ns_01310: It is the goal of this paper to systematically review the epidemiologic evidence for potential patterns of heterogeneity in both the symptom syndromes and in the trajectories of common mood and anxiety disorders.\n\ns_01360: 43, 53 Finally, each lab tends to use its own pre-processing techniques and machine learning analytical approaches, adding further complexity/heterogeneity when comparing results from different studies.\n\ns_01410: Therefore, we examine the relationship of JES SSTA variability to the environmental variables representing these phenomena.\n\ns_01460: The study focused on the NIH, which accounts for 99 percent of the research spending in the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as on the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture."
