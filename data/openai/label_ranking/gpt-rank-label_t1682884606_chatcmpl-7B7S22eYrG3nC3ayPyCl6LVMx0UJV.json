The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08921: From this he deduced that the power coefficient (z-value) of the SPAR should be about 0.26.\n\ns_08971: [1979] state that 55 to 140 and 140 to 220 melting degree days (MDD) are required to observe opening and movements of nearshore landfast ice and complete clearance of landfast ice off coast, respectively.\n\ns_09021: These findings provide an empirical understanding of the associated multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding, and they enable more informed decisions moving forward regarding a policy with potential health implications for Oregon students.\n\ns_09071: Determining the TC's center position was the only reliably produced operational use of TC satellite analysis until the influential work of Dvorak [22] in 1972.\n\ns_09121: The structural and functional information extracted from two imaging modalities results in a feature space with much higher dimension than the population size.\n\ns_09171: BPS:12/17 student-level data are compiled from student surveys and matches to governmental and administrative databases.\n\ns_09221: Estimates of differences in yield, revenue, pesticide cost, and pesticide use, and estimates of net returns to transgenic crops were taken directly or, in some cases, imputed from the reported information.\n\ns_09271: Each age group was stratified by median gait speed (1.14 m/s, faster/slower): group 1 (102/40 participants), group 2 (96/51 participants), group 3 (67/90 participants), group 4 (37/128 participants), and a two group t test was used to formally test for differences in the log of cumulative daily activity counts by gait speed.\n\ns_09321: The field that deals with these issues is denoted as \"Computational Anatomy\" (CA), a term introduced by Grenander and Miller in 1998 [1] .\n\ns_09371: We also conducted experiments on the pure 1.5 T dataset that yielded very similar results to those obtained from the combined 1.5 T/3 T dataset, and are thus not reported.\n\ns_09421: However, there was a borderline interaction between BMD and age (p=0.07) and analyses stratified by median age suggested a stronger relationship between BMD and AC in participants older than 68 years old (OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.60-0.97, p=0.03) as compared to the younger ones (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.62-1.07, p=0.15).\n\ns_09471: The whole genome sequence was submitted to GenBank (ID:MT327745.1) and GISAID (ID: EPI_ISL_424366) and the raw data deposited on SRA (SAMN15062833).\n\ns_09521: Literature has reported very high expression of ACE2 receptor in GIT, particularly in small and large intestines [75, 76] .\n\ns_09571: We also found a very small but statistically significant increase in the age 50 to 60 period (d \u03ed .06, p \u03fd .05), although the latter effect demonstrated publication bias and should be interpreted cautiously.\n\ns_09621: Appendix Table A Notes: Means are weighted by sampling weights that adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.\n\ns_09671: A number of research has been focused on accurate estimation of cortical thickness (as reviewed in [2] ).\n\ns_09721: We analyzed students in the United States for years 1988 through 2000 and controlled for differences in academic achievement, academic characteristics, and students' and parents' demographics.\n\ns_09771: In the deep learning model, with a relatively small number of training samples, the DBN, which was stacked with RBMs, has certain advantages.\n\ns_09821: In addition, the collected data was analyzed qualitatively.\n\ns_09871: Handling Irregularly Sampled Data.\n\ns_09921: This is consistent with our intention to examine how emigration-prospective, present, and past-affects the existing population at a particular point in time.\n\ns_09971: For the lowest salary per school district as presented in Table 4 the impact of the number of low-income students has diminished considerably to the effect of not being statistically significant.\n\ns_00023: The search feature allows a researcher who does not have access to NDAR (or to some of the federated repositories) to see if there is enough data to warrant applying for access.\n\ns_00073: Table 4 displays the results of the series of nested logistic regression models with each model including an additional covariate, allowing us to examine how the inclusion of each successive covariate influenced the overall model fit and other parameter estimates.\n\ns_00123: These response rates are comparable with the overall sample's (see above)."
