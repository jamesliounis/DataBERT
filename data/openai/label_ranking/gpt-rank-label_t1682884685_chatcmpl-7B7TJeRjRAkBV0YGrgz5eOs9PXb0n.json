The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07596: Table 11 presents a recalculation of EIGVIO and of annual percentage changes in GVIO/E for 1980/85 based on published branch data for E and on information from other sources giving branch time series of GVIO.\n\ns_07646: The level of creditor participation will in turn substantially depend on what sort of menu of debt exchange instruments a debtor can offer in order to retire existing claims.\n\ns_07696: Tables 3 and 4 provide information to assess the benefits from investments in transport infrastructure as represented by a decrease in the cost per ton-mile, a.\n\ns_07746: We find public investment, corporate tax revenues, and the liquidity constraint variable to be statistically significant.\n\ns_07796: Although the PLSS is an unusually clean data set, where much effort was devoted to correcting anomalies, it is still open to a variety of impurities due to, inter alia, measurement errors, data entry, and inaccurate reporting by respondents and enumerators.\n\ns_07846: A detailed list including \"packages\" is included in the PIP that has been submitted to IDA before Board presentation.\n\ns_07896: To take both of these factors into account the model must be revised accordingly.\n\ns_07946: None of the surveys carried out as part of this research could be conducted in accordance with rigorous social science research protocols in the sense that it was not possible to construct welldefined sample frames from which to select the respondents.\n\ns_07996: 7 The latter figure reflects the high concentration of individual deposits as well as the exclusion of all corporate deposits.\n\ns_08046: Also, we want to be able to examine the trade offs between the two main sources of heating energy used during the winter months in Montenegro, which are electricity and fuelwood.\n\ns_08096: 23 One important implication of this literature is that evaluation of alternative fiscal strategies has to take into account their respective growth consequences, not just to gauge the economy's future aggregate performance, but also to assess the full effects of the different fiscal policy paths on public finances themselves.\n\ns_08146: One of the best examples of social tables is offered by Gregory King's famous estimates for England and Wales in 1688 (Barnett 1936; Lindert and Williamson 1982 ).\n\ns_08196: This measure serves in the model as a proxy for students' initial wealth.\n\ns_08246: Departments across the country yearn for clear direction on how to incorporate active learning into their courses at all levels.\n\ns_08273: 13 A designated sample of predetermined institutions, ranging from 2 to 4-year institutions of higher education (IHEs), is used to collect PEQIS data.\n\ns_08323: The spreadsheet data is created from the coding script, available on the online repository (\"script.do\").\n\ns_08373: In addition the GPS were applied to large samples with individual level genotype and phenotype data (For AD cases-control: 2813 AD cases, and 6438 controls (of which 4926 are unscreened for AD, aged 54), and \u22658751 for iron measures).\n\ns_08423: Then, voxel intensities from each ROI are used as features (Zhang et al., 2011; Mikhno et al., 2012) .\n\ns_08473: The 1%-2% of the population that is homozygous for the APOE 34 allele represents another at-risk or preclinical sample Neuron 69, January 27, 2011 \u00aa2011 Elsevier Inc. 207 Neuron Perspective for clinical trials (Reiman et al., 2010) , and being a homozygote increases risk for AD by 15 times compared to APOE 33 or 32 carriers (Farrer et al., 1997; Reiman et al., 2010) .\n\ns_08523: In the WIC 2015 dataset, findings from an earlier collection and harmonization effort (Bauer et al.\n\ns_08573: While SVM 10 and SVM 25 identified a few relevant markers similar to EN50, they also yielded some questionable blue blocks and the selected features varied a lot among di3erent cross-validation trials.\n\ns_08623: 24,34,55 We can speculate that the greater amounts of dispensed buprenorphine are likely associated with the treatment of more individuals for longer periods and that those physicians who have sought a waiver to treat up to 100 patients are likely treating more individuals than are physicians waivered to treat 30 patients.\n\ns_08673: It was observed that students' performance in the two subjects were high in countries that were encouraging the use of the technology.\n\ns_08723: Three statistical parameters are shown: the CF of water level amplitude errors, the RMSE of water level amplitudes, and the CF of the error in the amplitude of high water and low water events.\n\ns_08773: \"Ever participated in health research\" and \"Opportunity to participate in health research\" are dichotomous outcomes, thus a multivariable logistic regression was used."
