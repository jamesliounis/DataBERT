The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08680: The curriculum framework used for TIMSS-2003 has two organizing dimensions or aspects, a content dimension and a cognitive dimension, similar to those used in TIMSS-1995 and1999.\n\ns_08730: The values of R are required for both the modelled and observed time series.\n\ns_08780: Therefore, important insights may be gained via oversampling of rural, minority, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in future population-based surveys.\n\ns_08830: For both hyperparameters the similarity is high between two consecutive values (>0.90), as can be seen in Table 3 .\n\ns_08880: This macro/ micro split was exemplified by Anna, a young White British woman with a degree in psychology who was studying part time (for an MA in creative writing).\n\ns_08930: We have already seen that a commonly appropriate null hypothesis is the POLO.\n\ns_08980: [49] Our observations can be placed in historical context on the basis of observations of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office [1958].\n\ns_09030: There are important, practical implications of our findings.\n\ns_09080: The role of satellite observations in NWP forecast skills is normally assessed by the observing system experiments (OSEs) in which denying or adding a set of satellite data is applied from or to a baseline observing system in order to show its impacts on the forecast skills [96] [97] [98] .\n\ns_09130: While there are several ways to look at this problem, we present here a formulation of the classifier supervised by the AD group and healthy control group (NL).\n\ns_09180: As mentioned by Tourangeau and Yan (2007), few studies have examined the validity of data reported using forgiving wording, and results from those have been mixed, showing no difference or small increases in response to sensitive questions (Abelson, Loftus, and Greenwald 1992;Catania et al.\n\ns_09230: Based on Fulton and Keyowski, they assumed that adoption of GM canola decreased marginal costs at the farm level by 8.5%.\n\ns_09280: As demonstrated in the stratified subgroup analysis, the positive effect of employment was strongest in the youngest age group.\n\ns_09330: We find that the Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and hippocampus and Ventricle Region size are the most useful.\n\ns_09380: Such priors were computed using the DARTEL tool of SPM8 (Ashburner and Friston, 2009 ) from a dataset of 136 MR scans of healthy subjects (41 \u00b1 25 years) acquired at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, in the same conditions as the template image.\n\ns_09430: As shown in Figure 2 , both normal (OR: 1.76; 95%CI 1.24-2.50, p=0.0015) and obese (OR: 1.23; 95%CI 0.84-1.80, p=0.295) participants had higher AC severity than the intermediate overweight group.\n\ns_09480: The hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait.\n\ns_09530: In India, first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020, which originated from China.\n\ns_09580: In the present study, we have assembled the largest metaanalytic database of longitudinal studies of mean-level personality change in existence in order to address the question of how personality traits change across the life course.\n\ns_09630: In analyses of both datasets, we combine households earning less than $20,000 in one ''low-income household'' category, which is in line with the U.S. census poverty line for a family of four during this time.\n\ns_09680: [5] investigated the potential of fully automated measurements of cortical thickness to reproduce the clinical diagnosis in 19 AD and 17 cognitive unimpaired (CU) subjects.\n\ns_09730: There is an additional comparison across these pairs that should not go unnoted.\n\ns_09780: First, a DBN stacked by 3 RBMs was used for feature dimension reduction and recoding like an autoencoder.\n\ns_09830: In the current study, the results showed an increased number of problem solving strategies being implemented to solve problem 2 in phase 3, such as \"use logical reasoning,\" \"guess and check,\" \"organize data in a table or a list,\" \"look for a pattern,\" \"solve an equation,\" and \"use arithmetic operations. \"\n\ns_09880: While we focus on both the continuous valued and time-to-event predictions for tests in Section 4, we include descriptions of binary predictions here for completeness."
