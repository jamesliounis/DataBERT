The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09901: In this vein, we are currently using data on the location of patenting inventors and the location of patent citations to investigate the extent of knowledge flows to inventors' formers homes (see, for example, Agrawal et.\n\ns_09951: At this juncture we exam the finding and start with the results indicated in Table 1 .\n\ns_00003: Before requesting access, a researcher can see the data dictionaries that were used to deposit the data, the number of observations, and the number of unique subjects.\n\ns_00053: A characteristic of this data set is that it is an aggregation of a series of data sets collected over a span of 6 years from [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] for the PMQ, with follow-up data for MD/PhD program enrollment updated through 2012.\n\ns_00103: Future research, using data that have a stronger set of background measures from before men became fathers, needs to work to disentangle the complicated causal relationships among teenage fatherhood, social disadvantage, and marriage.\n\ns_00153: While the statistics for the stroke dataset shown in Table 1 were computed over the ventricle structures, the statistics for the simulated ADNI dataset were computed over 30 different anatomical structures as defined in the FreeSurfer protocol.\n\ns_00203: The data were taken from the public domain, which may not be accurate or confirmed by nations' public health units.\n\ns_00250: Based on the ADNI study, Gibbons et al.\n\ns_00300: This issue is important when data coming from research studies like these are transposed and applied to daily clinical practice since IAs are commonly employed, at present, in clinical laboratories.\n\ns_00350: \u2022 December 2013 23(6) Table 6 .\n\ns_00400: PVC and adoption of white matter as reference led to a considerably smaller estimated sample size needed to achieve an 80% power and two-sided type-I error of p = 0.05 to detect a reduced rate of amyloid accumulation in hypothetical anti-amyloid therapy trials.\n\ns_00450: The DINA model has been used in analyses of the TIMSS data by several authors, including Lee et al., (2011) and Choi, Lee, and Park (2015) .\n\ns_00500: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096747.g005 considered acceptable, between 0.8 and 0.9 good, and greater than 0.9 outstanding [35] .\n\ns_00550: They include genomic technologies and computational tools, which resulted in large part from the Human Genome Project; stem-cell technologies; genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9; and, of particular importance to neuroscience, rapidly advancing technologies to study and even control activity in the cells and circuits of living brains and to provide useful maps of connectivity, such as those emerging from the Human Connectome Project and from the Allen Institute for Brain Science.\n\ns_00600: The small sample size used for the age-related analysis should also be taken into account.\n\ns_00642: The Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 regional distribution and annual variation of the CI reduction (Figure 8d) largely reflects the changes in TCHP and 100 m mean temperature.\n\ns_00692: For this analysis, county-level ductions in crop exposure to ozone vary widely in yield and acreage data were taken from the 1992 their representations of producer and consumer re-Census of Agriculture, while price data comes sponses to changes in air quality (see ; from Agricultural Statistics 4 .\n\ns_00742: The present study fills this void by utilizing data from the newest iteration of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, making use of the newly added science assessments in the earliest grades.\n\ns_00792: In the coding process, the raw data were read, and units of meaning were identified and labelled.\n\ns_00842: ), followed by ground squirrels and pocket gophers Olendorff, 1993; Ng and others, 2017) .\n\ns_00892: We evaluated the proposed method and compared it with state-of-the-art alternative methods based on the same training and validation datasets.\n\ns_00942: The wind dataset extends from July 1987 to July 2015, the sea surface temperature dataset from 1981 to November 2016, the sea surface height dataset from January 1993 to December 2016.\n\ns_00992: The paper will also describe the results of a test case compared to the EADS Astrium tool EUCES.\n\ns_01042: This paper compares the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey and the 2001 Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances.\n\ns_01092: Before doing so, however, we looked at the patterns of missing data and found that there were 151 missing data patterns for the 4-year-old cohort and 212 missing data patterns for the 3-year-old cohort, suggesting that data were not systematically missing (see also Chien & Mistry, 2013) ."
