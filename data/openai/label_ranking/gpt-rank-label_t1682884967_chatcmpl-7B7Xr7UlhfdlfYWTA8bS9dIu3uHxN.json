The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_04904: In addition, spatial autocorrelation is also found to matter to the firm location choice.\n\ns_04954: Traditionally, most of this was publicly funded: in the eighties for example, public investment in infrastructure was estimated at 4.3% of GDP in middle income countries (Easterly and Rebelo, 1993) .\n\ns_05004: Specifically, column (3) of Table 2 shows that the elasticity of manufacturing exports to the REER does not change with GVC position in the first panel with annual data but it is more negative the higher the position in GVCs in the case of the fiveyear averages in the second panel.\n\ns_05054: Our variable of interest is whether the firm used the services of an EPA between 2006 and 2010.\n\ns_05104: This index is defined based on factor analysis (Filmer & Pritchett, 2001 ) using indicator variables to determine whether or not the household owns certain goods such as a car, a refrigerator, or a television, and facilitates the classification of households into quintiles, from the poorest to the richest.\n\ns_05154: This point is illustrated in the graph below which shows the average GDP per capita growth rate during 2011 -2015 against the average investment share during the same period for more than 200 countries for which data is available from the World Development Indicators database.\n\ns_05204: Regressions control for baseline measures of household size, household size squared, the inverse hyperbolic sine of household income, parent's years of education, age of child, age of child squared, gender, whether the child was sick in the past year, the number of times sick, total number of health visits, and survey round and market fixed effects.\n\ns_05254: Moreover, initiatives such as the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) promoted by the World Bank, the OECD Water Governance Indicators or the more commerciallyoriented platforms, such as the Global Water Intelligence (GWI) or the International Water Association (IWA), all produce useful partial data sets allowing some degree of benchmarking.\n\ns_05304: EXTRAi = CCOST1*RURi + CCOST2*INDi + CCOST3*POORi 6.\n\ns_05354: T-statistics are in parenthesis.\n\ns_05404: Hence, the iterative process is a Monte-Carlo Markov -Chain (MCMC) in the parameter space with convergence to the stationary distribution that averages over the missing data.\n\ns_05454: Table 9 shows that most of the empirical regularities established in previous studies hold in our broad cross-country data.\n\ns_05504: First, the surveys designed for this study attempted to collect data on both the legal/procedural requirements, and the practical side of citizen interaction with governments and services providers.\n\ns_05554: Section 3 describes the data, while Section 4 presents the methodology and the estimated trends in the skill content of jobs.\n\ns_05604: In some cases, we do not have population data for counties therefore our user sample of WWTPs is reduced to 891.\n\ns_05654: , 1989) , una parte del menor resultado observado en las pruebas de los proveedores, con relaci\u00f3n al de los j\u00f3venes, se explica por la edad de los proveedores.\n\ns_05704: The frequency distribution of SUs which generate the transactions is not as skewed as that of the transactions.\n\ns_05754: For men, a rise in the technology measure is associated with a rise in the unemployment rate (columns 2 and 3 in Table 14) .\n\ns_05804: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 OLS regression.\n\ns_05854: We focus on the comparative significance of the satellite-based estimates as indicators of ground-level PM2.5.\n\ns_05904: * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.\n\ns_05954: Based on the findings of Hayakawa and Ito (2015) and the theoretical model of Feenstra (1989) , incomplete pass-through means that an increase in T or ER induces the firm to decrease \u03c0 to reduce the impact of the shock on consumers prices.\n\ns_06004: To evaluate the validity of model (1), a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test is conducted after the estimation.\n\ns_06054: In particular, the quantitative STMs would have been 0.83 for the developed countries and 1.42 for the Latin American economies.3 3 The long-run multiplier is de\u2026ned as the discounted sum of changes in output divided by the discounted sum of changes in social transfers.\n\ns_06104: In addition, activity-specific databases have been consulted, including airwars.org and Arms Control Organization timeline of confirmed chemical weapon use in Syria."
