The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01479: o Include in the application form key personal characteristics for each investigator, including gender, race and ethnicity, institution (in a way that can be easily categorized), type of academic appointment for investigators in postsecondary education, discipline, degree, and year of degree.\n\ns_01529: As such, the CSSP, which is most relevant to the coupling with GOSSYM in the present study, has outperformed major land surface models in predicting soil temperature and moisture distributions, terrestrial hydrology variations, and land-atmosphere exchanges (Yuan and Liang, 2011a) .\n\ns_01579: Figure 9 further depicts the time histories of water elevations at the seven monitoring stations, of which locations are shown in Figure 9 (a).\n\ns_01629: Nasopharyngeal swabs samples from patients with clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 across the country were received at the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS, National Institute of Health) as part of the virological surveillance of COVID-19.\n\ns_01679: It is clear from the discussion of published methods above that far more methods have been developed than just the selection listed in Table 2 that are available for installing locally.\n\ns_01729: 20 The 9-level scale codes gradations of metropolitan areas (ie, population $20,000) (codes 1-3) and nonmetropolitan areas (ie, population \\20,000) (4-9 or Alaska and Hawaii), 21 thus allowing for the extraction of a dichotomous metro versus nonmetro variable.\n\ns_01779: If the r-th group only has complete observations, then G(r) = {r}, M r = 1 and\nNote that the total number of equations exceeds the number of coefficient parameters, and estimating functions from groups with fewer missing variables or more accurate imputations tend to have smaller variance.\n\ns_01829: We would like to emphasize that these eigenvectors were already included in the spatial filtering models so it is not necessary to include new independent variables into the models, which is the advantage of applying the spatial filtering in empirical research [72] .\n\ns_01879: Comparisons were made in this report only when p<.05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family.\n\ns_01929: Tissue and DNA samples stored in biobanks [20-22,e5] have enabled these discoveries.\n\ns_01979: Furthermore, it is also important to note that small differences in the numbers of deaths recorded are present depending on where and when the data were sourced.\n\ns_02029: This study addresses this drawing on data on attainment at age 11 and 16 relating to 608 students, 115 of whom played a musical instrument.\n\ns_02079: 77 In brief, CRISPR-Cas-based detection methods are still in their introductory phase and need to be further optimized.\n\ns_02129: Specifically, the intestinal type accounted for 64.3 % of gastric cancers in Central America (n=4200/6530) but only 30.5 % among US Hispanics (n=1001/3285) [19] .\n\ns_02179: Co-Citation establishes an intellectual relationship with earlier literature in a field/subfield/area of research; strength of relationship based on frequency of co-citation pairs.\n\ns_02262: However, to avoid potential end point effects that high WMH values could have on regression estimates, WMHs were restricted to less than 2% of total brain volume, where approximately 8% of observations had WMHs of 2% or greater.\n\ns_02312: Similarly the c. 1609 land cover is of necessity somewhat speculative, though here we can use known ecological relationships to help reinforce our interpretation of the pre-development ecology [Sanderson, 2009;Sanderson and Brown, 2007].\n\ns_02362: (22) found that HOMA-IR is stable across at least 4 years in overweight, late middleaged humans; therefore, our index of HOMA-IR very likely reflects IR at the time of the scan.\n\ns_02412: Journal 615 of Climate, 16, 571-591.\n\ns_02462: The sample distribution was skewed to the right, indicating the presence of a small number of PCPs with \"relatively extreme\" LVC spending.\n\ns_02512: By pooling SARS-CoV-2 samples across specific geographic regions and time points for analysis, we find evidence for positive selection in all populations but with varying evolutionary fitnesses (fitness ranging from 1.05 to 1.5) in Asia, Europe, and North America from March to July 2020 ( Figure 2a ).\n\ns_02562: Quantile regression for count data examines how quantiles of the conditional distribution of a response variable recorded in discrete units (number of visits) depend on a set of explanatory variables.\n\ns_02612: Public Health 2015, 12\nbetween MetS in patients with BPH and concentration glucose, ChT, LDL, HDL, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.\n\ns_02662: Other trials using mifepristone that were initiated were terminated without being published, indicating that these trials were not completed, or yielded negative results (O'Banion, 2013) .\n\ns_02712: Still, by examining average admissions probabilities among groups defined by important determinants, like SAT scores, it is possible to get an idea of the roles of race and academic qualifications in admissions."
