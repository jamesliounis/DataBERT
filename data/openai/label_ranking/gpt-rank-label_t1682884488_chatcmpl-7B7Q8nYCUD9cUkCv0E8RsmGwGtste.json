The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01559: This numerical software has been extensively verified and validated since it was developed in the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering at the University of Mississippi (e.g.\n\ns_01609: The number of international flights and number of passengers arriving to Colombia from January 1 to March 9, 2020 were obtained from the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics of Colombia (Aerocivil, aerocivil.gov.co).\n\ns_01659: Therefore, it seems imperative that to make real progress, training data should be made available that captures the variability that is encountered in a real clinical or trial setting, not only the variability due to inter-patient differences, but also that due to the heterogeneity of scanners and imaging protocols.\n\ns_01709: The divisions introduced (ie, local, regional, and distant) are consistent with SEER classifications and, perhaps most importantly, are correlated with DSS in both univariate and multivariable models.\n\ns_01759: , S. Figure 1 illustrates a setting with three sources.\n\ns_01809: That is, once spatial structure is taking into account, the relevance of social capital and income inequality to mortality is reduced; as such, our findings contribute to the ongoing debates on these topics [60, 77] .\n\ns_01859: Three types of statistical procedures were employed in this report: testing differences between means (or proportions), testing for linear trends, and adjustment of means after controlling for covariation among several variables.\n\ns_01909: When a matching patient is found in the clinical databases, all the matching data fields are imported from the clinical database to the Progeny database.\n\ns_01959: WHO) and were reviewed by several academics before being included in the study.\n\ns_02009: The multiple R was .4 with an adjusted R 2 of .157 (F(3,603) = 38.59, p < .0001).\n\ns_02059: A clinical trial showed that the mortality rate of severe patients (28%) was lower with treatment with dexamethasone compared to those that received conventional treatment (41%).\n\ns_02109: Lastly, regarding the US SEER data, studies have shown that identification algorithms can misidentify Hispanic groups, especially US born Hispanics [29] .\n\ns_02159: Scientometrics applies various mathematical and statistical techniques to capture insights of research activity from research papers and patents and other published sources including online sources (Altmetrics) by constructing various types of indicators.\n\ns_02209: Participants were at least 60, initially free of cognitive impairment, dementia, and dismobility (gait speed\u22640.6m/s), with repeated measures of verbal memory and gait speed before dementia diagnosis (average follow-up 5.8-12.1 years).\n\ns_02242: Other covariates, including age, sex, and educational status, were used to describe the study sample.\n\ns_02292: Results from the aforementioned flood hazard study for NY Harbor are used as offshore boundary data for our Jamaica Bay model grid.\n\ns_02342: Importantly, the HOMA-IR and FDG-PET association for MCI-P remained similar after removing one log HOMA-IR value (0.87) three SDs from the group mean (R 2 = 0.307, P = 0.008), or that value and another case that was two SDs from the group mean (R 2 = 0.148, P = 0.048).\n\ns_02392: 572 provided by NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory, sponsored by the\n\ns_02442: We added interaction terms in our regression models to explore whether the observed differential in LVC spending by rurality in our findings was due to differences in the composition of PCP specialty between rural and urban areas.\n\ns_02492: Both the continental and the COG UK data profiling is an excellent example of how the simulationbased CNN/RNN tools can track selective differences among viral clones almost in real time.\n\ns_02542: Natural logs of the continuous variables were used as indicated in the model specification in Table 2 .\n\ns_02592: n-the size of the group; min-max-min, max; Q1-Q3-the first and third quartile; me (Q)-median (quartile deviation); X \u0305 \u00b1 SD-arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\n\ns_02642: On the one hand, several studies highlighted associations between stressful events and poorer subsequent cognitive performance, in particular in memory and executive functions (Xavier et al., 2002; VonDras et al., 2005; van Gelder et al., 2006; Lupien et al., 2007) above and beyond the impact of depression (Comijs et al., 2011) .\n\ns_02692: The last two rows of the table present estimates of the representation of black students relative to white students under the alternative counterfactual of school integration (or of equalization in school quality).\n\ns_02742: This resulted in the identification of 17 common land cover classes representing open lands, agricultural lands, forest lands, and developed areas (Table 1)."
