The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06308: In the first column, we see that compared to the control villages, the effect of the treatment seems to be increasing for each successive group.\n\ns_06358: Similarly, summary statistics of alternative estimates of intergenerational mobility that consider secondary education at the province and district levels can be found in the Appendix (see Table A8 , A9, A11, and A12).\n\ns_06408: The lower panel of Table 3 contains the estimates for the son's and daughter's samples.\n\ns_06458: The results in Table 1 suggest that the pandemic led to a modest, 1.7% increase in (monthly) electricity consumption in Rwanda (column 2).\n\ns_06508: For the purpose of the estimation, we employed the Scikit-Learn 1.1.1 library in Python 3.10.5, and used the function DecisionTreeClassifier.\n\ns_06558: In high-and upper-middle-income countries, the decline was not as pronounced probably due to a more extensive use of virtual tools to replace inperson marketing activities.\n\ns_06608: Finally, the framework developed in the paper provides some estimates, based on cross-country relationships, of the productivity improvements and growth consequences that could be expected from greater outward orientation.\n\ns_06658: The Scandinavian experience can shed light on the transitional issues as the agencies concerned have now had time to \"settle\" in the wake of the merger.\n\ns_06708: As we indicated in the opening of the paper, since Turkey opened up its economy through a series of reforms in the 1 980s, establishing fiscal discipline has been a key policy challenge.\n\ns_06758: One of the key findings was that 'microcredit has a positive and significant effect on poverty status of the program households\u2026.'\n\ns_06808: where m k are total home imports of good k, x i k are exports of good k by country i, which is lobbying for preferences.\n\ns_06858: Thus, the context is determined by a wide array of policies and public investments, and the overall efficiency, equity, and transparency of their design and execution.\n\ns_06908: The Table 1 also gives the impacts expressed as a percentage of the annual rates of poverty reduction from 1990 to 2001.\n\ns_06958: It is also robust to a number of identification problems common to estimating the impact of school inputs on learning, which we discuss below.\n\ns_07008: There is also a growing body of analytic work showing that neighborhood attributes may affect economic and social outcomes through the behaviors, attitudes or characteristics of others who live within the same area.\n\ns_07058: the numbers indicate a strong reduction of the average level during the Convertibility years from 1991until 2002.\n\ns_07108: In Fan, Zhang, and Zhang (2000) , for instance, a provincial production function relates agricultural GDP per capita to land per worker, agricultural capital per worker, agroclimate, and infrastructure stock.\n\ns_07158: For example, Ammer et al.\n\ns_07208: where T i is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a household received BDH transfers.\n\ns_07258: The numbers in parentheses following each of the EBRD columns are the rankings based on the average and most recent EBRD scores, respectively.\n\ns_07308: Based on the authors' calculation from A Survey of Chinese SOEs: 1980-89.\n\ns_07358: In this section we will review those treatments.\n\ns_07408: Maxwell and Fernando (1989, p.1689 ) summarize well the position of the protagonists (see references in that paper): (a) the introduction of new export crops and generally unsuitable practices lead to soil erosion, desertification, water pollution and salination; (b) \"cash cropping adds to the value of land and leads to land mining or the incorporation of previously uncultivated land, which is often unsuited to cash cropping\";\n\ns_07458: Within this context we analyze next how the mix of grants and ODA debt forgiveness is allocated across these countries; that is, we study whether there is a clear criteria or rationale for such allocation.\n\ns_07508: Their average annual levels are summarized in F.) which is the average of the system for 1990."
