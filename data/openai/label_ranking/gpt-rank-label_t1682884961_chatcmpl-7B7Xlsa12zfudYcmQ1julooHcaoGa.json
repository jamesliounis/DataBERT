The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01171: Thus, the ocean's cooling and resulting negative TC intensity feedback was reduced and there was 300 % more energy available from air-sea sensible and latent heat fluxes to fuel Nargis' sudden intensification (Lin et al.\n\ns_01221: Findings: Baseline MMSE category was associated with baseline scores and rate of decline on the ADAS-Cog, adjusting for age and education (both P , .001).\n\ns_01271: As a component of problem solving, the survey considers the adults ability to access, process, evaluate and analyse information.\n\ns_01321: Facilitated by methods such as latent class analysis, a growing body of epidemiologic research has attempted to disentangle phenotypic heterogeneity of common mood and anxiety disorders by identifying clusters of symptoms.\n\ns_01371: A further methodological challenge for multicenter studies is to ensure reliability of nonimaging data collection across multiple sites.\n\ns_01421: Figure 11 shows temporal variation of the second mode SSTA T 2 (x, y, t) from mid-1987 to mid-1993.\n\ns_01471: We found the same result when we looked at surveys of scientists, social scientists, and engineers.\n\ns_01521: Th e redeveloped GOSSYM has a peak frequency of 40% at the relative mean bias of -0.05, while the peak frequency of the original model is 7.5% at the relative mean bias of 1.05.\n\ns_01571: Meanwhile, only two empirical parameters were calibrated: an empirical parameter of sediment transport rate (B w ) in the Watanabe's total load formulation, and the coefficient of downslope gravitational effect (\u03b5) in the morphological change equation (see the definition in Ding et al., 2006b) .\n\ns_01621: This approach which relies on phylogenetic analysis has allowed researchers across the world to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 emergence in humans, to track its geographical spread and to investigate its evolutionary dynamics (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .\n\ns_01671: Both this difference between SIENA-R and longitudinal VBM, and the superiority of (within-subject) registration-based techniques may be explained by the design of the methods: analysis methods that analyze within-subject change over time directly, by concurrently analyzing multiple timepoints, make use of the fact that intra-subject variability is generally smaller than inter-subject variability.\n\ns_01721: Though there is a risk of misattribution, this is largely mitigated by the coding scheme for this variable which accounts for tumor sequence, site of original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities.\n\ns_01771: The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves higher model selection accuracy than other competing methods through fully utilizing information from incomplete samples.\n\ns_01821: In order to tie the spatial filtering procedures above to the OLS regression, one needs to incorporate a set of independent variables (X) into Eq (1) as follows:\nwhere X is a matrix containing the independent variables, which is the same X included in the basic OLS regression.\n\ns_01871: The BPS:90/94 sample member's postsecondary outcome variables were then attached to NELS:88/94 sample member #1's record.\n\ns_01921: Some of these studies have defined brain deposits that characterized new subgroups of FTLD defined by TDP-43 [3] or fused in sarcoma protein pathologies [2] .\n\ns_01971: 2020; Gardner and Moallef 2015; Tsang et al.\n\ns_02021: Correlation studies have explored the relationships between active music making and enhanced executive functioning with largely positive results although there are some exceptions (see Hallam, 2015 for a review).\n\ns_02071: developed a cheap, highthroughput SARS-CoV-2 detection method based on RT-PCR to analyze 10 000 samples in 1 operation at a price of $1 per sample.\n\ns_02121: Cancers of the antrum were more common in Central America (73.6 %, n=4495/6105), whereas cancers of the corpus were slightly more common among US Hispanics (53.9 %, n= 2383/4413).\n\ns_02171: Examining from the Dimensions database as of 22 April, it was found that 1633 clinical trials are being conducted on the virus and 171 policy documents have been published so far.\n\ns_02221: Dual decline signifies a more rapid progression to dementia.\n\ns_02254: 8 Nevertheless, it is possible that the exclusion of these variables may have resulted in biased estimates from residual confounding.\n\ns_02304: At the request of our PAC (Project Advisory Committee), we evaluated the C-CAP data that is available, but found that urban classes of land cover that are dominant in our study area are not part of C-CAP.\n\ns_02354: This closed test procedure maintains a family-wise a = 0.05 by requiring unadjusted P values of 0.05 divided by x, x being the number of null hypotheses tested."
