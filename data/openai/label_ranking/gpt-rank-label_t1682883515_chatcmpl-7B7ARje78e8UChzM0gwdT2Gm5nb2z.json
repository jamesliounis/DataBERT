The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09656: [7] overcame the difficulties associated with both types of features by adopting the noise-filtered vertex-wise cortical thickness data based on spatial frequency analysis.\n\ns_09706: We used the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) for this study.\n\ns_09756: As shown in Table 4 , we achieved the best results in accuracy and sensitivity and achieved almost the best results in specificity.\n\ns_09806: These strategies fit the framework of the current study and can be used to describe problem-solving strategies demonstrated by the participants.\n\ns_09856: Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data are commonly used in longitudinal studies to forecast disease trajectories over time.\n\ns_09906: While aggregate data on return migration is unavailable, segment specific data such as NSF longitudinal data on PhD students suggests a number closer to 10 percent.\n\ns_09956: There are other results of this study that need to be addressed.\n\ns_00008: This information is being provided under the Data from Labs tab on the NDAR website as well as in the Autism Publications tab.\n\ns_00058: In this analysis, we examined data collected from and about a national cohort of students who had considered careers in medicine to address the following two questions:\n1.\n\ns_00108: See West (2007) for a discussion of the ECLS-B father surveys as compared with other data sources on fathers.\n\ns_00158: This is often done in population studies, where inter-subject registration is a core problem.\n\ns_00208: Therefore, this study aimed to explore the series of possible heterogeneities that could be found beneath the apparent similarity between two countries that appear to be matched when compared by indicators such as mortality.\n\ns_00255: A significant number of patients in all subgroups showed normal test results at followup, indicating that a neuropsychological diagnosis needs to be supported by imaging or biomarker data.\n\ns_00305: Recently, data coming from the EMAS study confirm that age is correlated with the development of primary hypogonadism, but not with secondary hypogonadism, the latter being strictly associated to comorbidities rather than age.\n\ns_00355: Total regional reduction in CO 2 emissions was calculated using\nwhere C is the annual reduction in megagrams of CO 2 emissions associated with the use of WSIN for operation type j in region k. C is equal to A, the average number of liters applied per hectare annually in operation type j in region k converted to hectare-meters, times D, the assumed percent reduction in water use associated with using WSIN, times E, the weighted sum of megagrams CO 2 emissions for all energy sources in region k, times B, the average number of hectares per operation of type j in region k, times O, the number of operations of type j in region k.\nThe potential magnitude of greenhouse gas emission reduction associated with the adoption of WSIN technology is illustrated in Table 2 .\n\ns_00405: Cross-sectional and longitudinal [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed.\n\ns_00455: This comparative study attempted to analyze TIMSS data sets for Korea and Turkey using a DINA model in order to present an application of a CDA-based analysis.\n\ns_00505: We used PRISM (PRISM, Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) data for historical climate records.\n\ns_00555: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has successfully used a combination of approaches whereby some biomedical research projects are supported as a result of unsolicited proposals and others are supported as a result of targeted requests for applications.\n\ns_00605: Gene expression data from 5 studies including 112 women with normal endometrial pathology was used to characterize receptor expression throughout the menstrual cycle.\n\ns_00647: The mean annual cycle of Amazon and Orinoco discharge ( Figure 1) is derived from the Global Runoff Data Center [(GRDC)/Federal Institute of Hydrology/ Germany, and International Hydrological Programme/ United Nations Educational/ Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2001], which provide monthly discharge measured at various stations along the rivers.\n\ns_00697: The procedure \"can be values for each day during a period, counts of all defined as a best linear unbiased estimator of a ozone readings over a certain threshold value, spatial variable at a particular site or geographic along with other variations.\n\ns_00747: Further details on the assessments can be found in the ECLS-K users' manual (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b).\n\ns_00797: When parts of a system are connected, synergy can be fostered (Duffy & Reigeluth, 2008) .\n\ns_00847: In a continent-wide survey, three Ferruginous Hawks were determined to have been killed by pesticide abuse (use of a pesticide outside of its approved application) (Mineau and others, 1999) ."
