The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08681: It also provided rich information on the context for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science in African schools which could be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in teaching and learning of these subjects.\n\ns_08731: For example, it is assumed that the specific hydrodynamic model used has been validated for momentum and mass conservation, that it has an established domain of applicability, and that the authors have sought users (not model developers) to set performance criteria.\n\ns_08781: The study relied on self-reported responses and, therefore, is subject to response bias.\n\ns_08831: A grid search was performed to choose the set of hyperparameters linked to the computation of the mask: the coefficients for the regularization : , = , : , = in equation (2) .\n\ns_08881: While these theories have been influential in understanding how young people 'choose' and conceptualize their future (see, for example, Anderson et al., 2005; Vinken, 2007; Woodman, 2011) , others have argued that neither risk nor neoliberalism are able to explain the diversity of circumstances that shape the lives and views of young people.\n\ns_08931: The probability density function (PDF) for the power distribution and low-to high-variance lognormal distributions.\n\ns_08981: [30] Figure 14 shows the cumulative irradiance at the time of breakup for different start dates of integration.\n\ns_09031: These findings could reflect real differences in the prevalence of open campus policies in Oregon compared with other states, lending credence for further studying the Oregon context related to open campus policies and their implications for students' health.\n\ns_09081: These features include a TB depression at the high frequency channel (85, 89 or 91 GHz) due to ice scattering and lower frequencies such as 37 GHz principally showing liquid hydrometeor emissions near and below the freezing level.\n\ns_09131: Also, the optimal combination of PET and shape performed much better as compared to only using PET or anatomical shape information irrespective of the choice of classifier used (Fig.\n\ns_09181: Some data elements were only administered to certain subgroups of respondents, as also noted in table D-1.\n\ns_09231: One important aspect is the \"convenience factor\" for the RR crops.\n\ns_09281: Stage two introduced sex and BMI as covariates ( Table 2 , Model 2), and revealed BMI as a significant negative and independent Notes: Model 1 shows the beta-coefficient and p value from a simple linear regression model assessing the relationship between age and the log of cumulative daily activity counts.\n\ns_09331: In Section 3 we describe some aspects of the new user interface, particularly the part that facilitates the selection of the regions that can be studied.\n\ns_09381: Therefore, this outcome is in line with our previous observation (see Subsection 5.2) that FreeSurfer's hippocampus estimate tends to be more sensitive to disease than MorphoBox's.\n\ns_09431: Due to the high mean age of the sample (67\u00b113 years), 70% of participants included in the present analysis (229 women and 251 men) had evidence of calcification involving at least one aortic segment.\n\ns_09481: There are hundreds of coronaviruses are circulating broadly among mammals and birds that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [1, 6, 7] .\n\ns_09531: Furthermore, Ibrahim et al.\n\ns_09581: Then, the trim and fill procedure calculates hypothetical effects for potentially omitted studies and then reestimates the average effect size and confidence intervals on the basis of the influence of studies that would have been included in the analyses if they had been published.\n\ns_09631: This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, academic achievement, coursework FE, and school FE in columns 3 through 7,\n\ns_09681: For AD vs. CU, AD vs. LMCI, AD vs. EMCI, LMCI vs. CU, EMCI vs. CU and LMCI vs. EMCI, the proposed method achieved the best AUC 0.963, 0.899, 0.923, 0.948, 0.866 and 0.791, respectively.\n\ns_09731: We also checked for interactions between Career Expectations and the other independent variables and did not find them to be significant at the P = 0.05 level.\n\ns_09781: We need more indepth research, such as learning the optimal network structure from big data, for a practical application of deep learning in clinical scenarios.\n\ns_09831: In addition, Creswell (2007) suggested that qualitative research design is used to explore the solution strategies analyzed throughout different phases of the research.\n\ns_09881: Given the completeness of the datasets we consider, we assume that task groupings match those defined by the task-specific layer of the network, and multitask learning is performed using Equation 8 and Algorithm 1."
