The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01142: Using a combination of satellite altimetry data from NASA, recently available in situ Argo float data from the US NOAA and numerical modeling, this TC was studied in great detail.\n\ns_01192: To provide a more comprehensive picture, we analyzed data from seven studies in a metadatabase of AD clinical trials and observational studies.\n\ns_01242: From this combination of approaches, the key studies that were identified were produced by OECD (2016a), SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011), McKinsey and Company (2014), Pirzada and Khan (2013) , Ridsdale et al.\n\ns_01292: These tables aim to highlight the most meaningful conclusions from the studies collected.\n\ns_01342: In addition to the new data being acquired in WP5, existing data from previous studies have been collated from more than 3000 subjects, using 16 datasets from 9 of the consortium partners.\n\ns_01392: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents retrieval of SST dataset and diagnosis of the newly-reconstructed SST dataset.\n\ns_01442: More specifically, the study analyzes administrative data from fiscal years (FYs) 2001 through 2003 describing the outcomes of grant applications submitted by women versus men to federal agencies.\n\ns_01492: Th is was done by using 1979 to 2005 mean yields.\n\ns_01542: Reniers et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2006b , Kubatko et al., 2006 .\n\ns_01592: Processed reads were aligned against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank NC_045512.2) and consensus genomes were generated using BWA-MEM version 0.7.17 (24) and BBMap (27).\n\ns_01642: A database such as that proposed under recommendation (3) would facilitate such a comparison.\n\ns_01692: The literature includes single-institution studies.\n\ns_01742: Specifically, the proposed method is more powerful in handling informative missing data since the MBI reduces selection bias through aggregating more samples across different missing pattern groups than a single regression imputation based on complete cases.\n\ns_01792: We used R for all statistical analyses in this study [73] .\n\ns_01842: These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05.28 Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.\n\ns_01892: The second autopsy data table in the INDD contains the semiquantitative scores for all the areas included in the routine research diagnostic workup (Table EA2) , with fields for additional neocortical, subcortical, brainstem, and spinal cord areas.\n\ns_01942: Derived data supporting the findings of this study will be made available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\ns_01992: Table 2 provides details of the levels of statistical significance for each predictor.\n\ns_02042: 91 As of November 22, 2020, there have been more than 200 projects of plasma therapy for clinical trial research (Table 2) , based on data from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).\n\ns_02092: Data from the USA was obtained from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance and Epidemiology End Results Program (SEER) 18 dataset for the period 1985-2009.\n\ns_02142: Table 1 highlights these influential papers.\n\ns_02192: Incident dementia risk was examined by Cox regression with healthy agers as reference, adjusted for sex, race, baseline age, gait speed and memory.\n\ns_02225: Moreover, the associations observed for WMHs and FDG-PET, measured for different brain regions, were based on data sampled over time.\n\ns_02275: Further evidence was provided at the 2016 State of the Bay Symposium, where an observational study and a modeling study were both referenced to support the estimate that the sediment inputs are about 5 times too low [Chant, 2016].\n\ns_02325: All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)."
