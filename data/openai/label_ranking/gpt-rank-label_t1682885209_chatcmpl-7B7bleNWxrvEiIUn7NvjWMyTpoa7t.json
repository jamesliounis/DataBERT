The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06410: The top panel of Table 3 reports the estimates of equations (1) and (2) separately for rural and urban samples.\n\ns_06460: The DID estimate in column 2 suggests that overall, relative to the pre-COVID lockdown period, electricity consumption increased by about 20.8%.\n\ns_06510: Note, in addition, that this result extends to logistic regressions.\n\ns_06560: The largest number of firm applications were observed in these three virtual activities.\n\ns_06610: This section provides a heuristic description of the model, which is similar in many respects to the six-sector models developed in Mitra (1994) to examine the economic performance of oil importing developing countries in response to extemal shocks during the seventies.\n\ns_06660: In this case the benefits of an integrated approach have not been as evident in practice as might have been expected in theory.\n\ns_06710: The estimation method used was maximum likelihood allowing for an AR(1) error structure.\n\ns_06760: Recent progress on this, led by the central bank, PKSF and industry representatives, needs to be built on.\n\ns_06810: The estimates of a that use government agencies lobbying expenditures are smaller than those reported in Table 1 and the returns to foreign lobbying are somehow higher: between 62 and 97 percent depending on the method used to distribute government agencies lobbying expenditures across 2-digit ISIC sectors.\n\ns_06860: An asset-based approach has been adopted to guide the conceptual and analytical framework used for this study, whereby household assets are considered the \"drivers\" of growth.\n\ns_06910: Following this approach, Kelley and Schmidt (2001) and Williamson (2001) present evidence of adverse effects of high population growth rates on rates of economic growth; Williamson argues that the key demographic variable is the growth rate of the dependent population.\n\ns_06960: Columns 5-7 reproduce the results of columns 1-3, but estimated on this reduced sample.\n\ns_07010: The structural equation underlying the observed behavior is a decision model where households choose to move, if the benefits from moving are higher than the benefits from staying in a slum.\n\ns_07060: The evidence indicates that the impact of these policies on imports was only a fraction of the effects that the early 2002 devaluation of the peso had (Graphs VI.1a and VI.2a).\n\ns_07110: These patterns were evident even controlling for remoteness and education, which might be correlated with rainfall.\n\ns_07160: We report the results for an OLS model as well as for a Tobit specification where the dependent variable is constrained to lie between -1 and +1.\n\ns_07210: Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation of a given variable for lottery losers, the difference between lottery winners and losers, and the standard error of this difference.\n\ns_07260: However, the large differences across the countries concerned in the extent of their GATS commitments may provide information on the \"type\" of government and the perceived need or desire to signal this to the markets.\n\ns_07310: The positive and, for the GMM estimates, significant sign of the PC participants growth rate dummy (Row 3 of Table 4 ) suggests that PC-participants had higher productivity growth rates than non-participants throughout the period.\n\ns_07360: What has become of the implementation problem, of implementation-related issues and concerns?\n\ns_07410: Maitha (1969) estimates the area response for Kenyan coffee that depends on real producer price (Fisher lag: 1 to 4), lagged quantity of coffee, a dummy variable and a time trend.\n\ns_07460: In fact, Table 5 shows that on average net transfers from multilateral sources increased between 1984-88 and 1989-93 for-all groups except the high group (see next section).\n\ns_07510: In the Chilean case this difference has been remarkably small, as shown in econometric work by Walker (1991) .\n\ns_07560: LI' The findings of this study suggest that determinants of private investment in SSA countries do not follow the same pattern as in other regions.\n\ns_07610: BRANCHES, 1980 AD 1985 BRANCHES, 1980 BRANCHES, -1985 TABLE 16: DATA ON \"ENERGY SAvwNGS\" (1980 -1985 ."
