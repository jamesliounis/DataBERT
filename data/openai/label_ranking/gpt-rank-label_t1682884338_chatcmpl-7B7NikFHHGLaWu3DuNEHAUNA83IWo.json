The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07988: 177-FZ of December 23, 2003.\n\ns_08038: As shown in Table 5 , there is a trade-off between coverage and targeting.\n\ns_08088: The estimations mentioned in the text, reported in Serv\u00e9n (2004), employ a SUR procedure with fixed effects.\n\ns_08138: Indeed, in his pioneering study of world incomes, Colin Clark (1957, pp.\n\ns_08188: Overall, the authors identify three categories of people in the model: those who would always enroll in college, with or without the subsidy (24 percent of the population); those who would never enroll (46 percent); and the remaining 30 percent, whose enrollment depends on the presence of the subsidy.\n\ns_08238: In \"Calculus Challenges,\" we see how Jacksonville University has used discovery learning, writing, and judicious use of technology to engage their calculus students.\n\ns_08265: \u2022 Respondents: Individuals or institutions completing the survey instruments.\n\ns_08315: The same manual methodology was used for public health measures: the research assistant filtered the ACAPS dataset on the different categories of interventions (lockdowns, movement restrictions, public health measures, and social distancing) and orally listed the measures taken at the country-level with their dates.\n\ns_08365: The meta-analysis used effect size estimates and standard errors with a random effects model.\n\ns_08415: Some other dimensionality reduction techniques from Machine Learning field Segovia et al., 2012) , and feature selection techniques (Bicacro et al., 2012; Chaves et al., 2009 ) have been applied to the diagnosis of AD.\n\ns_08465: Additional indirect support for the hypothesis has come from studies of other central nervous system (CNS) proteinopathies (Forman et al., 2004; Ross and Poirier, 2004) .\n\ns_08515: This approach, which does not depend so much on historical data points -except for the validation --was later adopted and adapted by Barro and Lee (2013) , Cohen and Leker (2014) and De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2012) .\n\ns_08565: Note that Panels (e,f) selected a smaller number of FreeSurfer features even though the overall prediction accuracies of all three analyses were comparably high.\n\ns_08615: We therefore examined the impact of the 2006 legislation-as well as the association between urban and rural waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, and substance abuse treatment facilities-on buprenorphine distributed per capita over the past decade.\n\ns_08665: Singapore, for example, where the best results were reported in both subjects, practices the use of technology.\n\ns_08715: This software ingests model forecasts and observational data, fills in gaps and missing data, creates specific time series such as concatenated forecasts, extracts skill-specific parameters such as times and amplitudes of high and low water, and computes the skill scores.\n\ns_08765: Significant associations were observed between willingness to participate in health research and poverty level (\u03c7 2 The inability to afford health services and willingness to participate in health research were significantly associated (\u03c7 2 R-S (2) = 7.71, P = 0.02).\n\ns_08815: The following sections describe the evaluation procedure, the hyperparameters selection and implementation details that are linked to the classification of AD vs CN subjects with CNNs.\n\ns_08865: In order to explore the interplay between young people's views (attitudes and orientations) and how their actual life experiences are shaped by their age, the socialinstitutional context and, more generally, their backgrounds, we draw on both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\ns_08915: Monte Carlo and repeated samples -if we generate many repetitions either through random simulation methods or from many datasets (e.g.\n\ns_08965: [47] Differences in the dates of breakup and boating presented here may serve to illustrate that stages of the sea ice cycle are defined in relation to a specific purpose or use of the ice cover [Eicken et al., 2009].\n\ns_09015: We based this decision on our objective to develop a parsimonious regression model wherein we use alternative and related measures of the social environment discussed below (see Section 2.2.3).\n\ns_09065: Therefore, this multisensor-panel imagery can be applied for better analysis of these important TC characteristics such as eyewall development, formation of concentric eyewall, convective zones and cells, rain band formation, central dense overcast, shear, and low-level center.\n\ns_09115: Note that the efficient implementations of solution to the PLS via SVD uses the Gram matrix of inner products of the data.\n\ns_09165: For more detailed information on the specific contents of the BPS:12/17 student survey and on administrative data sources, see chapter 3, section 3.1, and chapter 4, respectively."
