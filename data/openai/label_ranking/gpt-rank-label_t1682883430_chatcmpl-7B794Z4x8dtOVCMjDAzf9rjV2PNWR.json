The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02228: A repeated-measures design was used to account for the multiple time points when patients were evaluated during the study, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-patient correlation.\n\ns_02278: We extracted the recent (\"present-day\") land cover data for the Jamaica Bay watershed at 30 m resolution from the National Land Cover Dataset (2011) (NLCD) as described in Homer et al.\n\ns_02328: Mean regional GM corresponding to each ROI was downloaded from a hierarchical parcellation MRI data set made available in ADNI from Davatzikos and colleagues (27, 28) .\n\ns_02378: 657 doi.org/10.1017/S0022112086001507.\n\ns_02428: 6,12 We used 4 different data sources in our analysis: 2011 Medicare Claims Carrier File to identify LVC services and spending, physician specialty, practice location, panel size, and patient panel characteristics; 2010 American Medical Association Masterfile for additional physician characteristics; 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level estimates for physician location characteristics; and 2013 United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) file to identify rural areas.\n\ns_02478: e, We compared mutational counts in GISAID data (from January to August 2020) and COG UK data (from March to December 2020).\n\ns_02528: As shown in Table 3 , the 75% z a -quantile of the jittered data evaluated at the mean of the continuous variables and the mode of the dummy variables is Q z 5 (0.75jX) 5 [5.584] .\n\ns_02578: Similar conclusions were reached by Nandeesha et al.\n\ns_02628: A prospective study by Ennis et al.\n\ns_02678: Combining the two projections with a unique national data set on SAT test takers, we predict the distribution of black test scores relative to those of whites in future years.\n\ns_02728: (2006), and 1992 and 2000 Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Provincial Land Cover data (PLO) acquired through the Ontario Geospatial Data Exchange (OGDE), we developed a common land cover classification, cross-walking land cover classes found in each dataset.\n\ns_02778: Briefly, the composite index was derived from the average of standardized values for each component variable; see Web Appendix 1 for more detail on index construction (17) .\n\ns_02828: Furthermore, path analysis was chosen, because it assesses the relationships among measured variables, which is the case of the variables in the present study (Chou and Bentler 1995) .\n\ns_02878: The most recent, and probably the most accurate measures are from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) Internet and computer use supplement, fielded in August 2000.\n\ns_02928: Race Also was constructed from several soirees of info:mat:kw The first source was the student selfreport (item 31A).\n\ns_02978: The Textalyzer web tool was used to process the data obtained through the focus group survey.\n\ns_03028: The Coordinating Center was responsible for clinical and MRI data including: case report form development, implementation of clinical and neuropsychological database, implementation of ADNI platform for structural MRI, MR sequences storage, MRI quality control.\n\ns_03078: This modeling framework is selected because of its wide application to many empirical studies and the fact that it is appropriate for a binary dependent variable.\n\ns_03128: In Table 3 we present the summaries of topic measures overall and for each partition.\n\ns_03178: (See Williams and Wright (1991, chapter 13) .)\n\ns_03228: [Insert Table 2 about here]\n\ns_03278: Although not the main focus of the paper, I\n\ns_03328: The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous empirical literature.\n\ns_03378: The data examined so far indicate that at least some CEEC seem to actively participate in them for two reasons.\n\ns_03428: We subsequently employed the Chow test to test for the equality of coe\u00a2 cients across the two subsamples in (15) , (18) , (20) , and (21) ."
