The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02375: 686 doi.org/10.1029/94JC00721.\n\ns_02425: used to adjust for the health distribution of the patient panel.\n\ns_02475: e, Distribution of GISAID samples (March to July 2020) and COG UK samples (April to December 2020) retrieved for this study.\n\ns_02525: A description of the survey and summary results are available from the OFRF (www.ofrf.org).\n\ns_02575: In an experiment conducted by Ploumidou et al.\n\ns_02625: Adapted with permission from Lupien et al.\n\ns_02675: We rely on several data sources.\n\ns_02725: Although data from an ongoing national program, the USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) set, covered the entire area of interest (the U.S. side of the Great Lakes basin), for the two time steps of interest, due to shifts in the processing protocol, considerable work, and additional datasets were needed to make these two time steps comparable.\n\ns_02775: Univariate frequencies and percentages of GA, household SES, and covariates were computed for the eligible target population, the 2-year analytical cohort, and the kindergarten analytical cohort.\n\ns_02825: These indices were chosen because of the need to use replicate weights for the analysis, as indicated by ECLS-B researchers.\n\ns_02875: * Household level screener questions There is a wide range of research available regarding response rates, some of which was discussed earlier in this paper.\n\ns_02925: The statistics in this report are population estimates derived from the sample described in the preceding section.\n\ns_02975: In order to increase the validity of the survey results, a detailed review of the scientific literature on the relevant topic was conducted before developing the survey questionnaire.\n\ns_03025: Sociodemographic and clinical features, neuropsychological performances, and ICVs were compared among clinical groups with the ANOVA for continuous variables (post-hoc analysis were done using Bonferroni correction), and with the \u03c7 2 test for dichotomous variables.\n\ns_03075: Such statistics are computed in the empirical section.\n\ns_03125: In a related paper, using the same transcript data, we have found that in villages where the position of Gram Panchayat president is reserved for women, women to tend to talk more during the village meetings (Ban and Rao 2008b) .\n\ns_03175: For a more extensive discussion of the rationale for public intervention in storage markets, seeWright and Williams (1982b) andWilliams and Wright (1991, chapter 15).18 Even if we ignore this difficult issue, optimization of the details of location and operation presents a challenging spatial-temporal problem that deserves considerable attention before the proposal is implemented.\n\ns_03225: We also present the results of the estimation of the model for various sub-samples of the data, which are split at the median of potential technology-selection variables.\n\ns_03275: Therefore, the data exhibit enough within-country variation for the identification strategy of this paper that, as previously\n\ns_03325: (See, for instance, Francois and Manchin (2007) and Iwanow and Kirkpatrick (2008) .)\n\ns_03375: Table 18 tabulates data relevant to these two questions.\n\ns_03425: See among others: White (1982) , Scherer and Ross (1990) , Schmalensee (1989) , Berry and Reiss (2007) .\n\ns_03475: The results can be summarized as follows:\n\ns_03525: For more information see Mobaraq and Purbasari (2008) .\n\ns_03575: Cross-sectional regression results are reported in Table 7 ."
