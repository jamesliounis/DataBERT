The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00222: Actually, the mean population represents the average time that a given population has lived in a year, expressed in person-years as a result (3).\n\ns_00269: All the test results were converted to T scores, a normally distributed scale with a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.\n\ns_00319: 83, 92 Less data are available on sexual function in the BLSA and MrOS studies 97 (Table 3 ).\n\ns_00369: Second, the rate and extent of adoption during Stage 10 will depend, to a large extent, on the availability of information about potential private benefits during Stage 9 as described in Lichtenberg et al.\n\ns_00419: White matter referencing, MC_CW = mean cortical region SUVR using core white matter as reference; MC_TW = mean cortical region SUVR using total white matter as reference; MCRSF_CER = mean cortical region SUVR using cerebellar cortex as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_BS = mean cortical region SUVR using brainstem as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_CW = mean cortical region SUVR using core white matter as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_TW = mean cortical region SUVR using total white matter as reference with RSF partial volume correction; delta = change in SUVR from baseline to follow-up; delta% = percent change in SUVR from baseline to follow-up; p is the strength of the difference between follow-up and baseline SUVRs based on a paired t-test; Rate = the annual rate of SUVR change; sample size is the estimated number of participants per arm needed to detect a 25% or a 50% reduction in amyloid accumulation rate due to treatment with 80% power and a two-tailed type-I error of p = 0.05 in a 12-month placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.\n\ns_00469: As de la Torre and Lee (2008) showed, the results of the DINA model are consistent with that of the IRT models for the same data.\n\ns_00519: The high resolution models used the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) to set the boundary condition and a mesoscale model, Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to refine the data to a 36-km regional scale (J. Stamm, personal communication) [24] .\n\ns_00569: That \"unsolicited\" approach has been particularly effective for such agencies as the National Science Foundation (NSF), whose mission is the broad support of virtually all fields of basic or fundamental science.\n\ns_00619: In addition, viral entry depends on priming cleavage of the S protein, between S1 and S2 and activating cleavage on S2' site.\n\ns_00661: [2002] showed local shoaling of the thermocline by up to 18 m in the Amazon plume area, which is in agreement with our findings.\n\ns_00711: Includ-ric Information Retrieval System (AIRS), Reing a quadratic term implies an optimal level of search Triangle Park, North Carolina.\n\ns_00761: A second limitation of the prior studies utilizing the original ECLS-K is the age of the data.\n\ns_00811: A qualitative approach was used to research this change intervention.\n\ns_00861: Ferruginous Hawk densities and productivity are closely associated with cycles of prey abundance (Woffinden, 1975; Powers and Craig, 1976; Smith and Murphy, 1978; Smith and others, 1981; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Houston and Bechard, 1984; White and Thurow, 1985; Schmutz, 1989 Schmutz, , 1991a Schmutz and Hungle, 1989; Poulin and others, 2001; Schmutz and others, 2008; Ng and others, 2017) .\n\ns_00911: It could be observed that the CNNs model obtained better performance than the RF method using shape and radiomics representations, and the performance under the ordinal ranking setting were generally better than their counterparts under the conventional multi-category classification setting.\n\ns_00961: Our work confirms from observational data that the signature of intense wind events on the state of the upper ocean in the region persists for weeks, and has the potential to influence air-sea processes on different time scales.\n\ns_01011: Implementing these into the program should be fairly straightforward.\n\ns_01061: (2002) provided statistics on the business income to total income ratio, the business net worth to total net worth ratio, the returns on assets, and Gini coefficients for both farm and nonfarm households.\n\ns_01111: However, other related work from Tulsa's pre-K programs has revealed that there is a large degree of variation in pre-K impacts more generally as a function of classroom instructional quality (Johnson, Markowitz, Hill, & Phillips, 2016) , which supports the general notions discussed previously.\n\ns_01161: The goal of this manuscript is to summarize some of the current efforts carried out by the international community to monitor the upper-ocean thermal structure that impacts the TC intensity in major TC regions, with emphasis on cyclones that reached the coast and caused coastal storm surge and inundation.\n\ns_01211: Interpretations: Although we found significant differences in rate of decline, most differences between individuals were from baseline ADAS-Cog values.\n\ns_01261: This paper assesses mechanisms to ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed using a standardized data collection framework to measure an internationally accepted digital literacy index.\n\ns_01311: For example, in a prospective study of 120 patients treated for current major depressive disorder, Ceroni and colleagues (1984) found that the majority of patients recovered within the first few months of treatment, but 39 percent were persistently depressed during the first year of followup [8] .\n\ns_01361: On the other hand, a negative correlation between sample size and accuracy might also be a sign of publication bias rather than overfitting.\n\ns_01411: (2004) identified interannual to interdecadal thermal variability of the JES upper layer (surface to 400 m deep) by analyzing a three-dimensional 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 gridded tem-perature dataset (1957~1996) using complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis with a high-pass filter of 7-year cut-off period."
