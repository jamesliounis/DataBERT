The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02572: A quantile regression for count data is estimated based on the demand of organic farmers for consultations with private information providers.\n\ns_02622: The conducted studies confirm the importance of carbohydrate and lipid disorders in the etiology of BPH.\n\ns_02672: A better understanding of these interrelationships between cortisol, cognition and dementia may open the door to new prevention and therapeutic options involving the HPA axis.\n\ns_02722: 8 This example is from Krueger (2003) .\n\ns_02772: Detecting landscape change is a complex endeavor, confused by changing data sources, varying data resolution and differential spatial extents, and finally, land cover classifications.\n\ns_02822: There was no statistical evidence of additive interaction between GA and household SES (P = 0.68; Figure 2C ).\n\ns_02872: Following the approach of Kenny (2009), the presence of significant indirect effects in path models was considered a mediation effect.\n\ns_02922: Low response rates were also experienced when respondents were pre-screened.\n\ns_02972: Standard errors for the estimates in each of the tables are presented in the appendix.\n\ns_03022: The procedure of the measure includes test tasks and questionnaires.\n\ns_03072: The aim of the I-ADNI was to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the NA-ADNI methods enrolling and assessing a naturalistic population.\n\ns_03122: Using the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) we analyze factors associated with participation in conservation, recreation and agri-tourism activities as a function of farm structure, farm financial measures, production practices, and socio-demographic characteristics of the farm operator.\n\ns_03172: 2)Standard errors, clustered at village level, in parentheses 3) p < 0:1, p < 0:05, p

national policy variation regarding trade barriers, subsidies, and taxes, all of which affect the relation between reported global prices and prices faced by consumers.\n\ns_03272: The first one is the trade literature on factor proportions and trade patterns.\n\ns_03322: Panel C -Main US sources August 31, 2008 to September 30, 2008 The figure shows the cumulative abnormal returns of banks with low and high wholesale dependence (25th and 75th percentile of wholesale dependence) in a window of ten days before and after the Lehman event of September 15, 2008 (Panel A), the difference in cumulative abnormal differential returns (CADR) between those two groups of banks and its 90 percent confidence bands (Panel B), and the difference in cumulative abnormal differential returns relative to the pre-event difference (the average difference in abnormal returns between these two groups of banks between t=-10 and t=-1) (Panel C).\n\ns_03372: More recently, Helpman et al.\n\ns_03422: For a detailed analysis of the role and impact of outward processing in 'East-West' trade, seeGraziani (1996 and.\n\ns_03472: 3 The \u2026nding that sunk costs in \u2021uence the size distribution of \u2026rms is also consistent with the predictions of the Stackelberg-Spence-Dixit model of entry deterrence.\n\ns_03522: Key features worth noting are as follows: 1) With a few exceptions (public debt and non-life insurance), the dynamic paths followed by all financial depth indicators in the higher income countries cross the cross-section paths from below, suggesting quantum jumps in financial development at the higher end of the income scale.\n\ns_03572: The graph resembles Figure 4 , although the relative magnitude of the decrease in the contribution of the within term is larger, whereas the improvements in the between, cross, and proportionate entry terms appear smaller.\n\ns_03622: Following Bakeart and Wang (2009) we use trend tests to detect potential changes in co-dependence.\n\ns_03672: 15 Most medium term projections assume high and rising energy prices-fueled by rising demand in emerging market economies such as China and India and uncertainties about available supplies created or rather resuscitated fears about energy security.\n\ns_03722: Section V highlights implementation issues.\n\ns_03772: Gauri and Brinks also identify mechanisms for generalizing the effects of Brazilian litigation, however, so we do not expect the benefits to be strictly limited to the -litigating class.\u2016 Still, the cases are largely expected by litigants to have purely individual effects, and thus should focus on more expensive goods and be less pro-poor."
