The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09803: The \"Participants Convenience\" sampling method was utilized to determine the study group (Merriam, 2013) .\n\ns_09853: We start with an overview of the Disease-Atlas in Section 2 and 3, demonstrating performance gains for tests on data from the ADNI in Section 4.\n\ns_09903: 19 There is a large empirical literature that attempts to measure the effect of immigration on local wages (see Borjas 1994 and Hunt 1995 for surveys) .\n\ns_09953: In general testing results could be improved and it seems to be feasible in the context of the findings in Tables 1 and 4 .\n\ns_00005: Thus, data obtained about a particular subject aggregates across laboratories, research projects, and data repositories, allowing for a consistent mechanism for the identification of a research subject across the entire research community over time.\n\ns_00055: More recent quasi-experimental research by Knezek et al.\n\ns_00105: The sample was selected using a clustered list frame sampling design based on births registered in the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics system.\n\ns_00155: We also use this data to do a direct comparison of the performance of our sparse version of cross correlation against the usual version of cross correlation.\n\ns_00205: In such records, we observed a series of sociodemographic aspects (like sex, age, and region of residence) of individuals reported as suspect cases of COVID-19 and the moment of detection of the disease in those who turned out to be positive cases.\n\ns_00252: In the present analysis we included the 4 tests of executive function and memory that were most frequently used at both sites.\n\ns_00302: Table 4 summarizes in detail the main analogies and discrepancies regarding the issues that have been mostly investigated by large cohort studies till now (Table 4) .\n\ns_00352: Other articles in this series highlight project results that document the economic benefits provided by these systems (Belayneh et al., 2013; Chappell et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) .\n\ns_00402: The sample size calculation was performed using MATLAB (R2015b) (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) function: sampsizepwr, in the statistics and machine learning toolbox v10.1.\n\ns_00452: This study showed the application of a CDA-based assessment for a large-scale test data set, which has been originally analyzed with a traditional IRT model (3PL).\n\ns_00502: These data are available at a 4-km grid scale as monthly temperature and precipitation and were rescaled to an 8-km grid to match the scale of the projected climate data [19] .\n\ns_00552: It is important to recognize the enormous value that that effort generated: not only was an initial human-genome reference sequence published, but the development of technologies and computational tools that have revolutionized biomedical science was directly supported and encouraged.\n\ns_00602: The study population included 29 samples in the proliferative phase, 29 samples in early secretory phase, 43 in the medium secretory phase, and 8 in the late secretory phase.\n\ns_00644: Again, the relevant annual mean values are summarized in Table 1.\n\ns_00694: ), Mulchi (1994 ), Stanford Research In-given standard.\n\ns_00744: In the next sections, we turn to an explanation of the methodological approach and an overview of the data.\n\ns_00794: The recent Global Information Technology Report (Bilbao-Osorio, Dutta & Lanvin, 2014 ) ranked the quality of the South African educational system at 146th out of 148 countries.\n\ns_00844: In another North Dakota study, Gaines (1985) reported that Ferruginous Hawks preferred to nest in areas dominated by pastures and hayland.\n\ns_00894: We used MRI data (total n=817 scans, with 228 NC, 236 sMCI, 161 pMCI, and 192 AD patients) from ADNI 1 to train the proposed classification model.\n\ns_00944: With this work we perform this analysis exploiting high resolution observational datasets for surface winds, sea surface temperature and sea surface height.\n\ns_00994: The stratification and slosh model will be developed by investigating the results of 3D numerical analysis using FLOW 3D, as well as investigating the results from experiments executed at ZARM."
