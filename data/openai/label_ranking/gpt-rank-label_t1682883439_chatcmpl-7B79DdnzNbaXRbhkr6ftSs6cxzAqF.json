The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_03478: The controls were selected iteratively, based on individual statistical significance and collective explanatory power.18 The level of GDP per capita at which financial services start to appear is measured by the intercept of the crosssection paths for the main depth indicators with the horizontal axis.\n\ns_03528: By using firm-level data to examine the impact of a major crisis on resource allocation this paper combines and contributes to several strands of literature that have evolved fairly separately up until this point.\n\ns_03578: This table shows the summary statistics for the distance-to-default measure for countries for which we have at least one observation.\n\ns_03628: the Cairns Group and the United States in 2000 and, more recently, Japan and Switzerland in 2008).\n\ns_03678: 16 Romp and de Haan 2005undertake a comprehensive review of studies analyzing the relation between public and economic growth, many of which focused on high-income countries.\n\ns_03728: This present paper builds on the data on success rates and overall implementation to analyze the distributional effects of the cases.\n\ns_03778: As a robustness check, we repeat the analysis with weekly closing data (140 observations) but report the results only for major specifications ( Table 8 in the Appendix).\n\ns_03828: Data from columns (2) come from simulations described in Appendix B.\n\ns_03878: A World Bank study on China (2007), later cited in China 2030 (World Bank, 2012), applied a methodology for outdoor air pollution valuation similar to the one utilized in this study.\n\ns_03928: See for exampleTanzi and Davoodi (1997),Bird et al.\n\ns_03978: The testing component of the survey was linked to an experiment that is described and analyzed by Thornton (2008) .\n\ns_04028: The largest and most complete study, however, has been the recent World Bank 42-country study (Gwatkin and others 2000) , based on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).\n\ns_04078: The paper is organized around ten basic questions regarding the promotion of funded pillars and policies to promote saving for retirement.\n\ns_04128: (2007) , Guariglia and Poncet (2008) , Cheng and Degryse (2010) , and Zhang et al.\n\ns_04178: 2See Freixas and Rochet (1997) for a useful description of the costly state verification approach to credit markets.\n\ns_04228: 19 There is a large literature on the (Pareto) efficiency of markets in which a moral hazard problem of the kind we have just described arises.\n\ns_04278: Subsequently these findings were confirmed by Burbidge and Harrison (1984) , Gisser and Goodwin (1986) , Mork (1989 ), Ferderer (1996 and others.\n\ns_04328: Since 1 The results from the estimation are given in Table 3 .\n\ns_04378: (2008) , which is relevant for our sample period.\n\ns_04428: We can then combine this with the lab-in-the-field evidence to examine the extent to which behavior in the game predicts take-up of the new product, and to help better understand the likely mechanisms behind any take-up.\n\ns_04478: 7 In order to make the results representative of the total population, the cross-country statistics presented in the following sections use employment adjusted weights.\n\ns_04528: (2009) and the related literature have in effect analyzed the determinants of a range of outcome variables.\n\ns_04578: Section 2 discusses the data and our methodology that follows the direct projection method mentioned above.\n\ns_04628: Where denotes the row vector of variables representing n circumstances and a corresponding column vector of parameters.\n\ns_04678: Our key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral M&A transactions."
