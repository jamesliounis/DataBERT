The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01275: The sampling frames were meant to represent at least 95% of the target population amongst OECD and partner countries (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2016b) .\n\ns_01325: Second, in most studies that assessed the characteristics associated with distinct clinical presentations or trajectories, methods of variable selection were not theoretically predicated.\n\ns_01375: Standardized and harmonized psychopathological, demographic, cognitive, and genetic measures are collected at baseline and during follow-up assessments.\n\ns_01425: As mentioned in Subsection 2.3, the standard deviation of JES SST shows that JES is influenced by differential seasonal forcings.\n\ns_01475: However, those interested in the representation of women in the federally funded research community may want to focus first on the representation of women in the applicant pool and their decisions to apply for grants.\n\ns_01525: State-level data for annual N fertilizer rates (per fertilized cotton acre receiving N) during 1964 to 2005 are archived at the USDA Economic Research Service.\n\ns_01575: To do so, the computed bed elevation changes at ten selected stations as shown in Figure 3 (a) were compared with the measured bed changes at the same locations.\n\ns_01625: When stratified by country, the .\n\ns_01675: However, a recent paper showed that a single combination of option settings yielded quantitatively very good results across a range of 3D T1-weighted image types in MS patients [57] , obviating the need for further adjustment.\n\ns_01725: Clinically, this finding is important in counseling patients on future risks and has implications for postdiagnosis screening and monitoring.\n\ns_01775: In this example, there are three sources and four groups with p 1 = p 2 = p 3 = 20 and n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = n 4 = 1000, where each source contains one relevant\nThe objective function f * (\u03b2).\n\ns_01825: As the strength of spatial filtering is to identify potential covariates omitted in the analysis, our findings somewhat challenge the literature that income inequality and social capital matter for mortality.\n\ns_01875: (See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.)\n\ns_01925: The neuropathological hallmarks of these diseases are identified as a result of the study of brain and DNA samples, and biobanks enable the collection of tissue and biofluid samples to accelerate the discovery of pathological subtypes and DNA to make associations between certain pathological subtypes with specific genetic abnormalities [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\ns_01975: A wealth of previous literature has demonstrated the excellent psychometric properties of the PCL-5 across various populations (Blevins et al.\n\ns_02025: A multiple regression analysis was undertaken on the total points score for all qualifying examinations using KS2 mathematics and English scores and playing an instrument or not as predictors.\n\ns_02075: There are a lot of clinical trials being conducted worldwide in assessing drugs and/or treatments for COVID-19.\n\ns_02125: These two key determinants may be \"imported\" at the time of immigration from high-incidence areas, such as Central America, and therefore may be instructive for cancer control among US Hispanics.\n\ns_02175: Thus, examination of the word cloud is useful to have a broad view of key areas of research in the 9146 papers.\n\ns_02258: DESIGN AND SETTING Cohort study among the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative clinical sites in the United States and Canada.\n\ns_02308: The historical 1609 landscape has an accompanying basemap based on the landcover classification for 1609 desribed earlier in the report.\n\ns_02358: The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership.\n\ns_02408: 154 Reanalysis (NARR, Mesinger et al., 2006) data to force the model with relatively low spatial\n\ns_02458: If the attributed PCP-patient relationship was weak, meaning patients often see a physician who is not their PCP the most times, our findings may have been driven by unobserved patient characteristics.\n\ns_02508: We evaluated multiple genomic, or sliding, window sizes (see Methods) and found a genomic window length of 2500 bp to be sufficient to ensure separability of site frequency distributions from simulated populations subject to neutral or positive selection (Supplementary Figure 1) ."
