The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07743: These Our second estimation, though much simpler, found lagged consumption and disposable income to be significant but did not 164 find any fiscal variables, interest rates, or private credit to be significant\n\ns_07793: Finally, as a further test of validity, we analyzed the data using nonparametric techniques (see Appendix B).\n\ns_07843: However, from the available data it can be concluded that recurrent expenditures have steadily grown and remain in excess of the self-generated funds for all towns.\n\ns_07893: The scant literature on this subject has concentrated on issues related to the reasons why tax holidays may be used as an incentive without trying to derive the effective tax rate on capital during a holiday (Bond and Samuelson [1986] and Doyle and van Wijnbergen (1984] ).2 The task of this paper is quite different.\n\ns_07943: A case study of water vending and willingness to pay which was carried out in Onitsha, Nigeria, in July and August 1987, illustrates how such studies can be conducted and what kinds of information they can provide.l\n\ns_07993: Anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign banks in particular have stepped up their acquisition efforts.\n\ns_08043: Table 1 reports wood and electricity expenditures as a percentage of total household expenditures for households in different income groups and regions.\n\ns_08093: [ ] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 s t r v dv t e T s C s I s ds DB t \u221e \u2212 \u222b \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = \u222b\n\ns_08143: Maddison (2002) gives only population and income shares, but if we combine this information with Maddison's own estimates of GDI per capita for India (see below), we can calculate $PPP income estimates for each social group.\n\ns_08193: People with favorable initial conditions, in contrast, place a very high value on the subsidy.\n\ns_08243: There is a great deal of experimentation across the board.\n\ns_08270: 20 Data is used to track trends at a pivotal transition point from college to employment.\n\ns_08320: An example is Elgin et al.\n\ns_08370: We tested for an association with the following SNPs; HFE rs1800562, HFE rs1799945, and TMPRSS6 rs855791 using logistic regression under an additive model and then combined the three variants in a GPS.\n\ns_08420: The proposed methodology has several stages: starts with a segmentation of the FDG-PET image, followed by a grouping of clusters to form regions with relevant information.\n\ns_08470: It is difficult to source the costs of an AD prevention trial for industry as only one such trial has been sponsored: a Ginkgo biloba extract study in France involving about 2800 patients over 5 years (Vellas et al., 2006b) .\n\ns_08520: De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2000; also adapt the methods from Cohen and Soto (2007) and Barro and Lee (2010) to interpolate/extrapolate backward and forward by adding miscellaneous information and their professional judgment to create smooth time series of educational attainment\nOne of the main difference between all datasets lies in the original data that are used to either backproject, interpolate, or extrapolate as all estimation exercises including the WIC 2015 data set have to rely on an already existing data collection on education by age and sex.\n\ns_08570: A linear support vector machine coupled with feature selection was employed for comparison.\n\ns_08620: The RAND Institutional Review Board approved the study.\n\ns_08670: Questionnaires were developed for this purpose.\n\ns_08720: 22 For a general approach Dee 23 presented guidelines for standard validation documents and processes.\n\ns_08770: In adjusted models, significant associations between level of education and past participation held.\n\ns_08820: Once the architecture was chosen and the CNN was trained on all folds, the classification performance was evaluated on the independent test set to ensure the absence of overfitting.\n\ns_08870: Evans's (2002) research in Germany and the UK suggests that institutions also play a key role in explaining these cross-national differences.\n\ns_08920: The goodness of the fit depends heavily on where Table 2 ."
