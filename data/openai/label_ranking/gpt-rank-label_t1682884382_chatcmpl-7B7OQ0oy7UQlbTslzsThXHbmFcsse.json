The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07939: Since the results could be cross-checked with information from more than one source, it is possible to be confident about the accuracy of the general picture of water vending in Onitsha which is presented in this paper.\n\ns_07989: Although we are not faced with random samples, it is likely that due to deficiencies in the selection process Type II errors will dominate, resulting in too many banks being included in the DIS.\n\ns_08039: The assumptions of the policy scenarios considered here are summarized in Table 6 .\n\ns_08089: See Bassetto and Sargent (2005) for a historical background.\n\ns_08139: Area: Treadgold (2001, p. 5 ).\n\ns_08189: Not surprisingly, the individuals who always enroll in college -and place a high value on the subsidystrongly prefer the baseline economy with the subsidy, while those who never enroll prefer to receive the stock index retirement fund.\n\ns_08239: Two-thirds of our departments of mathematics have recently implemented changes, are now implementing changes, or plan to change strategies for student placement within the precalculus through single-variable calculus sequence.\n\ns_08266: They gather information from different respondents (e.g., students, parents, or institutions) on different constructs and variables of interest, depending on the purpose and focus of the data collection.\n\ns_08316: The updated versions of the database can be downloaded from GitHub or OpenICPSR in Excel and Stata formats and can be imported into a variety of software programs.\n\ns_08366: In the AD cohorts a subset of samples have available APOE genotypes (table 1) inferred from rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.\n\ns_08416: Most of the techniques developed have focused on analyzing small parts of the brain like hippocampus (Gerardin et al., 2009) or the gray matter volume (Fan et al., 2008) .\n\ns_08466: As highlighted in a recent review (O'Collins et al., 2006) , out of 114 novel treatments tested in humans for stroke, only tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety in human studies to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\ns_08516: The detailed results of the projections are available in the Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer 16 website and analyzed in details in Lutz et al.\n\ns_08566: Table 2 summarizes the 5-fold cross-validation results for classifying HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD for each combination of six methods (SVM 10 , SVM 25 , SVM, EN25, EN50 and EN75) and three data sets (FreeSurfer, RBM, combined FreeSurfer and RBM).\n\ns_08616: Over that period, there was a slightly greater percentage increase in the number of waivered physicians in rural counties compared with those in urban counties, with 27.1 waivered physicians in urban counties for each waivered physician in a rural county  In contrast to waivered physicians, however, the increase in the number of opioid treatment programs and substance abuse treatment facilities providing buprenorphine was greater in urban than in rural counties.\n\ns_08666: A comprehensive explanation of the scaling process has been given by Gonzalez, Galia and Li (2004).\n\ns_08716: Specific methods for each process are discussed below.\n\ns_08766: Only level of education was found to be associated with past participation in health research (\u03c7 2 R-S (2) = 34.59, P < 0.001).\n\ns_08816: Table 3 These results highlight the stability of the method toward the hyperparameters choice, as two consecutive hyperparameter values led to two masks with a ROI-based similarity superior to the inter-subject similarity (0.80).\n\ns_08866: The young peer researchers were provided with training and support before, during and after their fieldwork efforts.\n\ns_08916: Finally, I tried fitting two different functional forms (power law, Michaelis -Menton) to this noisy data, and calculated a mean-corrected non-linear r 2 .\n\ns_08966: While we were not able to find comparisons between model forecasts and observations, Gudkovich specifies predictive success relative to climatology at 20 to 35%.\n\ns_09016: However, that particular measure of food desert tracts has the greatest amount of variability (SD = 41.97%).\n\ns_09066: The high-resolution airborne Doppler radar was recently used to update and extend these results [48, 49] .\n\ns_09116: al [3] offer a comprehensive review of this ongoing research."
