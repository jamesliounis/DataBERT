The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07421: In other words, this literature review stresses that our understanding of the quantitative dimensions of agricultural supply response is surprisingly weak given the importance of this assumed response to growth, poverty and the environment.\n\ns_07471: It is important to note that the fact that the high group is less constrained than the other groups, in the limited sense of having pure grants covering a larger share of its import bill, does not contradict the previous finding that the increase in total grants did ,9 Total transfers comprise those froi iultilateral, bilateral, and private sources.\n\ns_07521: For the plans that had at least 100 members, total reported cost was 796 million in 1988 (Trends in Pensions 1992, Tables A-17 and A-15).\n\ns_07571: If \"deindustrialization\" is in fact resulting as a consequence of structural adjustment, this can be observed by comparing the changes in the share of industrial value-added in GDP before and after adjustment and examining the growth rates.\n\ns_07621: Baund on calculatins using publishe raher than derived daft for brmach OVIO.\n\ns_07671: Creditor participation is the most crucial element for any successful resolution to a country's debt problem.\n\ns_07721: Section 3 models the implications of panterritorial pricing for transport policy, and applies the model to assess this aspect of the activities of the CIDT.\n\ns_07771: Generally, the data for developing countries is not always as complete and as consistent as developed country data.\n\ns_07821: The important question to raise is whether the linearized version of the nonlinear model is accurate over a sufficiently large range of the parameter space so as to include confidence intervals measured in the standard way.\n\ns_07871: (k) UWSDs in the eight project towns and Dodoma will reach a billing and collection efficiency of 80 % of all customers by Mid-Term Review (para.\n\ns_07921: In Table III If so, personal taxes imposed on domestic savers may only affect savings rather than the cost of finance faced by the firm that is determined exogenously in the international market.\n\ns_07971: The management of the ASWC was somewhat skeptical about the enumerators' ability to conduct survey work in Onitsha because a few months earlier they had attempted to do another survey and the whole enterprise had collapsed.\n\ns_08021: Moody's Investors Service, \"Russia\", Banking System Outlook, October, 2005, page 8.\n\ns_08071: 9 See \"Electricity Poverty and Energy Poverty,\" IPA report (October 2003) .\n\ns_08121: Likewise, let 0 ' with ) / ( < = \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 p z\n\ns_08171: The estimated commoners' per capita income of 4.92 taels should be contrasted with the estimated subsistence minimum (based on wage data) which was between 5 and 6 taels (Chang) .\n\ns_08221: But because the group that never enrolls is about twice the size of the group that always does, there is an aggregate welfare gain of about 1 percent from reallocating the provision of subsidies.\n\ns_08298: 5 Surveys are administered in paper and online formats and commonly administered in large groups settings with a proctor.\n\ns_08348: This coding allows researchers to differentiate the degrees of implementation of the measures.\n\ns_08398: The investigators within IGAP contributed to the design and implementation of IGAP and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.\n\ns_08448: The FDG-PET images have been pre-processed to minimize differences between images: each image was co-registered, averaged, reoriented (the anteriorposterior axis of each subject was parallel to the AC-PC line), normalized in its intensity, and smoothed\n\ns_08498: However, this will be challenging as biomarkers, imaging, or both will probably be needed to both select and stratify the sample population.\n\ns_08548: However the matching is better in the 1990 census year with 37 datasets out of which 24 are categorized as A or B, less so as we move back in time.\n\ns_08598: Elastic net identified a small set of meaningful imaging and proteomic biomarkers.\n\ns_08648: The relationship between 30-patient-waivered physicians and buprenorphine per capita dispensed was substantially different from that observed for the 100-patient-waivered physicians, suggesting that 30-patient-waivered physicians are not as important as contributors to the growth in the distribution of buprenorphine."
