The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01804: Following Tiefelsdorf and Griffith [51] , we only consider the eigenvectors that are statistically significant and help to explain the spatial variation in mortality.\n\ns_01854: These characteristics were used to link students in each of the datasets, thereby creating a type of \"synthetic cohort,\" to provide values for variables missing in the NELS dataset.\n\ns_01904: After they meet the necessary requirements, researchers are authenticated, and different levels of data access to the tables of the databases are granted to them.\n\ns_01954: 2012; Burdzovic and Brunborg 2017; Lee et al.\n\ns_02004: The research reported here adds to that evidence, although it is limited in scope and the number of variables which were able to be taken into account.\n\ns_02054: 27 It was deduced that SARS-CoV-2 forms clusters with suspended particles in the air, reducing the diffusion coefficient while enhancing survival and persistence in the atmosphere.\n\ns_02104: Raw frequencies and percentage of cases for available data from each nation are reported.\n\ns_02154: The altmetrics data was captured from Dimensions database which draws data from altmetrics.com of capturing online activity of research papers on Facebook, twitter, blogpost, news reports etc.\n\ns_02204: This study aims to estimate survival from the point of recorded diagnosis of dementia, compared with people without dementia.\n\ns_02237: Although the distribution of WMHs was characteristically skewed, its relationship with FDG-PET in the different brain regions was linear (data not shown).\n\ns_02287: Figure 3), accompanied with an intensive reading of the historical literature [notably, Bellot, 1917;Black, 1981;Munsell, 1882;Ostrander, 1894;Stiles, 1870;Taney, 1961].\n\ns_02337: Supplementary Text 1 describes a supplemental analysis among 227 participants, where MCI and AD groups were enriched for amyloid-positive status.\n\ns_02437: All regression models were weighted to take into account the oversampling of physicians in relatively smaller states.\n\ns_02487: All machine learning models were implemented in Keras using tensorflow v2.3.0 or scikit-learn v0.24.0.\n\ns_02537: We estimated selected conditional quantiles of the continuity-corrected counts by using the specification: The dependent variable shows considerable overdispersion because the conditional variance (24.32) is greater than the conditional mean (6.70).\n\ns_02587: We found significant statistical relationship (Table 4) between average blood plasma glucose (p = 0.0001), mean systolic (p \u2264 0.0001) and diastolic (p \u2264 0.0001) blood, total cholesterol levels (p = 0.00014), HDL p \u2264 0.0001, LDL p = 0.021, TAG 144.9 \u00b1 90.8 mg/dL in patients in study and controls group.\n\ns_02637: et al., 2008 ) studies exploring the relationship between episodic memory and cortisol levels have found an association between elevated cortisol and poorer episodic memory among older adults without dementia.\n\ns_02687: That is, we assume that black students who currently attend the best schools attended by black 11 The regression includes full interactions of individual gender, race, and 13 family income dummies and of race with 100 (10 mother's by 10 father's) parental education dummies.\n\ns_02737: This allowed us to identify and quantify the relative amount and types of change occurring generally across the entire basin, more specifically across both the U.S. and Canadian portions of the basin, and more explicitly for near coastal areas and watersheds across the entire basin.\n\ns_02787: Figure 1 displays hypothesized relationships among GA at delivery, prenatal and postnatal household SES, and cognitive outcomes based on existing guidance for representing effect modification in directed acyclic graphs (19) .\n\ns_02837: The maximum-likelihood method has shown to be a state-of-the-art technique for dealing with missing data, highly recommended by researchers (Schafer and Graham 2002) , and is robust to nonnormality in structural equation modeling (Enders 2001).\n\ns_02887: The 2000 CPS data found that people whose highest level of education is a Bachelor's degree or higher had the highest Internet use (74.5 percent).\n\ns_02937: At the cmcluskm of the report, a summary chapter (chapter 5) reviews dm major findings awl the policy implications.\n\ns_02987: In addition, the data comparison strategy, triangulation of data sources, and study validation method were used."
