The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02147: The present study is motivated by this and applies tools and techniques of scientometrics to uncover insights from research papers.\n\ns_02197: This study assesses whether this relationship exists in multiple other aging populations.\n\ns_02230: This is one of the first studies to examine these associations in a large sample of the same patients.\n\ns_02280: Our initial work prior to this project (e.g.\n\ns_02330: Linear mixed modeling, followed by least significant differences post hoc tests, was used to test whether demographics, cognition, and other variables differed by baseline diagnosis of CN, MCI, or AD (Table 1) .\n\ns_02430: Alhough it is not possible to determine with Medicare claims data alone, future research should seek to find if a larger total patient panel is associated with higher LVC spend-ing.\n\ns_02480: We only kept samples that were available across both GISAID and COG UK data sources at the time of this study.\n\ns_02530: The composite index of Internet use is:\nwhere U is the total number of sources consulted.\n\ns_02580: The analysis shows a relationship\nOPEN ACCESS\nInt.\n\ns_02630: et al., 2008; Beluche et al., 2010; Geerlings et al., 2015) , other studies failed to find such an association (Ouanes et al., 2017a,b; Echouffo-Tcheugui et al., 2018) .\n\ns_02680: To incorporate this trend into our analysis, we simply add this many points to each black student's SAT score in the 2000 data, after re-weighting the data to reflect income convergence.\n\ns_02730: Using the reprocessed 1992 and 2001 U.S. NLCD land cover data from Wolter et al.\n\ns_02780: A major strength of the present study is the utilization of a large, population-based sample of US children with rigorous, prospective measurements of cognitive development at multiple time points.\n\ns_02830: 1994; McLoyd 1998; Repetti et al.\n\ns_02880: We would also like to compare our response rates and rate of return to a comparable sample of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).\n\ns_02930: Chapter I discusses the purpose and format of the report and limitations of the study.\n\ns_02980: The analysis was conducted taking into account the objectives of the study.\n\ns_03030: Ideally, in order to minimize error variance, an ADNI like multi-site reproducibility using a large sample of volunteers scanned repeatedly at all sites and within a short period of time, should be used.\n\ns_03080: For the initial estimated model, all the available independent variables suggested from literature in table 1 were included.\n\ns_03130: They use data from deliberative polls, and measure individuals' preferences before and after the deliberation.\n\ns_03180: See Williams and Wright (1991, chapter 14) .\n\ns_03230: [Insert Table 8 about here]\n\ns_03280: The paper also relates to the literature on financial structure and riskiness.\n\ns_03330: We are thankful to Margareta Drzeniek Hanouz for making World Economic Forum (WEF) data available for this research."
