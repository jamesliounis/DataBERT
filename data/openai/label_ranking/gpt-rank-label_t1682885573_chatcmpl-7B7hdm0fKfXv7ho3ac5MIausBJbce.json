The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09545: Recently, Sree Chitra Thirunal Medical Institute and Technology in collaboration with Agappe Diagnostics Ltd. developed Chitra Gene LAMP-N that detects two different regions of N gene.\n\ns_09595: The effect size measure used in this meta-analysis was a standardized mean difference and was calculated by subtracting the mean of the personality trait scores at Time 2 from the mean at Time 1 and dividing this raw mean difference by the standard deviation of the raw scores at the first time point.\n\ns_09645: The estimates reported in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap in homework time is mostly due to the time use of high-performing and high-math ability students, as males in the top quartile of the distribution of math ability perform about twenty minutes less homework per week than similarly talented females.\n\ns_09695: Although the vertex-wise data can reflect local deformity of a small region, they are sensitive to noise and registration errors.\n\ns_09745: Most notable is the proportion of students who, in a sense, followed through on their eighth-grade science career choices-roughly half.\n\ns_09795: In the classification experiment, using features from the DBN with radial basis, kernel, linear, and polynomial achieved accuracies of 86.6%, 83.9%, and 79.2%, respectively, to distinguish MCI-to-AD converters from stable patients with MCI.\n\ns_09845: On the other hand, more strategies to solve problem 1 were used in phase 3 than in the first and second phases of the research, reflecting an improvement in participants' command of different problem-solving strategies.\n\ns_09895: This allows the parameters of the predictive distributions at t + \u03c4 to be computed in the final layer, i.e.h t = [h t , \u03c4 ].\n\ns_09945: The three countries examined in this paper (as well as China) were all closed economies for many years during which period their diasporas played little role.\n\ns_09995: 1. c4 = p1+p2-c3 which same as above except elementary teacher pertains for average salaries (P1) and average years of experience (p2).\n\ns_00047: The data collected in these ASD studies are highly heterogeneous, including those from clinical assessments, a wide variety of genetic and genomic measures, numerous different imaging modalities, and a range of quantitative behavioral assessments, such as eye movement tracking.\n\ns_00097: To verify model fit, we evaluated each model's goodness of fit using the likelihood ratio test to determine whether an additional covariate (or set of covariates) improved the fit of the model from each successive nested model (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1980; Menard, 2001) .\n\ns_00147: Replication weights were provided to make responses to the father surveys representative of children born in 2001 whose fathers lived with them or had regular contact with them.\n\ns_00197: We hypothesize this is because the simulated dataset averages the Dice score over several smaller anatomical structures in addition to the ventricles.\n\ns_00247: Furthermore, not every death assigned to a positive case implies that COVID-19 was the cause of death.\n\ns_00294: The rate of conversion to dementia after 2 years (GDS score 4 or higher) was analyzed for each of the MCI subtypes.\n\ns_00344: This correlation is particularly strong for free serum E 2 86,118,119 .\n\ns_00394: The analysis and results presented here are based on the assumption that no additional land is used for ornamental production.\n\ns_00444: These techniques require longer dynamic PET acquisitions initiated in synchrony with tracer administration and are less attractive because of increased participant burden, study cost and complexity of quantification.\n\ns_00494: Similarly, Im and Park (2010)\n\ns_00544: We used the RandomForests package in R to create our models [29] .\n\ns_00594: It is important to recognize how difficult it has been to carry out the science needed to deal with those disorders effectively and what is involved.\n\ns_00686: The intensity reduction (DI) is a measure for a TC's relative deviation from MPI and is defined in Section 2.3.\n\ns_00736: This study econometreport a 6.5 percent yield decrease for corn and rically estimates the impact of air pollution on corn soybeans resulting from an increase in the 7-hr and soybean yields, controlling for weather and mean ambient ozone exposures from 0.04 to 0.05 management practices, using farm-level data for ppm.\n\ns_00786: We then discuss the data and methodology followed by a discussion of results and implications for policy and practice."
