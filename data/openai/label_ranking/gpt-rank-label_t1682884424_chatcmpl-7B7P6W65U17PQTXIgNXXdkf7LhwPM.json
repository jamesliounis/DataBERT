The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00366: Also, WSIN allow growers to store historical, quantitative information from past days and weeks to show trends, overlay weather information and data, and incorporate other information to improve water and nutrient management decisions.\n\ns_00416: These criteria include low inter-subject variability in reference regions [15, 22] , strong group differences between control subjects and AD patients [15, 16, 22] , and, in longitudinal studies, strong longitudinal changes [16, 17, 25] .\n\ns_00466: DINA model was used in this study, because the DINA model requires an estimation of two parameters for each item, and the number of attributes does not affect the number of estimated parameters in the DINA model.\n\ns_00516: Most models based on known distributional patterns were acceptable to excellent, indicated by AUC values (Table 2) .\n\ns_00566: They typically use a variety of approaches, which may ultimately be specified by a funding agency through such mechanisms as requests for applications.\n\ns_00616: These recommendations were made in the infancy of the pandemic when little was known about the implications of the novel coronavirus on implantation and pregnancy.\n\ns_00658: According to Vincent et al.\n\ns_00708: egies for improving yields.\n\ns_00758: This composite measure is an established metric utilized in prior studies using data from the ECLS-K (i.e.\n\ns_00808: The data was analysed on completion of the LLP and did not have an action research orientation.\n\ns_00858: Beston and others (2016) identified the Ferruginous Hawk as a species most likely to experience population declines from wind facilities, based on a prioritization system that included metrics of turbine risk.\n\ns_00908: The structural variation between the hippocampus of AD patients and healthy subjects has been studied intensively (Qiu et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2015; Tsao et al., 2017) (Li et al., 2007; Chupin et al., 2009; Gerardin et al., 2009; Costafreda et al., 2011; Devanand et al., 2012; Ben Ahmed et al., 2015; de Vos et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Sorensen et al., 2016; Aderghal et al., 2017; Tsao et al., 2017) .\n\ns_00958: Having artificially weaker extreme winds in the first period of the dataset leads to miss events happening at earlier times, hence to have a poorer statistics overall, but does not affect our results otherwise.\n\ns_01008: Another important part of the future work will be the implementation of a sloshing model.\n\ns_01058: The regression results show different trends by household type.\n\ns_01108: We first replicated the associations between classroom age composition and children's learning and development, which were presented by Ansari and colleagues (2016) .\n\ns_01158: This can also be observed from the corresponding TCHP map (Fig.\n\ns_01208: For example, the mean difference in ADAS-Cog scores between the lower (MMSE 15-18) and higher (MMSE 23-26) end of most clinical trials after 24 months was 21.2 points (Table 4) .\n\ns_01258: From these selected studies, the core elements of digital literacy are identified and are organized into a digital literacy framework to highlight the commonalities identified by various authors.\n\ns_01308: Studies applied different statistical techniques, most commonly latent growth curve or semi-parametric group-based modeling, to identify trajectories of mood and anxiety disorders on the basis of the observed data.\n\ns_01358: 76 The combination of imaging and nonimaging data may result in a more accurate model with higher predictive power compared with that of previous prediction tools, 42, 77 in particular, if different risk estimation tools are used in the context of a sequential and stepped assessment to enrich the risk prediction.\n\ns_01408: The zonal wind data were also from Climate Diagnostics Center derived NCEP Reanalysis Products with monthly interval and 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 spatial resolution over the common period.\n\ns_01458: If these covariates affect the funding NIH awards as they do at NSF, it is quite possible that the gender gap would be smaller if we could control for them.\n\ns_01508: When the experimental long-term standard deviations were compared with observations, CNTL (Fig.\n\ns_01558: The planning assessment procedure may briefly conclude as follows: (1) study the historical data about hydrology and morphology of the engineering site, (2) select the study area and computational domain, and generate numerical mesh to represent coastal/estuarine geometry and infrastructure (dikes, jetties, harbors, etc."
