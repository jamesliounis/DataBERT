The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_09983: The data for the variables are only for the top ten highest paid elementary principals in the state of Illinois.\n\ns_00035: NDAR also provides information drawn from NLM's PubMed for papers and the NIH Reporter for grant awards.\n\ns_00085: Next, we used model 5 to examine our findings for the 2001-2006 data set stratified by the four racial/ethnic demographic groups.\n\ns_00135: For example, Whitbeck et al.\n\ns_00185: We provide an analysis below for this value, and report results for SLCC with a neighborhood size =15, which we found to perform well given the sparsity in our data.\n\ns_00235: Standardized case fatality ratios (SCFR) and standardized partial death rates (SPDR) should be expressed as the following.\n\ns_00282: [33] employed a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in a similar MCI population and found conversion to dementia, within a 2-year time span, only in multidomain amnestic and multidomain nonamnestic patients, and not in any form of single-domain MCI.\n\ns_00332: Accordingly, the most important result reached by all the studies is to demonstratethe serum T decline with advancing age.\n\ns_00382: The number of liters of water applied per hectare of greenhouse operations was derived from the Horticultural Operations section of the USDA Census of Agriculture FRIS (USDA, 2010a).\n\ns_00432: For the ADAD population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with PVC may be optimal for current interventional trials.\n\ns_00482: In addition to item parameter estimates, the DINA model provides respondent parameters estimates (attribute probability and attribute prevalence).\n\ns_00532: Thirty-one waterbird species had prevalence $ 0.05 and were included in the focal group ( Table 2 ).\n\ns_00582: A focus on brain disorders is warranted by its contribution of lifetime disease burden and by the promising technologic advances created by the BRAIN Initiative and the development of tools that are advancing all biology, such as stem-cell technologies, production of organoids, and genome engineering technologies.\n\ns_00632: Understanding the pathophysiology of the virus and the target tissues at a molecular level can help clarify potential short-and long-term implications of infection on implantation, miscarriage, the intrauterine milieu, the placenta, and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (1).\n\ns_00674: Subsurface cooling due to modified light absorption in model studies has been previously reported [Lin et al., 2008;Gnanadesikan and Anderson, 2009].\n\ns_00724: First, portions extreme multicollinearity among the three fertilizof this region experience some of the highest levels ers.\n\ns_00774: Consequently, models controlling for prior achievement (columns 4-6) and socioeconomic status (column 3) actually result in a slight increase in the Asian-White gap.\n\ns_00824: Furthermore, the district office has an awareness of the local context in which schools operate (Taylor, Muller & Vinjevold, 2003) .\n\ns_00874: Kolar and Bechard (2016) cautioned that a high density of wind turbines near Ferruginous Hawk nesting habitat could lower reproductive success.\n\ns_00924: Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Deep Ordinal Ranking model.\n\ns_00974: These values correspond to 122 and 11 days featuring at least one intense event.\n\ns_01024: Visualization of the propellant management system is also possible (Figure 1 ).\n\ns_01074: Tukey-Kramer tests are used to test for the equality of mean income and net worth for all farm and nonfarm households and also based on household type and age group.\n\ns_01124: Because each of the assessments was scored on different scales, we created standardized scores for each and averaged them to create a composite for language and literacy (Time 1 \u03b1 = .65; Time 2 \u03b1 = .68; for a similar approach with comparable reliability, see Duncan et al., 2015) .\n\ns_01174: 3 Current research progress in major TC basins and surge events of high-impact TCs"
