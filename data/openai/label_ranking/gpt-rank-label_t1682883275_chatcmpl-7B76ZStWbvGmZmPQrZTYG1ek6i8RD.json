The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06174: Similar results hold after controlling for the background characteristics of respondents (see Table A8 in Appendix A).\n\ns_06224: These indicators are available in Appendix D,Table D.2 for the outlier countries identified in Section 3 of the paper.26 We are thankful to Francisco Ferreira and Beno\u00eet Decerf for encouraging us to delve deeper into this point.27 This decomposition is path dependent, meaning that the order in which we account for the various factors matters.\n\ns_06274: We present the results in Table 8 .\n\ns_06324: In contrast, in this paper, I use census data obtained from IPUMS International (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, IPUMS, 2019), hosted at the University of Minnesota Population Center, which reports harmonized representative samples (typically 10%) of full census micro data sets for a large number of countries.\n\ns_06374: (2008) , Azam and Bhatt (2015) , and Narayan et al.\n\ns_06424: (2017) and Isaksson and Kotsadam (2018) .\n\ns_06474: Source: Authors' own elaboration\n\ns_06524: The questions in the survey were drawn from previous surveys of TPOs conducted by the The number of employees in TPOs also varies significantly across countries.\n\ns_06574: See, for example, the surveys byTybout (1992).\n\ns_06624: The main academic contributors to the UK debate have been Goodhart (1996) , Taylor (1995 Taylor ( ,1996 and Goodhart et al (1998) .\n\ns_06674: These are the main questions we attempt to answer in this paper.\n\ns_06724: For instance, data collected by the World Bank in 1992 have been used to show widely varying results depending on the methodology chosen to assess impact.\n\ns_06774: The data set on foreign lobbying used in this paper was provided by the US Department of Justice.\n\ns_06824: Obtaining and analyzing data on this range of parameters is a major challenge for researchers and will require investments in data collection and analysis.\n\ns_06874: An important new source of information on socioeconomic differences in health indicators has been developed by Gwatkin et al., (2000) , based on the Demographic and Health 4\n\ns_06924: The model is based on Das and others (2004a) .\n\ns_06974: More specifically, in this paper we investigate the determinants of residential mobility in Bhopal, India, using a comprehensive household level data set.\n\ns_07024: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\n\ns_07074: Table 6 gives the sources and definitions of variables employed in this paper.\n\ns_07124: The data is obtained from Datastream.\n\ns_07174: Similar results are reported in Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd (2005) .\n\ns_07224: The data in table 2 are drawn from an analysis by Langhammer (2005) and reflect the same methodological approach as in table 1, i.e.\n\ns_07274: The joint significance of these two variables has a p-value of 0.003, suggesting the existence of cross-section selection bias with the OLS specification.\n\ns_07324: (paragraph 1.h) implementation capacities and to the assistance that they will be provided.\n\ns_07374: The level of aggregation depends on the objective of the study as well as the availability of data."
