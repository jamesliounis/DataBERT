The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_00026: 2011; Penagarikano et al.\n\ns_00076: For example, one study (Dabney et al., 2012) found that participation in OST science clubs and competitions had a strong positive association with college STEM career interest.\n\ns_00126: Third, the size of our subsample of teenage fathers who responded to the father questionnaire sometimes limited the power of our significance tests.\n\ns_00176: For clinical neuroscience studies, accurate registration of clinical images is an important step in analysis [31] .\n\ns_00226: One of the most significant challenges has been determining the most accurate indicators to compare the pandemic impact between different regions (e.g.\n\ns_00273: Reproduction of the RCFT was scored by the normative data from Meyers and Meyers [42] .\n\ns_00323: 53, 142 The longitudinal design of the studies came up progressively as the studies aged together with their participants.\n\ns_00373: For technologies whose benefits are clearly demonstrated in early trials (Stages 8 and 9), rates of adoption and the accrual of related benefits during Stage 10 usually follow an S-shaped path, as illustrated in Fig.\n\ns_00423: TOF-MRA data was acquired with during the same imaging session as the T1-weighted structural scan for the AQ cohort.\n\ns_00473: Although, our study demonstrated that retrofitting of a CDM via the DINA model can be very useful for the TIMSS assessment, it is evident that more benefit can be obtained from CDM-based analyses when tests are designed using CDMs in advance.\n\ns_00523: The number of records in the main test set was 817.The number of data records in the dry years set was 139.\n\ns_00573: The current federal partners include NSF, NIH, DARPA, the Intelligence Applied Research Projects Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\ns_00623: Multiple studies have also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor.\n\ns_00665: [2012] observe a reduction of 18.4/13.6 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 in CI for a surface freshening of 22.2/21.5 PSU in the northeastern Bay of Bengal/East Indian Coast.\n\ns_00715: The following linear production funclow dosages above a threshold (Lefohn et al., (1) research has been the incompatibility between air Linear models were found to perform better than pollution data and indicators of agricultural pro-logarithmic or translog specifications.\n\ns_00765: Kohlhaas, Lin, and Chu (2010) examined racial achievement gaps at third grade finding the Black-White gap to be slightly larger than a standard deviation and the Hispanic-White gap to be approximately 0.9 standard deviations.\n\ns_00815: The lead researcher of this paper, who was responsible for the data collection and analysis, was not actively involved in decision-making regarding the design and implementation of the LLP.\n\ns_00865: In another Utah study, nest sites occurred near cover that was suitable for black-tailed jackrabbits (Woffinden, 1975) .\n\ns_00915: Our results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than traditional multi-category classification techniques using shape and radiomics features from structural MRI data.\n\ns_00965: They are produced from the SL-TAC multi-mission altimeter data processing system.\n\ns_01015: It is therefore interesting to compare PMP with EUCES.\n\ns_01065: Poterba and Samwick (1997) found that there are significant differences in the portfolio allocation of wealth across different life-cycle stages using the Survey of Consumer Finances.\n\ns_01115: Because there were only a small number of 5-year-olds, we included them with the 4-year-olds (for a similar method, see Moiduddin et al., 2012) .\n\ns_01165: 2 Upper-ocean thermal structure and TC intensity The role of the subsurface thermal structure in TC intensity has been recognized for a long time (Leiper and Volgenau 1972;Holliday and Thompson 1979).\n\ns_01215: Of the 19 studies with 6553 participants, we excluded 6 studies that enrolled only participants with MCI or normal cognitive function, 1 study that did not collect baseline MMSE data, and 3 studies that did not collect ADAS-Cog data, leaving 10 studies meeting these inclusion criteria."
