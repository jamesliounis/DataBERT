The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_05211: Regressions control for household size, household size squared, the inverse hyperbolic sine of parental income, parent's years of education, age of child, age of child squared, gender, whether the child was sick in the past year, the number of times sick, total number of health visits, and survey round and market fixed effects.\n\ns_05261: G, (for instance to get a sense of the match between the actual efforts to maintain and the expected maintenance needs) and (ii) the capital expenditures, i.e.\n\ns_05311: Application of Formulae I and II at the primary level would mean losses of about 2.25 billion (1998) pesos for 17 to 19 states (Table 4) .\n\ns_05361: Section 2 describes the methodology.\n\ns_05411: Multiple Imputation Multi-variate Normal Regression employs a Data-Augmentation (DA) algorithm, which is similar to an EM algorithm but updates parameters in a nondeterministic fashion unlike the EM algorithm.\n\ns_05461: In this paper, we examine the patterns and economic effects of foreign direct investment across BRI countries in comparison to other nations and assess the potential role of BRI, by improving countries' physical connectivity and infrastructure, in shaping these patterns and effects.\n\ns_05511: The following concepts were defined and included in each of the questionnaires in order to assist contributors while answering the questionnaire, and the team during the coding process:\n\ns_05561: Note: OLS coefficients from a cross-country regression using the employment rate as the dependent variable.\n\ns_05611: \uf0b7 Under RCP4.5 emission scenarios, 10 out of 11 climate models are in complete agreement of a net increase in plant exposure numbers and users impacts for all flood exceedance probabilities in the near future.\n\ns_05661: Como en estudios previos (Gutierrez, 2012;
