The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_06689: Table 6 shows the decomposition of the flows until 1997  in millions of US$, whereas Table 7 shows the decomposition as percentages of the Capital Account, inclusive of net errors and omissions.\n\ns_06739: Goetz et al (1996) On the whole, the evidence presented by those who argue that microcredit improves female status within a household appears more convincing than that argued by the 'skeptics' camp.\n\ns_06789: The fourth column further corrects for the potential heteroskedasticity introduced by aggregating the data at the industry level when preferences are determined at the tariff line level.\n\ns_06839: Note: country case studies were carried out for Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras applying the asset-based approach for the Study \"Identifying Drivers of Sustainable Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction\" during 2002 to 2004.\n\ns_06889: In standard statistical sources, the CDR is measured as the number of deaths in the last year relative to mid-year population.\n\ns_06939: Not surprisingly, teacher attrition has received a lot of attention, both in the popular press and in institutional reports (our data and that from the census of schools in 2002 corroborates the high rates of attrition (Das and others 2004b)).\n\ns_06989: This is the focus of this paper in which we investigate what enables people to move out of a slum area into the formal housing market.\n\ns_07039: According to Consejo T\u00e9cnico de Inversiones S.A. (2002), in 2002 the following companies launched new projects: Grimoldi, in joint venture with Wolverini, Adidas, Alpargatas in agreement with FILA, Union, and Dexter Shops and Nike in agreement with Gatic.\n\ns_07089: We have found a number of relationships that appear to be robust to different choices of sample and different controls for spatial autocorrelation.\n\ns_07139: 4 See, for example, Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad, (2003) , Errunza, Hogan and Hung, (2000) , and Errunza and Miller, (2000) .\n\ns_07189: where Y it is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if child i is enrolled in school at the time of the follow-up survey (in the enrollment regressions) or working (in the child work regressions); \u03b1 c is a set of canton-level fixed effects; X it-1 is a vector of baseline child and household characteristics; Z i is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a family was a lottery winner; and \u03b5 it is the regression error term.\n\ns_07239: Descriptive statistics are generated on the extent to which EU members (EU-15) made market access and national treatment commitments in the GATS.\n\ns_07289: Note also that the dummy D,_ 1 (which is one in the year before the PC adoption) is not significant, suggesting that the reverse causality problem for PC participation should not be taken too seriously.\n\ns_07339: Table 5 .2 provides a summary of World Bank supported projects with trade facilitation components, including approved and projected projects through fiscal year 2006.\n\ns_07389: In that respect, this literature review supplements the previous ones as it highlights questions that were left out or insufficiently dealt with.\n\ns_07439: Rather than establishing a model to test for certain hypotheses, the paper keeps a descriptive analysis.\n\ns_07489: In this case we apply the contribution rate to the average accounting data on charges for 1989-91, to find the amount that must be put aside while active to pay the cost of an annuity.\n\ns_07539: One study 27/ attempting to explain the GDP growth of SSA for the period 1970-86, shows that the strongest explanatory variable is the growth of export earnings; even when the import growth variable is introduced,the result is unchanged.\n\ns_07589: An extenal researcher reports that visits to Jiangsu enterprises in the xiangzenQive category do indicate extensive mixing of data in current and constant prices, with enterprise leaders finding it difficult to explain which data are based on which prices (personal communication, July 1989] .\n\ns_07639: Availability of the set-aside amounts would generally be phased in line with program performance.\n\ns_07689: Combining Cote d'Ivoire data (available at the level of 56 zones) with different values of the elasticity of supply, it appears that: a.\n\ns_07739: - -------------------- ------------ ------- ------------------------------------------------------------- ------- ,----------------------- ------------------------ 1* 1e Wm AID osf lE 5D 1 9193 EIC.\n\ns_07789: Current research in the statistics literature has been aimed at resolving such questions using differential geometry.\n\ns_07839: The project is in line with the IDA Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Executive Directors in March 1994, and the Progress Report to be presented to the Board together with this proposed operation, in terms of (i) poverty alleviation through policy reform and economic growth; (ii) targeted interventions to improve urban services for the poor; and (iii) upgrading and expansion of basic infrastructure and urban services.\n\ns_07889: The post-holiday period user cost of capital is the same as that derived earlier for equation (73) except that r is replaced by r 1 (the cost of finance is the weighted average cost of funds in the post-holiday period)."
