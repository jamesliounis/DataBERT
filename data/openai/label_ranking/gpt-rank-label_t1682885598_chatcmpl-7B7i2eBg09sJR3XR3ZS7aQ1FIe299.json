The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08396: There is evidence of interaction effects, which would not be apparent in GWAS meta analyses, involving H63D and APOE \u03b54 alleles where the combination appears to affect age of onset and, to a lesser extent, risk [27] [28] [29] .\n\ns_08446: Moreover, with w = 2 and \u03d5 = 0.3 we have the lowest accuracy for different number of features and the maximum is when we have a space with 1000 features with an accuracy of approximately 87%.\n\ns_08496: Therapies that have advanced the farthest have primarily been developed based on the proposed initiating role of amyloid b-protein (Ab) aggregates (Golde et al., 2010) .\n\ns_08546: Another issue could occur from the reliability of the source data that would require the reviewing of data documentation and related literature to identify flaws in the census quality, or deviations due to education specific migration movements.\n\ns_08596: Its application to multi-modal imaging and biomarker data has considerable potential for discovering biomarkers and enhancing mechanistic understanding of AD and MCI.\n\ns_08646: 19,25 Our findings, however, suggest that the greatest impact on the amount of buprenorphine being dispensed came from waivered physicians able to treat up to 100 patients with buprenorphine.\n\ns_08696: In this paper, only the findings regarding teachers' qualifications and the use of technology in the mathematics and science curriculum are discussed.\n\ns_08746: Information derived from ecological forecasting, often based on coupled physical, biological and chemical models, is increasingly in demand.\n\ns_08796: 9 For African Americans and Pacific Islanders, one consistent issue hampering research participation has been distrust and perceived discrimination, owing to a history of research abuse.\n\ns_08846: We used as inputs GM probability maps, a proxy for atrophy, extracted from T1-weighted (T1w) MRI.\n\ns_08896: However, we have also included a few outliers and extreme cases to highlight the diversity and disparity of experiences in the sample.\n\ns_08946: Rosenzweig and Abramsky (1997) points out that even the weakest prediction (a qualitative yes or no) can be part of a robust test if we have enough of them -he calls this a ''dipswitch test''.\n\ns_08996: While previous studies often considered breakup at multiple locations, the transferability of our results will still have to be tested.\n\ns_09046: Additionally, aggregate data were used, thus potential individual level confounders were unmeasured and inferences based on these study findings are limited to the aggregate level.\n\ns_09096: The error trends of the TC's track forecasts have been consistently and significantly reduced in last few decades, while improvements on error trends of the TC's intensity forecasts are not so great [100] .\n\ns_09146: The motivation is to discover new imaging biomarkers and use them in conjunction with other known biomarkers for prognosis of individuals at high risk of developing AD.\n\ns_09196: Prior to sampling, NPSAS statisticians matched all students listed as potential FTB students within the NPSAS:12 sampling frame to NSLDS and CPS records, simultaneously, to determine if they had a federal financial aid history predating the NPSAS year (earlier than July 1, 2011).\n\ns_09246: However, most of the available evidence for RR soybeans shows slightly lower yields-as much as a 5.7 bushels per acre deficit in Nebraska in 1997.\n\ns_09296: Age, education, employment status, and history of chronic conditions were derived from a health history interview conducted by a nurse practitioner.\n\ns_09346: All three vector methods showed good agreement of the diagnosis with the ground truth data, but the SVM method yielded the best results.\n\ns_09396: (2011) in the AD vs normal classification among over twenty method variants, and the experimentally observed accuracy levels are consistent with previous studies that used the same implementation (Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008; Cuingnet et al., 2011) .\n\ns_09446: Further prospective studies are encouraged in order to test whether such interventions may help preventing not only bone demineralization but also vascular calcification that happen with aging.\n\ns_09496: The primers used in the PCR reactions were 2019-nCoV_N1 forward primer (5 0 -GACCCCAAAATCAGC GAAAT-3 0 ), 2019-nCoV_N2 reverse primer (5'-GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA-3') and 2019-nCoV_N3 forward primer (5'-GGGAGCCTTGAATACACCAAAA-3'), and 2019-nCoV N2 reverse primer (5'-GCG CGACATTCCGAAGAA-3'), respectively.\n\ns_09546: Further, ACE2 expression and its organ wise distribution is significantly associated with COVID-19 clinical symptoms [25, 48] .\n\ns_09596: These findings imply that longer longitudinal studies will provide larger estimates of change, a result that needs to be taken into consideration when planning new studies and evaluating the results of existing longitudinal research."
