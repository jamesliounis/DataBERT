The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01985: Additionally, psychometrically valid and frequently used measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD were included in the study which may aid future comparisons.\n\ns_02035: This included the number of subjects taken, the average point score obtained, the total score point obtained, and the capped score obtained when performance in the best eight subjects was taken into account.\n\ns_02085: 32 It was observed that COVID-19 patients have high levels of IL-1b, chemokine (C\u2212X\u2212C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which may activate the T helper cell 1 (Th1) cellular response.\n\ns_02135: These findings are consistent with global observations: as countries progress through the epidemiologic transition, there is a drop in gastric carcinoma incidence primarily due to the decrease in the intestinal-type gastric cancer, which is in turn likely related to the decline in H. pylori infection rates and other environmental factors [23, 24] .\n\ns_02185: One useful method would be from online trends surrounding this disease that would indicate to some extent the key issues that are influencing the society at large.\n\ns_02268: Compared with estimates based on WMHs from a single time point (eg, baseline assessment only), the estimates from this study may better represent biologic changes concomitant with brain aging and age-related brain disease.\n\ns_02318: The results are analyzed, flood probabilities computed, and resulting simplified estimates of flood heights placed into the tool for rapid retrieval.\n\ns_02368: These results suggest that this ADNI subcohort shows the typical progressive hypometabolism from CN, to MCI, to AD (31-33).\n\ns_02418: 573 National Science Foundation.\n\ns_02468: 5 In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of physicians who have patients with lower LVC spending.\n\ns_02518: We retained 28,350 samples in our final analysis.\n\ns_02568: The presence of missing values for consultations with a private information provider when organic farmers did not respond to some of the questions may lead to some selectivity biases associated with these farmers.\n\ns_02618: This hypothesis has been confirmed by Kleinberg et al.\n\ns_02668: Objective: To examine the interrelationships between cortisol, cognitive impairment and AD.\n\ns_02718: However, because black students are only moderately overrepresented among the additional students admitted under income-based preferences, and because the students brought in under these preferences comprise only a small share of the baseline class, the effect on total black representation is relatively modest.\n\ns_02768: aggregating the four development classes available in the Wolter et al.\n\ns_02818: In our study, estimated disparities comparing the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups were larger than those comparing early preterm with term children and term-born children in the lowest SES quintile had predicted scores lower than most preterm groups in the highest SES quintile.\n\ns_02868: One of the main findings of this study was that length of maternity leave had a direct effect on the quality of mother-child interactions.\n\ns_02918: Compared to traditional research methodologies, online studies are conducted with an average savings of more than 40 percent in cost and cycle time (Rosenblum and Grecco, 1998).\n\ns_02968: This composite is a scale that included such questions as wixther students placed a high pricaity an learning, whether teachers encouraged students to do their best, whether students were expected to do homework, and whetha they faced competition for grades.\n\ns_03018: , and lasted for the first half of 2019.\n\ns_03068: Conclusion: This study has provided standardization of MRI acquisition and imaging marker collection across different Italian clinical units and equipment.\n\ns_03118: These values are then computed by exponentiating the estimated coefficients for each variable.\n\ns_03168: In the appendix we provide a couple of examples of decisions.\n\ns_03218: In practice, postwar experience has affirmed that the \"finite time\" within which such programs fail is disconcertingly short, often less than a decade or two."
