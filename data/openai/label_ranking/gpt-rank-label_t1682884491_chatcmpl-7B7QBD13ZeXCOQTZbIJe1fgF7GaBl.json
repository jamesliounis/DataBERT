The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_02792: Findings were similar to our main analyses when using measurements of GA with last menstrual period, using alternative SES measures (including using the wave-2 measurement of SES quintile), and applying complex sample weights.\n\ns_02842: This measure was used to identify the sample of working mothers included in the study.\n\ns_02892: The literature reveals that two of the main factors driving the tremendous growth in online research are lower costs and response time.\n\ns_02942: A preface lists highlighted findings, tables, and figures included in the document.\n\ns_02992: Third, this study tested the framework and principles for monitoring primary school education process and addressed the aspects of its effectiveness (Hoover, 2009; Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016; Fulton, 2018) .\n\ns_03042: We administered a set of neuropsychological tests to assess long term memory (Story Recall Test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, recall), attention and executive functions (Trail Making Test A and B), language abilities (Letter and Category Fluency Test), and visuo-spatial skills (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, Copy).\n\ns_03092: But the lack of a \"state\" being significant suggests that there is a sample size problem.\n\ns_03142: For each paragraph the topics mentioned were recorded via two methods: First, topics were manually coded, by reading every transcript and noting the topics mentioned in each paragraph.\n\ns_03192: 3 The paper does not further address them except to note that these factors, although an important influence on the tightening overall grain market situation in prior years, could hardly have been surprises in 2007/08 except to the extent that continuations of already established trends were unexpected.\n\ns_03242: The author uses manufacturing output shares and factor endowments data for up to 10 developed countries across 7 industries with data from 1970-1988.\n\ns_03292: The event study literature typically privileges the analysis of cumulative returns because the cumulative impact of the events is easier to visualize.\n\ns_03342: To avoid a significant loss of observations, tariff data for some countries were linearly extrapolated for pairs of countries that had at least two of the four years under study.\n\ns_03392: First, we use a narrow definition of parts to assess major developments in comparative perspective and identify variation, if any, in CEEC performance.\n\ns_03442: 6 In the presence of serial correlation, FGLS is preferred because it is more e\u00a2 cient and its test statistics are at least asymptotically valid.\n\ns_03492: To unscramble these effects we separate countries into four groups according to their initial per capita income (low, lower middle, higher middle, high) and plot the year-by-year medians for each of the groups, together with the underlying cross-section path obtained by averaging data over the whole period for which it is available.\n\ns_03542: McKenzie 2003 McKenzie , 2004 Fallon & Lucas, 2002; Manning, 2000 , Beegle et al.\n\ns_03592: In this table, we report the systematic variance attributable to global, country and size effects.\n\ns_03642: A response to this dependence has been investment abroad, in a bid to secure long-term access to resources.\n\ns_03692: Data on temporary, deficit-financed increases of government purchases in the U.S. yields estimates of multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 (Ramey 2011).\n\ns_03742: Our curiosity was triggered by a book that carried out detailed studies of SE rights enforcement in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and South Africa (Gauri and Brinks 2008) .\n\ns_03792: Section 4 contains a description of the data and our methodology.\n\ns_03842: (2006) lends some support to this conjecture.\n\ns_03892: Baseline health data for estimating the health impacts of inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene are presented in Table 4 .1.\n\ns_03942: When we compare the country classification reported in Table 3 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , focusing on 1994-2003, to Table 5 below (extended period from 1994 to 2009) , it can be seen that the classification of most countries is stable.\n\ns_03992: I use a subsample of 1006 married women who were interviewed at least once during the 2006 and 2008 rounds, when family rosters and subjective expectations were collected."
