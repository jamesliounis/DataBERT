The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_08308: The author used Stata 14 to produce the final spreadsheet.\n\ns_08358: In the AD cohort data sets we tested for an association between iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin GPS at each P value threshold with AD case-control status using logistic regression (performed in STATA v11) controlling for age, sex, and four ancestry principal components.\n\ns_08408: The first part of our experiments consists in the analysis of the influence of these parameters in the results.\n\ns_08458: Next Steps: How Do We Collectively Ensure that Novel Therapies Are Tested in the Appropriate Populations?\n\ns_08508: We focused on data from censuses available from IPUMS (Ruggles et al.\n\ns_08558: This study focuses on integrative analysis of structural MRI data and proteomic data from an RBM panel to examine their predictive power and identify relevant biomarkers in a large MCI/AD cohort.\n\ns_08608: We normalized the data by 10,000 state residents to account for the fact that the population totals by state differed substantially.\n\ns_08658: It is the most recent in the series of IEA studies designed to measure trends in students' achievement in mathematics and science.\n\ns_08708: In the above section, the general procedures of skill assessment are described, the relevant data variables, model run scenarios and statistical variables are defined, and target frequencies and associated acceptance error criteria for each variable are discussed.\n\ns_08758: PROC SURVEYLOGIS-TIC was used to accommodate the complex survey design in these analyses and estimate adjusted associations.\n\ns_08808: In this paper, we adapted the method of [8] to 3D medical images to find on which basis a network classifies quantitative data.\n\ns_08858: These ideas reflect wider neoliberal discourses about the power of human agency, and were most frequently manifested in our qualitative and our quantitative data by references to the importance of hard work when forging one's future.\n\ns_08908: Hilborn and Mangel 1997) .\n\ns_08958: RADARSAT and European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to complement the analysis were provided by the Barrow Area Information Database (BAID) project.\n\ns_09008: This study contributes to previous research by advancing a new empirical analysis of the prevalence of open campus policies among Oregon public high schools, and it is the first to identify multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding.\n\ns_09058: Other studies also revealed relationship between microwave imager data to TC intensity [62, 63] .\n\ns_09108: We adapt the PLS methodology for the purpose of extracting relevant features from the combination of shape and 3D-SSP data supervised by the clinical scores such as MMSE, ADAS, CDR and clinical cognitive status that are treated as global measures of dementia.\n\ns_09158: The participating institutions and several administrative data sources provided data to aid in properly classifying FTB students within the NPSAS:12 sampling frame.\n\ns_09208: However, we have omitted the USDA study by Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride (2002), along with several others, whose results were based on the earlier (in this case 1997) ARMS data.\n\ns_09258: predictor of activity (\u03b2 = \u22120.037, p < .001).\n\ns_09308: PARAMETERS In this section we introduce the parameters mentioned above, and give a short motivation for their use.\n\ns_09358: The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\n\ns_09408: Participants included in the present analysis were those with measures of pulse wave velocity, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT) images of the body trunk and abdomen collected at the same visit 10 .\n\ns_09458: In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of Vero E6, MA-104, SW-13 and HeLa cell lines to infection by SARS-CoV-2.\n\ns_09508: People who have some chronic medical comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, any lung problems or diabetes or who are older and have higher risk of severe illness (charted out in Tables 1 and 2 )."
