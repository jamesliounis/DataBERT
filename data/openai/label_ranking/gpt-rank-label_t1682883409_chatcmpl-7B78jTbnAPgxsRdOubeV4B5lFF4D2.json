The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_07277: 9We follow Li (1995) , which uses the same data set.\n\ns_07327: What progress has been made to address the implementation-related issues and concerns and the implementation problem?\n\ns_07377: The problem of data comparability is not equally explained in many papers using cross section or pooled data.\n\ns_07427: The five major conclusions of the paper:\n\ns_07477: To make up for the paucity of data on quality, we attempt a description of the services offered by each one of the pension systems discussed here.\n\ns_07527: Nonetheless, recent studies have utilized improved analytical methods, measurement techniques and data to test the validity of these arguments.\n\ns_07577: Together with data on the parameter,it should be possible to obtain some rough quantitative idea of possible bias in the output figures arising from changes in industrial organization.?\n\ns_07627: what considerations should the country take into account?\n\ns_07677: ' For my information on the CIDT, I rely onBeenhakker and Bruzelius (1985),DCGT (1986 and, and CIDT(various years).2 The approach that I use builC3 on the work byWalters (1968) on the Ellet model.Gersovitz (1989) applies this framework to some topics in optimal taxation and agricultural marketing.\n\ns_07727: The consolidation of all of the available data on the income and expenditure (and net operating profits) of the various components of the public sector showed us that, even excluding complete data on the state-owned enterprises, fiscal deficits in Ghana over the past two decades have been significant.\n\ns_07777: The results for the Peru Living Standards Survey data make use of this optimal window width and a Gaussian kernel.\n\ns_07827: Table 4 .4 summarizes the various scenarios examined.\n\ns_07877: This is a useful result for empirical work presented later in that it can be assumed that a C6te d'Ivoire firm that is given only a partial exemption during the last three years of the holiday, would still prefer to defer its depreciation deductions.\n\ns_07927: For a discussion of the various ways used to test the reliability of the bids, see Whittington, Briscoe, and Mu, 1987, and Whittington, Mujwahuzi, McMahon, and Choe, 1988 .\n\ns_07977: 32 SeeLaeven (2002) for a discussion of this issue.\n\ns_08027: A more detailed analysis follows, examining the pattern of energy consumption geographically, by income quintile groups, and across socioeconomic groups.\n\ns_08077: This is shown byTalvi and V\u00e9gh (2000) using data from developing countries, and byLane (2003) with data from industrial countries.5 As defined here, infrastructure includes land transportation, power, telecommunications, and water and sanitation.7 Jonakin and Stephens (1999) also document the decrease in Latin America's public investment over this period.\n\ns_08127: 29 Malanima, however, revises these original data, uses information about salaries and other sources of income, and constructs a new distribution (which we use here) composed of nine groups, each consisting of 10 percent of the population, and the top decile divided into three groups (see Malanima 2006: Appendix) .\n\ns_08177: 7 College enrollment and completion data come from the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study 2004/2009 and from the National Education Longitudinal Study for 1988, which followed a sample of eighth graders from 1988 until 2000.\n\ns_08227: Although this is not a new idea, the work of Axtell and collaborators represents the first real attempt to bring this to scale, and the article includes evidence of the effectiveness of this approach.\n\ns_08254: This brief highlights several national databases yielding datasets pertinent to students with disabilities enrolled in postsecondary education including technical and vocational schools, and 2-year or 4-year colleges.\n\ns_08304: Research assistants then confront the results from the scrapping to web sources and manually coded the items in the CoronaNet dataset.\n\ns_08354: The AD case-control cohort comprises the datasets shown in table 1.\n\ns_08404: The two parameters we are discussing affects not only the number of features of the space, but also the Figure 5 compares the best result obtained with the proposed methodology for each problem with the methodology using the voxel intensity.\n\ns_08454: Given that these trials largely lacked ancillary biomarker and imaging studies, one can speculate that the trial participants who developed significant symptoms of AD in the first few years of such trials probably had significant AD pathology at the time of enrollment."
