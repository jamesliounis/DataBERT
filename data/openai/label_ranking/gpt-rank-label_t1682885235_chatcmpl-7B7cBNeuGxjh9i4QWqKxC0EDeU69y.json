The output should not raise a JSONDecodeError when loaded in Python.\n\nGiven a list of sentences extracted from papers, extract the sentences that explicitly mention a dataset used in the paper. Only include sentences where the dataset is clearly and unambiguously named, such as LSMS or DHS. Exclude sentences that mention software used for data analysis, equipment used to collect data, or other tools that are not datasets. Also, exclude sentences that only cite a reference without mentioning the dataset. Also exclude sentences that refer to data computed by the author without mentioning the dataset used to derive it.\n\nYour task is to return the sentence ids of the identified sentences as a JSON array along with the reason why you included them. The output format should be [{\"sent_id\": s_XXXXX, \"data_mentioned\": true, \"reason\": <dataset name>}]. If a sentence mentions a dataset clearly and unambiguously, set \"data_mentioned\" to true and fill in the \"reason\" field with the name of the dataset\n\nDo not explain.\n\nText:\n\ns_01428: Lagged correlation coefficient (LCC) was used to investigate relationship between two variables.\n\ns_01478: At NSF and USDA, over a recent three-year period (2001)(2002)(2003), there were no differences in the amount of funding requested or awarded.\n\ns_01528: Th us, the two models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitudes.\n\ns_01578: Figure 8 (b) depicts the computed morphological changes in the estuary after the 100-year storm and flood, which quantitatively shows the coastal erosions in the river mouth, the breaching in the river mouth bar, the river mouth widening, and the offshore bar development due to the river sediment flushed down to the offshore.\n\ns_01628: A root-to-tip regression of genetic distance against sampling time evidenced consistent temporal signal in the sequence data ( Figure 2B ).\n\ns_01678: These scanner effects are important issues in most large-scale studies in MS, and this discrepancy merits further investigation.\n\ns_01728: To quantify the degree of survival difference, risk-adjusted 50th percentile (median) quantile regression for DSS was used.\n\ns_01778: , R, through combining informative estimating equations, e.g., utilizing the first several largest principle components (PCs) [50, 10] .\n\ns_01828: The findings of this study will substantiate the utility of ecological mortality research, and contribute new material and perspectives on discussions of segregation and health.\n\ns_01878: (See appendix B for details on the multivariate methods used here.)\n\ns_01928: These findings have been followed by a clinical and neuropathological characterization.\n\ns_01978: Additionally, while the utilisation of online survey methods was deemed the only safe way to gather such data on a large scale amidst a pandemic and has the added benefit of increasing accessibility to those groups who would be difficult to access via other means (Wright 2005) , it is also important to mention that our sampling strategy may result in self-selection bias (Bethlehem 2010) .\n\ns_02028: (2002) indicated a positive effect in some subject areas as did Cabanac et al.\n\ns_02078: 76 In addition, a scalable multipathogen detection platform based on CRISPR-Cas detection developed by Ackerman et al.\n\ns_02128: In Nigeria, information provided by a network of 11 hospital-based cancer registries proved effective to determine the most frequent cancer types and subtypes presenting to the health care system, prioritize resource allocation, and improve cancer care delivery [27] .\n\ns_02178: The network file was then run on Pajek software to create a refined co-citation network map so as to avoid overlapping of nodes.\n\ns_02261: In converters and nonconverters, the analysis was aimed at quantifying the association of WMHs and FDG-PET measured in different brain regions.\n\ns_02311: Their results were used to identify RSL in the New York City region at the time the map or chart represents, and have been recently confirmed by analysis of a new core in Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx (Kemp, pers.\n\ns_02361: Among MCI participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interaction (Table 2) .\n\ns_02411: 717 Xie, X., & Li, M. (2018).\n\ns_02461: The phy-   Table 1 shows that relative to the high LVC group, the PCPs in the low LVC group were on average more likely to be female (29% vs 23%), practice family medicine (52% vs 39%), and have a smaller Medicare patient panel (147 vs 189 patients).\n\ns_02511: Because our CNN was trained on alignments of 200 samples or sequences, we required approximately 200 samples per geographic region for analysis.\n\ns_02561: We apply a technique for estimating quantile regressions for count data, represented here by the number of visits that organic farmers make to private information providers.\n\ns_02611: The study showed a statistically significant relationship between the occurrence of hypertension and prostatic hyperplasia.\n\ns_02661: In clinical studies, most studies examining the link between cortisol levels and global cognitive performance among nondemented older adults found that higher cortisol levels have been associated with poorer overall cognitive performance (Lupien et al., 2007; Lee B.K."
