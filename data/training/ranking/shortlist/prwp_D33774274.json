    "This result is in line with the previous literature on cash transfers, which is large and has been reviewed extensively (Fiszbein and Schady 2009; Snilstveit et al.",
    "We present the results in Table 8 .",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "2015, Ganimian and Murnane, 2016; Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016 and Molina Mill\u00e1n et al., 2019) .",
    "To see if the program had an effect, we plotted vaccination rates by treatment group, for the baseline and for the endline.",
    "To determine whether larger amounts of cash had a higher impact on school enrollment, we present descriptive statistics on enrollment by different treatment arms, in the right panel of Figure 4 .",
    "Data on vaccination of infants shows that in 2012, 78 percent of children aged 12 months in Guinea had a vaccination card.",
    "These results are confirmed in the regressions presented in Table 4 , derived from Equation 2, in which we investigate the effect for each sub-treatment arm.",
    "In equation 2, the reference is the control villages, and T1, T2 and T3 correspond respectively to the treatment arms with transfers of 0, 70,000 and 140,000 GNF.",
    "Moreover, similar to the findings of Akresh et al.",
    "Baseline data was collected between May and August 2014 and endline data was collected four years later, between May and August 2018.",
    "Age differences in the treatment effect are confirmed in the regressions presented in columns 3-6 of Table 3 .",
    "We used the 2012 ELEP household survey that is representative of the population, and we find that vaccination rates increased from 70 to 78 percent of children between 2007 and 2012.",
    "In these two columns, we added an interaction term between treatment and a girl fixed effect.",
    "This may be an indication that the baseline study took place at a moment in which children had been out of school for a while.",
    "Hence, the variable of interest is the proportion of children that are enrolled in treated villages and their treatment status.",
    "This result is confirmed in columns 2 and 5 of Table 3 .",
    "Table 5 presents the results comparing treated and control villages, while Table 6 presents the results disentangling the different treatment arms.",
    "The first column of Table 3 presents equation 1, comparing treated to control villages.",
    "In Table 2 we show the baseline balance of the sample in terms of education measures.",
    "In this section, we analyze whether the program had heterogeneous effects by child ability.",
    "The selection of regions, districts and villages was jointly made with the National Statistical Institute of Guinea (INS).",
    "Following Equation 3, when we change our reference group to untreated households in treated villages, we see that the effect of the treatment is equally strong for those with the largest transfers, reaching almost 10 percentage points.",
    "It is remarkable that the group with no cash transfers (but in a treated village) also saw a significant (although smaller in size) increase in enrollment, of around 7 percentage points for all children (column 1), and around 11 percentage points for children aged 8 to 12",
    "The distribution of households between the four different prefectures is presented in Table 1 .",
    "The baseline survey was conducted in this context of the ongoing Ebola crisis.",
    "The endline study tested them at the end of a school year so some of the improvement may be due to a time-of-the-year effect.",
    "This is shown in Figure 21 , which we created from the 2012 ELEP household survey.",
    "This last finding is important as it provides further evidence on the need to tailor policy interventions for maximum impact.",
    "In our data, the main reasons given for not sending children to school are 35 percent because of its cost and another 13 percent because of the need for the child to work (at home, field or in town).4 The baseline survey was conducted during the Ebola crisis, but the question on enrollment refers to the situation just before the Ebola crisis.",
    "ddewalque@worldbank.org 2 France Strat\u00e9gie, mavridis.dimitris@gmail.com",
    "Specifically, we employ three different models.",
    "We also contribute to the literature on differential parental choices depending on children's ability as we find some evidence that parents send their highest ability children to school (Akresh et al.",
    "To estimate the effect of the program on the outcomes of interest, we rely on the randomized design of the program and run a difference-in-differences (DID) model.",
    "As in the previous results, the effects are much higher for the children aged 8 to 12, for whom the effect of the larger transfers reaches 17 percentage points.",
    "In the first column, we see that compared to the control villages, the effect of the treatment seems to be increasing for each successive group.",
    "The controls for individual and household characteristics such as age, gender, household size, and ethnicity fixed-effects.",
    "(2015) showed that the number of unvaccinated children rose significantly in all three countries affected by Ebola (Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia), contrary to neighboring countries Senegal, Mali, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.",
    "Beyond our post-epidemic context, our design with three different sub-groups allows us to obtain more specific contributions on the design and targeting of cash transfers.",
    "The distribution of this score by age at the baseline and endline is presented in Figure 16 , and by whether the child is schooled in Figure 17 .",
    "In the survey, we asked the household head details about 20 different types of assets they held.",
    "The lack of vaccination for children as a consequence of Ebola is documented in many reports and papers.",
    "To test whether high-ability children benefitted more from the program than the low ability, we add an interaction term between the treatment and the continuous Raven score variable, measured at baseline.",
    "It is worth pointing out that the effects of the program are not just related to receiving a cash transfer: compared to eligible households in control villages, enrollment rates increased more in eligible households that did not receive the cash transfer in treated villages (Table 3 , column 3).",
    "The INS released in 2012 a national household survey called the Enqu\u00eate L\u00e9g\u00e8re pour l'Evaluation de la Pauvret\u00e9 (ELEP).",
    "Our findings are less straightforward: we find evidence that for all children (aged 6 to 15), cash transfers whose amounts were doubled had larger effect on school enrollment (17 vs 8 percentage points, p-value=0,039).",
    "Section II describes the program, the country context, and the empirical strategy.",
    "In Figure 10 we present the average test scores by age for the treated and control villages for respectively the baseline and the endline.",
    "Visually, this suggests that perhaps it is the lowest ability children which were kept unschooled in the treated areas, or put another way, that the treatment effects on increasing enrollment with cash transfers were more focused on higher ability children.",
    "T-tests of means reject the null that there is one group with a different mean than the other, for each of the 6 different classes tested."
