    "This section focuses on the results from this study.",
    "The paper begins with the presentation of some data on child health inequalities in 42 countries.",
    "Source: Bhuiya and others (2001) .",
    "Source: Pande and Yazbeck (2001) .",
    "Some of these studies have looked at inequalities in child health across the distribution of income (or consumption) using data from surveys like the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) (Wagstaff 2000; Wagstaff and Watanabe 2000) .",
    "The largest and most complete study, however, has been the recent World Bank 42-country study (Gwatkin and others 2000) , based on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).",
    "\"See (Castro-Leal and others 2000, Sahn and Younger 2000, Yaqub 1999) for recent multicountry BIA studies or survers of the health sector.",
    "Estimates of this are also available from the WDI and again the most recent data are used.",
    "Are the data consistent with these predictions?",
    "The results of studies on trends in health inequalities are summarized in Table 8 .",
    "The 42-country World Bank study, which provided the starting point of the paper, reveals significant correlations between inequalities in different indicators of child healthmortality, malnutrition, diarrhoea, and ARI.",
    "The second part of the paper was concerned with the issue of how to respond to this evidence.",
    "Bidani and Ravallion (1997) also report the results of cross-country regressions aimed at shedding light on the effects of public expenditure and income on health gaps between the poor and the nonpoor.",
    "Tables 3  and 4 show the Pearson and Spearman (rank) correlation matrices for the concentration indices.",
    "The dataset on socioeconomic inequalities in child health includes three measures-mortality, malnutrition (measured by anthropometric scores (Alderman 2000) ), and prevalence of disease.",
    "some theory Rather than groping in the dark for empirical regularities in the data, it is useful to explore theses questions with the help of a simple stylized model ) that captures the essential factors accounting for the link between health and income.",
    "With data from household and community surveys, one can model the links between child survival and its determinants to estimate the responsiveness or \"elasticity\" of survival to each of its determinants.",
    "We therefore report some results for all four income measures, and in the regressions opt for the WDI data to limit the loss of observations.",
    "I am grateful to Abbas Bhuiya for providing me with the group sizes, which were not reported in the original article, to construct the concentration curves, concentration indices, and averages reported inFigure 14andTable 8.",
    "The final column in Table 6 allows us to quantify the impacts of the various variables in terms of their contribution to explaining the gaps in health inequality between the two regions.",
    "This index, it turns out, is closely related to the relative index of inequality (RII) widely used in the literature on socioeconomic inequalities in health (Pamuk 1985 (Pamuk , 1988 , and will produce identical rankings of countries to the RII (Wagstaff, Paci, and van Doorslaer 1991; Kakwani, Wagstaff, and Van Doorlsaer 1997) .",
    "Table 7 shows the derivation of predicted values of the under-five mortality concentration index for the two regions, along with the results of a decomposition which help us pinpoint the sources of the differences in health inequality between them.",
    "Table 5 shows the Pearson correlations between the (negative of the) concentration index for under-five mortality, various measures of income per capita, income inequality and the share of health spending publicly financed.",
    "The variable whose concentration index has the highest average correlation with the other concentration indices is under-five mortality-the average Pearson and Spearman correlations are both 0.60, and all correlations between the concentration index for under-five mortality and the concentration indices for the other indicators are significant at the 5 percent level.",
    "One measure that has the key desirable properties is the concentration index (Wagstaff, Paci, and van Doorslaer 1991; Kakwani, Wagstaff, and Van Doorlsaer 1997) .",
    "The results of the analysis reported here are somewhat discouraging, since the effect of the public share of health spending was insignificant and in results not reported above (but predictable on the basis of the scatter plot in Figure 10 ) was found to be very sensitive to the sample choice.",
    "One recent study that does adopt such an approach is that of Bhuiya and others (2001) , who consider the impact on differentials in child mortality (mortality between the ages of one and five) of an MCH program delivered by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease (ICDDRB).",
    "With better data one could try to \"drill down\" further to see how much of the changes at the community level were related to health sector changes.",
    "Table 2 reports the concentration indices for the health outcome variables for the 42 countries, along with averages for the sample of countries and three regional groupings-Asia, the Near East and North Africa (AsiaMNA); Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).",
    "A PCA was undertaken on the full sample for each country separately, and the first principal component was retained and used to rank households and thereby children.",
    "The paper then goes on to outline a simple stylized model that might help explain this variation in health inequalities across countries.",
    "For reasons indicated above in connection with the World Bank 42-country study, one would like to take group sizes and their changes into account.",
    "As the authors of the study note, the challenge is to find out which factors enabled the low-inequality to states to reach the poor to see if there are lessons to be leamed for the delivery of immunization services in the high-inequality states.",
    "Ideally, the control groups would have been matched to ensure comparability, but even comparisons with Brazil over the period in question would have been more illuminating than simple trends.",
    "The strongest correlation is with income per capita measured at the survey year in PPPs, but bear in mind that the sample size differs across correlations.",
    "Table 6 shows the results of a regression of the (negative of the) under-five mortality concentration index on the Gini coefficient of income, and the results of a regression including, in addition to the Gini coefficient, GNP per capita (at PPPs) and public spending on health as a share of total health spending.",
    "In a cross-section, one ought in principle to be able to parcel out the effects of policies along the lines of the cross-country regressions above.",
    "One very striking thing about the data on health inequalities from the World Bank's study is that, for the most part, it is the countries with the lowest average rates of under-five mortality and malnutrition that have the largest gaps between poor and non-poor children.",
    "These hypotheses are then tested on the data for the 42 countries.",
    "However, in the absence of data on health indicators by poverty grouping, they were forced to make distributional assumptions to \"retrieve\" them artificially.",
    "1 Typically these studies have been undertaken on a piecemeal basis by different authors with little regard for comparability of assumptions with other studies.",
    "This measure was constructed along the lines proposed by Filmer and Pritchett (Filmer and Pritchett 1999) through the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA)l on a battery of indicators of dwelling characteristics and ownership of consumer durables (e.g., flooring material, roof material, number of rooms in relation to household size, type of drinking water source, and toilet type).",
    "By applying these means (and a constant) to the coefficients reported in Table 5 , we obtain predicted concentration indices for the two regions of 0.106 and 0.",
    "But the fact that in so many pair wise comparisons one country does better on one criterion and worse on the other makes it highly desirable to have a means of capturing these two dimensions in one overall summary index.",
    "Of more interest are the almost universal significant (at 5 percent) correlations across these three groups of variables, the exceptions being the correlations between the concentration index for ARI and those of infant mortality and the two malnutrition indicators.",
    "This column is derived by applying the coefficient of each independent variable to the regional difference in the means of that variable.",
    "The World Bank study discussed above includes, in fact, distributions of utilization of key MCH services as well as key MCH outcomes.",
    "Comparing the results of different studies is thus somewhat heroic and runs the risk of showing spurious differences due to differences in assumptions.",
    "Examples for each are presented.",
    "These methods include cross-country comparative analysis, country-based evaluation studies with controls, benefit-incidence analysis, and decomposition analysis."
