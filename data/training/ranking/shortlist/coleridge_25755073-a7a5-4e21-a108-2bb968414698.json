    "In this section, we discuss the results in the context of prior literature.",
    "Similarly, data from the TIMSS study has confirmed racial achievement gaps in science at both fourth and eighth grade while results from PISA demonstrate a small gender gap at age 15 (Lee & Buxton, 2010).",
    "The present study fills this void by utilizing data from the newest iteration of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, making use of the newly added science assessments in the earliest grades.",
    "Data We utilized data from the newly released Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K:2011).",
    "In the next sections, we turn to an explanation of the methodological approach and an overview of the data.",
    "We handled missing data through case wise deletion and report weighted sample sizes that account for the complex sampling structure of the ECLS-K:2011.",
    "Our primary model was as follows: Where ScienceAchievement is the standardized science test score in either the spring of kindergarten or the spring of first grade for student i, and the covariates are binary indicators of gender or race/ethnicity.",
    "Further details on the assessments can be found in the ECLS-K users' manual (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b).",
    "Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for our full analytic sample as well as broken out by student race/ethnicity and gender.",
    "In particular, we standardized the measures using sampling weights and survey settings to account for the complex sampling design of the ECLS-K:2011.",
    "While the inclusion of school fixedeffects (column 8) did reduce the Asian-White gap, the fully specified model (column 9) resulted in only a slight decline in the Asian-White gap compared to the nearly 60% decline in the Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps.",
    "In particular, we standardized the measures within each year using sampling weights and survey settings to account for the complex sampling design of the ECLS-K:2011.",
    "Additionally, by replicating the methodological approach utilized by Quinn and Cooc (2015), we respond to increased calls for replication in the educational research literature (Makel & Plucker, 2014).",
    "Though notably smaller than the entire ECLS-K:2011 sample (n=18,174), this weighted analytic sample size reflects non-response on science assessments in kindergarten or first grade as well as missing demographic data.",
    "Table 2 shows results of regressions predicting spring of kindergarten science achievement progressively controlling for prior achievement in mathematics and reading, student socioeconomic status, and school fixed effects.",
    "Across numerous datasets, early academic achievement, particularly math achievement, has been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of later achievement (Duncan et al., 2007).",
    "Finally, we sought to provide context to the size of the race/ethnicity and gender gaps in science by comparing them to the corresponding gaps in mathematics and reading, subjects that have traditionally been the focus of achievement gap studies.",
    "For instance, in 2011, White eighth graders scored approximately a standard deviation higher than their Black peers while males scored approximately 0.15 standard deviations higher than females (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012; U.S. Department of Education, 2012).",
    "This composite measure is an established metric utilized in prior studies using data from the ECLS-K (i.e.",
    "We begin by framing the paper in the context of developmental theory and ecological systems theory and reviewing the extant literature on early science achievement.",
    "In the next section, we review the literature on early science achievement gaps and point to the need for the current study.",
    "A second limitation of the prior studies utilizing the original ECLS-K is the age of the data.",
    "Further details on the construction of the SES composite measure can be found in the ECLS-K users' manual (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b) Finally, we used school identifiers that uniquely identify schools, allowing for the inclusion of school-fixed effects in the analysis.",
    "Consequently, there is a need to examine science achievement gaps utilizing data that more accurately reflects the current policy environment.",
    "Using data from the new Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K:2011), our analysis provides first evidence on science achievement gaps in the first two grades of school.",
    "Kohlhaas, Lin, and Chu (2010) examined racial achievement gaps at third grade finding the Black-White gap to be slightly larger than a standard deviation and the Hispanic-White gap to be approximately 0.9 standard deviations.",
    "Importantly, the original ECLS-K data was collected before or concurrent to the implementation of important provisions of NCLB.",
    "The descriptive table provides initial evidence for disparities in science achievement across groups.",
    "The ECLS-K:2011 science assessment included questions pertaining to the physical sciences, life sciences, environmental sciences, and scientific inquiry (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b).",
    "Despite the insight gleaned from analysis of NAEP and the original ECLS-K data, there are significant limitations in the aforementioned studies.",
    "The ECLS-K:2011 employed a complex multi-stage sampling strategy to produce nationally representative estimates of public and private school students (Tourangeau et al., 2015a;2015b).",
    "Background The science workforce has been and continues to be characterized by an over-representation of White males (Hrabowski, 2011;Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010;Shen, 2013).",
    "We extend the literature by focusing on science achievement gaps in the first two years of schooling and by utilizing more current data.",
    "Our finding contrasts with the science gender gap observed at the end of third grade, estimated at approximately one quarter of a standard deviation (Kohlhaas et al., 2010;Quinn & Cooc, 2015).",
    "Consequently, models controlling for prior achievement (columns 4-6) and socioeconomic status (column 3) actually result in a slight increase in the Asian-White gap.",
    "These models allow for a comparison of the magnitude of race/ethnicity and gender gaps in science to those in mathematics and reading.",
    "The weights provided with the ECLS-K and used in this analysis, however, are designed to account for such missing data.",
    "Our analytic sample (n=10,050) included students with science test scores in kindergarten and first grade as well as available data on race/ethnicity and gender and dropped observations missing prior math and reading achievement scores, information on SES, or school indicators.",
    "These results are similar to those found in previous research examining the eighth grade science gap, which also found that prior achievement left the majority of such racial gaps unexplained (Quinn & Cooc, 2015).",
    "For instance, science assessments were not required until school year 2007-08, after the completion of the original ECLS-K data collection (U.S. Department of Education, 2004).",
    "Results from the NAEP, a nationally representative study, demonstrate that racial/ethnic and gender achievement gaps in science exist in fourth and eighth grade (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012).",
    "In addition to the primary model, we also sought to understand the factors that explain the gaps.",
    "Estimates are adjusted to account for the complex sampling design of the ELCS-K:2011 using sample weights and Taylor linearized estimates of the standard errors.",
    "As reviewed by Quinn & Cooc (2015), such disparities in the workforce can be linked to differential likelihoods to study and persist in science majors in college which, in turn, can be linked to differential preparation, achievement, and attitudes towards science in high school (Chen & Weko, 2009;Griffith, 2010;Riegle-Crumb, King, Grodsky, & Muller, 2012;Price, 2010;Tai, Liu, Maltese, & Fan, 2006;Wang, 2013).",
    "Our finding that the Hispanic-White gap in science is significantly reduced when controlling for prior reading achievement lends some preliminary support to this hypothesis.",
    "Recently, several studies have utilized the original Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to extend analysis a grade earlier by examining science achievement gaps in the third grade (Kohlhaas, Lin, & Chu, 2010;Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & MacZuga, 2016;Quinn & Cooc, 2015).",
    "We then discuss the data and methodology followed by a discussion of results and implications for policy and practice.",
    "We now turn to results from regression models exploring these gaps in more detail.",
    "Indeed, the empirical literature demonstrates the importance of early experiences both in and out of school on later educational outcomes (Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 2005;Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, & Yavitz, 2010).",
    "Collectively, these models allow for an exploration of the degree to which these factors explain the racial and gender gaps in early science achievement."
