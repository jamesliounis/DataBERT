    "It is worth noting that the size of the STM for developed countries is similar to previous country-speci\u2026c and panel-data-based empirical \u2026ndings (e.g., Gechert, 2015; Romer and Romer, 2016; Alesina et al, 2017; .",
    "The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.",
    "We use individual-level data from the World Bank's Global Findex which is a comprehensive data- respectively.",
    "31 Figure 6 compares STMs, on impact, from the calibrated TANK model (dotted bars) with the empirical estimates shown previously in Section 2 (solid bars).",
    "30 Initially, in our benchmark calibration, and in order to direct our attention to the role played by and , we calibrate the rest of parameters based on values frequently used in the literature for developed countries.",
    "Based on the empirical strategy discussed in the previous subsection, Panels A and B in Figure 1 show the size of STMs in developed (blue color) and Latin American (red color) countries, respectively.",
    "Pennings (2020) also provide some similar evidence for the United States.1 0 In fact, the contemporaneous correlation between quarterly changes of real GDP and real pensions and family programs spending is 0.09 (statistically not signi\u2026cant).1 1 See Appendix 1 for description of data de\u2026nitions, sources, and time coverage for each country.",
    "As it has been common in this literature, we now analyze which are the main macroeconomic variables involved behind the \u2026ndings of Panels A and B in Figure 1 .",
    "Measurement and sources of data regarding parameters and were discussed in detail in Section 4.",
    "Table A.2.2 reports marginal e\u00a4ects from probit regressions in which the dependent variable equals 1 if the individual is HtM and 0 if he/she is not HtM; both one-characteristic-at-a-time and all of them jointly.",
    "See their paper for a detailed discussion of social transfers basic trends, composition, rigidity, and business cyclical aspects of social transfers.9 In fact, the contemporaneous correlation between quarterly changes of real GDP and real unemployment insurance spending is -0.23 (statistically signi\u2026cant).",
    "3 It is worth noting that the empirical evidence obtained from properly adding interaction terms to empirical speci\u2026cation (3) with respect to country-varying variables , , and (see Sections 4 and 5 for measurement details) delivers the model-based sign estimates.",
    "We provide new empirical evidence on the size of STMs for a range of countries based on a consistent methodology.",
    "On top of questions FIN24, FIN37, and FIN38 (already discussed in the main text, sub-section 4.1), in this Appendix, we also used the following questions from Global Findex Data to help characterize basic relevant facts of HtM and non-HtM individuals:",
    "3 numerically in order to analyze the extent to which a standard calibrated TANK model is able to match key empirical regularities shown in Section 2 in terms of the size, main macroeconomic variables involved, and temporal pro\u2026le of the STM for both the developed and the Latin American samples.",
    "(2016) \u2026nd, following Kaplan et al.",
    "This is the \u2026rst paper to provide evidence on the size and mechanism behind the aggregate STM for emerging markets.",
    "6 Naturally, there is a large related micro-literature focusing on how speci\u2026c social programs can reach and impact vulnerable people based on their income levels, poverty status, and other socioeconomic/demographic aspects (e.g.,Grosh, 1992;Gasparini et al., 2013; Cruces and Gasparini, 2012).2 7 In fact, and based on a simple regression of against , we cannot reject the hypothesis that such a coe\u00a2 cient equals statistically one for the whole sample of countries (as well as for industrial and emerging markets separately).",
    "A \u2026rst group of studies relies on survey data on household portfolios, with an emphasis on savings, net worth, and the liquidity of assets (e.g., Aguiar et al.",
    "More recent micro-based evidence from individual spending data and local-based experiments also support, to di\u00a4erent degrees of explicitness, the relevance of \u2026nancial fragility on the marginal propensity to consume and on the size of local STMs (e.g., Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016; Egger et al., 2019; Gerard et al., 2020) .",
    "Subsections 3.1 to 3.5 present the model.",
    "one also included all possible interactions among these economic and demographic characteristics, the R 2 would reach about one-third (regression results are not shown for the sake of brevity).",
    "We follow Iacoviello (2005) in choosing a value of = 1:27, Y = 0:13, and R = 0:73.",
    "As in previous studies relying on data from developed countries, individuals living in households with higher income, greater educational attainment, male, and employed show a higher capacity to deal with a \u2026nancial shock, both in developed and in emerging countries (with even similar predicting capacity values among these groups of countries).",
    "In line with existing empirical papers based on data for developed countries, both samples also show that the e\u00a4ect on output is mainly driven by private consumption whereas private investment remains largely unchanged.",
    "Additional insigths regarding the relative importance of vis-\u00e0-vis driving large STMs Table A .4.1 shows on-impact STM values using our benchmark calibration and combinations of and which are allowed to vary between 0 and 1 in 0.05 intervals.",
    "These \u2026ndings are broadly consistent with those of other studies focusing on the developed world (e.g., Lusardi et al., 2011) .",
    "Lastly, as the shock persistence has played a role in the literature in explaining the heterogeneity of the size of the multipliers (Coenen et al, 2012; Romer and Romer, 2016; Alesina et al., 2017;",
    "In particular, we take the average and for each sample in the Latin American and developed 2 8 Based on a simple regression of ST T against , we cannot reject the hypothesis that such a coe\u00a2 cient equals statistically zero for the whole sample of countries (as well as for developed and emerging markets separately).",
    "In their seminal paper, A second group of studies notes that holding assets is not the only means to cope with an unexpected \u2026nancial shock.",
    "to be calibrated for Latin American countries and \u2026nd, indeed, very similar results to our benchmark calibration due to the actual dominant role played by and .",
    "In particular, the quantitative STMs would have been 0.83 for the developed countries and 1.42 for the Latin American economies.3 3 The long-run multiplier is de\u2026ned as the discounted sum of changes in output divided by the discounted sum of changes in social transfers.",
    "In line with the literature available for developed countries which relies on liquid wealth (as opposed to total wealth which also includes illiquid assets, e.g.",
    "See Giambatista and Pennings (2017) for further details of this equivalence.",
    "1 It is also worth noting that the standard deviation of within each sample of countries is relatively low: 7 percent and 9 percent in Latin American and industrial countries, respectively.",
    "Gechert et al., 2020; Pennings, 2020), we estimate autoregressive social transfers growth regressions with a time trend for each country.",
    "3 0 We would like to thank Steven Pennings for sharing the Dynare code from Giambattista and Pennings (2017).",
    "As described by Jorda (2005), linear projections can be estimated by simple regression techniques (IV in our case) and they are more robust to misspeci\u2026cation errors.",
    "For example, Panel A reports that in Figure A.",
    "2 What is the current state of the literature on the size of the STM and the mechanism behind it?",
    "These studies rely on surveys based on self-assessed measures of one's capacity to deal with \u2026nancial shocks, regardless of whether the source of funds is the respondent's own assets, capacity to borrow, a network of family and friends, or something else (e.g., Johnson and Widdows, 1985; Worthington, 2004; Lusardi et al., 2011; Vandone et al., 2011; Brunetti et al., 2016) .",
    "Speci\u2026cally, LP (i) can be estimated by single-regression techniques, (ii) are more robust to potential misspeci\u2026cations, and (iii) can easily accommodate non-linear speci\u2026cations that may be impractical in a multivariate SVAR context (a feature that proves to be crucial in this paper).",
    "Panel A shows that the calibrated TANK model is largely able to account for the observed empirical evidence.",
    "The \u2026ndings support that individuals with higher household income, greater educational attainment, male, and employed report a higher capacity to deal with a \u2026nancial shock, both in developed and emerging countries (with even similar R 2 values among these groups).",
    "Panel B presents the di\u00a4erence in STMs between these two groups.",
    "The same lag structure was recommended when using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC).",
    "We use Teulings and Zubanov (2014) bias correction by including social transfer shocks nested between times t and h as controls.",
    "Existing empirical studies vary among several critical dimensions including the identi\u2026cation strategy, scope of the social transfer metric, econometric methodology, and country(ies) analyzed.",
    "On the theoretical front, the literature has mainly relied on di\u00a4erent variants of closed-economy two-agent New Keynesian (TANK) models which prompt consumption to play a dominant role in 1 For example, the \u2026rst phase of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States included one-time tax rebates to individuals, expanded unemployment bene\u2026ts, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) social transfers that represented about 586 billion dollars, or 2.8 percent of the GDP of 2019.",
    "Based on novel empirical evidence and quantitative results, we have shown the critical implications of having large shares of \u2026nancially constrained individuals on the size of the STM."
