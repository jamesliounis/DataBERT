    "(See, for instance, Francois and Manchin (2007) and Iwanow and Kirkpatrick (2008) .)",
    "For more extensive surveys of the literature, see, for instance, Maur and Wilson (forthcoming) .",
    "Tables and Graphs   Table A1",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous empirical literature.",
    "Table 6 here: Estimates on different samples.",
    "We are thankful to Margareta Drzeniek Hanouz for making World Economic Forum (WEF) data available for this research.",
    "Table A1 in the Appendix shows the loading factors of the diagnostic procedure as well as other statistics, The loading factors estimated in the explanatory analysis show a clear regrouping of the primary variables of hard infrastructure into two sub-groups that we call physical infrastructure and information and communications technology (ICT) because of the variables considered in each of them.",
    "One of the contributions of this paper is the construction of four new aggregate indicators related to trade facilitation from a wide range of primary indicators using factor analysis, a statistical modeling technique that explains the correlation among a set of observed variables through an unobserved \"common factor.\"",
    "10 7 For more details on factor analysis, see, for instance, Johnson and & Wichern (2001) and Reyment &.",
    "Column 1a in Table 5 reports sample-selection estimates using this procedure.",
    "Table 1 reports the final loading factors associated to each primary variable, as well as the percentage of variance explained by each identified factor.",
    "Although general estimates on the yield of these projects is difficult to obtain, Helble, Mann, and Wilson (2009) use detailed data on aid flows to estimate the responsiveness of trade flows to specific types of foreign aid directed to enhancing trade competitiveness in developing countries.",
    "The data imposes one single factor in each procedure of the second stage, according to an iterative standard procedure (see for instanceRayment and Joreskog (1996)).",
    "8 Data from the World Development Indicators was included for GDP and population and for variables included in the regressions for robustness checks.",
    "For this exercise, we retain a pool of 18 primary variables collected from different sources, such as WEF's Global Competitiveness Report, Doing Business, the World Development Indicators, 8 and Transparency International.",
    "We provide some statistics of the derived indicators across regions and years.",
    "Second, column 2 reports estimates when TF indicators are instrumented by their 3-year lagged value to reduce the bias that may arise from potential reverse causality.",
    "To avoid a significant loss of observations, tariff data for some countries were linearly extrapolated for pairs of countries that had at least two of the four years under study.",
    "When correcting the data-generating process to obtain a sample with an important amount of zero-value observations -a situation closer to ours -Martin and Pham find that the ET-Tobit and the two-stage sample selection estimates have a lower bias than those obtained with the PPML estimator.",
    "These studies show that estimates can be derived from different theoretical frameworks, such as the Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin, and increasing returns to scale models.",
    "The dataset covers 101 countries over the period 2004-07.",
    "20 Using Monte-Carlo simulations, they show that that the PPML produces estimates with the lowest bias for different patterns of heteroskedasticity.",
    "Our study also departs from most previous papers as we estimate the gravity with a two-stage sample selection model (Heckman 1979) as in Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (henceforth, HMR) (2008) to deal with sample selection bias due to country-pairs without trade (in at least one direction) and to examine the impact of trade facilitation on the extensive and intensive margins.",
    "See, for instance,Wilson et al.",
    "They constructed four indicators for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries for a single year by applying single averages to 13 primary variables, which were mostly collected from the WEF.",
    "Subsequently, Wilson, Mann, and Otsuki (2005) expanded their four indicators to a larger set of countries.",
    "Finally, we report in columns 4a and 4b estimates of a regression that includes an interaction term for each trade facilitation indicator with respect to per-capita income.",
    "It not only helps to circumvent multicolinearity by reducing the dimensions of the data, it is a less arbitrary and more rigorous procedure for deriving an \"aggregate\" indicator compared with averaging out primary indicators.",
    "For comparison purposes, column 1 reproduces the baseline estimates of the outcome equation defined by equation 1.",
    "Column 4 presents estimates of the baseline specification that incorporates the modified infrastructure index, which has a coefficient almost twice as large as the coefficient of the original infrastructure index in the baseline estimates (Table 3) .",
    "Again, the idea of this stage is to run a diagnosis as to identify sub-groups or primary variables within hard-infrastructure indicators and within soft-infrastructure indicators that would have higher correlations.",
    "Columns 1a and 1b report the estimated coefficients of the outcome and the selection equations, respectively.",
    "We took into consideration the disparities among countries by performing regional simulations using the best performing country in each index as the benchmark.",
    "Columns 1 to 4 report estimates where the sample is restricted respectively to different sectors: fuels, ores and metals, manufactures and textiles; whereas columns 5 and 6 examine exports from Southern countries to Northern countries and other Southern countries, respectively.",
    "To derive our indicators, we not only collect the WEF variables used by WMO and newly defined WEF variables 6 , but also incorporate recent indicators from other sources available for at least the period 2003-07.",
    "The new aggregate indicators contain the information of a wider range of individual indicators than any previous study.",
    "Using detailed data on transit, documentation, and ports and customs delays on Africa's exports collected by Doing Business at the World Bank, Freund and Rocha (2010) find that that transit delays have the most economically and statically significant effect on African exports.",
    "In the second stage, we re-run the factor analysis procedure on each of the four identified sub-groups in order to prevent the noise caused by adding variables that are unimportant.",
    "Columns 2a and 2b report estimates of a specification that replaces the entry-cost variable in the selection equation with a dummy that equals 1 if country i's exports to country j were positive in the previous year (t-1).",
    "11 In other words, we run four separate factor analysis procedures on each sub-group, with a single estimated factor retained by the data 12 , which will be considered as our indicator.",
    "However, Martin and Pham (2008) notice that the data-generating process used by SS-T does not produce zero-values properly.",
    "The first stage consists of a probit model determining the probability that a country pair engages in trade, whereas the second stage is a gravity regression augmented by a term correcting for selectivity that is computed from the first stage, the inverse Mills ratio.4 See, for instance, Santos- Tenreyro (2006, 2008),Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008),Baier and Bergstran (2009), andMartin and Pham (2008).",
    "Column 3 shows estimates of a Tobit model that takes account more properly of the censorship of the dependent variable, where the dependent variable is exports plus a dollar in logarithmic terms.",
    "Alberto Portugal-Perez and John S. Wilson All regressions include time and importer fixed effects.",
    "Francois and Manchin (2007) Unlike principal component analysis, factor analysis proposes an explicit underlying model that attempts to \"explain\" correlations among a set of m observed variables (X 1, X 2, \u2026, X m ) through the linear combination of a few latent (unobserved) random factors (Fs).",
    "Table 3 reports estimates for the two-stage Heckman selection model defined by expressions (1) and (2).",
    "The indicators are derived from a pool of 20 primary indicators collected from different sources: Doing Business (DB), World Development Indicators (WDI), World Economic Forum (WEF), and Transparency International (TI).",
    "More recently, Helpman et al."
