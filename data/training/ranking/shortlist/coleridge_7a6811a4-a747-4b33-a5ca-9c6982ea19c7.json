  "shortlist": [
    "Consistent with the findings of Starfield et al.",
    "We adjusted our model for demographic characteristics and health status of the PCP's patient panel by including its age, race/ ethnicity, sex distributions, and health status distributions, as measured by an Elixhauser comorbidity \"index.\"",
    "used to adjust for the health distribution of the patient panel.",
    "The standard errors of our estimates were too large to answer this question, but the coefficient estimates of rurality and family medicine were robust with its size increased, implying that rurality and physician specialty were independently associated with LVC spending (see Appendix Table 3).",
    "(Figure 2 and Appendix Table 2) Logit regression results were consistent with the above findings (Appendix Figure 5 and Appendix Table 3).",
    "6,12 We used 4 different data sources in our analysis: 2011 Medicare Claims Carrier File to identify LVC services and spending, physician specialty, practice location, panel size, and patient panel characteristics; 2010 American Medical Association Masterfile for additional physician characteristics; 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level estimates for physician location characteristics; and 2013 United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) file to identify rural areas.",
    "The population is another concern, as different studies have used different data sets, including Medicare data, Medicaid data, and commercial insurance data.",
    "Alhough it is not possible to determine with Medicare claims data alone, future research should seek to find if a larger total patient panel is associated with higher LVC spend-ing.",
    "16 documenting primary care's cost savings, Colla et al.",
    "However, a sensitivity analysis using the log per-patient LVC Medicare spending as an outcome showed similar patterns as our main regression results, implying that the results were not driven by outliers (Appendix Figure 2).",
    "Several sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of our findings (see Appendix for details).",
    "More detailed analysis of patient panel size and LVC could help to inform patient empanelment discussions.",
    "Our final sample contained 6,873 PCPs with 1,078,840 attributed patients.",
    "We explored whether specific PCP characteristics were correlated with observed variation in their attributed Medicare patients' overall LVC spending by using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model.",
    "All regression models were weighted to take into account the oversampling of physicians in relatively smaller states.",
    "Second, the long rightside tail of the PCP sample distribution of perpatient LVC Medicare spending in Appendix Figure 1 indicated that a small number of PCPs with \"extremely high\" LVC spending could be driving the results.",
    "These findings could inform a model of health system characteristics that lead to LVC.",
    "Through this method of patient attribution, perhaps this study adds to the evidence for the value of primary care in providing comprehensive, high value, evidence-based care.",
    "The authors of a National Academy of Medicine report defined unnecessary services as \"overuse-beyond evidence-established levels, discretionary use beyond benchmarks; [and] unnecessary choice of higher-cost services,\" and found that $210 billion per year is spent on unnecessary services.",
    "We added interaction terms in our regression models to explore whether the observed differential in LVC spending by rurality in our findings was due to differences in the composition of PCP specialty between rural and urban areas.",
    "PCP characteristics of interest included sex, years in practice, specialty, credential type, international medical graduate status, patient panel size, and practice location in terms of region and rurality.",
    "Our findings showed that rurality and PCP specialty were strong predictors of per-patient LVC Medicare spending.",
    "Studies select specific LVC services based on generally accepted guidelines, such as Choosing Wisely and the United States Preventive Services Task Force.",
    "We used a model of attributing patients to the PCP who provided the most care.",
    "Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of our findings.",
    "All above differences were statistically significant (P \u03fd .001).",
    "15 We also compared the adjusted odds of having high per-attributed-patient LVC spending across PCPs' physician characteristics by using a logit model.",
    "The estimates for allopath, rural, practice region, and physician specialty were robust to changes in thresholds of per-patient spending for the high LVC group, whereas the results for patient size did not hold when the threshold was moved to the top decile (Appendix Figure 4).",
    "Previous studies have shown that hospital-based practices and areas with higher specialist to PCP ratios have higher LVC spending.",
    "Unfortunately, our data set and methods did not allow us to elucidate the specific mechanisms.",
    "However, given that relatively more family physicians practiced in rural areas, it was not clear whether rurality and specialty were independent predictors.",
    "6,12 We used these measures to identify LVC services that are relevant to primary care, relevant to patients 65 years and older, and measurable using Medicare claims data.",
    "Perhaps a broader scope of practice (like that characteristic of rural physicians) may lead to a decrease in LVC services, although this will need to be directly measured in future studies.",
    "However, when we stratified LVC services by likely place of service, ones that were likely to take place in an office versus in a facility, the results showed no systematic difference (Appendix Figure 3).",
    "Lastly, to check whether the findings for the high LVC group using the logit model were robust to the per-patient LVC spending thresholds, we varied the threshold from the top 30 th to 10 th percentiles in increments of 5 in defining the high LVC spending group.",
    "If the attributed PCP-patient relationship was weak, meaning patients often see a physician who is not their PCP the most times, our findings may have been driven by unobserved patient characteristics.",
    "20,21 This study found that physicians are more likely to be in the high LVC group when they have more attributed Medicare patients.",
    "We also included ZCTAlevel socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of practice location to adjust for differences in communities they serve.",
    "The phy-   Table 1 shows that relative to the high LVC group, the PCPs in the low LVC group were on average more likely to be female (29% vs 23%), practice family medicine (52% vs 39%), and have a smaller Medicare patient panel (147 vs 189 patients).",
    "The sample distribution was skewed to the right, indicating the presence of a small number of PCPs with \"relatively extreme\" LVC spending.",
    "Previous studies had developed Medicare claimbased measures of LVC services.",
    "6,16 Our study did not include specialists in our sample, so it remains unclear if there is something unique about the physicians and patients living in rural areas that leads to reduced use of LVC or if the decreased presence of specialists leads to reduced use of LVC.",
    "12 It is also difficult to compare LVC studies because there is variability in the measure of LVC depending on the service measured, how it is being measured, and the population for which it is being measured.",
    "Although this limits what we can say about the individual PCP, it may add to the evidence for the role of primary care in reducing costs related to LVC (or in reducing unnecessary care).",
    "We had a nationally representative, stratified random sample of 38,516 physicians.",
    "5 In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of physicians who have patients with lower LVC spending.",
    "3 Studies have attempted to characterize patient and regional characteristics associated with unnecessary services, often referred to as low value care (LVC).",
    "Fourth, our exclusion criteria for LVC services were based on medical history recorded in claims before, but during the same year as the service date, due to data availability.",
    "For each LVC service type, we first identified qualifying patients who were eligible for the service based on diagnoses, demographics, and other criteria from all patients that had received the service.",
    "6 showed a wide range of annual prevalence from 1.2% to 46.5% depending on which LVC service is measured."
