  "shortlist": [
    "The SST dataset was mentioned above in Subsection 3.3.1.",
    "We evaluated the validity of such eigenvalues at the 95% significance level, assuming as null hypothesis that a dataset is randomly drawn from a population number of uncorrelated Gaussian variables (Overland and Preisendorfer, 1982) .",
    "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents retrieval of SST dataset and diagnosis of the newly-reconstructed SST dataset.",
    "For the analysis, subset data covering JES (127~142\u00b0E and 34~50\u00b0N) we extracted from the AVHRR Pathfinder SST data during the period of 1985~2002.",
    "These phenomena are interrelated (Wang et al., 2000; Gong et al., 2001; Wu and Wang, 2002; Lin et al., 2002; Gong and Ho, 2003) .",
    "Correlation coefficients were calculated between T(x, y, t) and T n (x, y, t) at the grid point (x, y).",
    "Optimal interpolation has generally been used to fill the missing data the, but this needs a priori information about the dataset, such as a decorrelation scale and signal-to-noise ratio.",
    "The correlation map is therefore appropriate to interpret the relationship of one variable (n-th mode SSTA) to the others arranged with background fields geographically.",
    "6(a) ) is not clear in spatial amplitudes using the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset (Version 2, referred to as OI dataset), which has been used widely in oceanographic and atmospheric research (Fig.",
    "All the data were prepared over the common period, 1985~2002, after removing the annual cycle and applying a 13-month moving average.",
    "In brief, the configurations of the AVHRR Pathfinder SST data are as follows: 18 km (approximately 0.2\u00b0 \u00d7 0.2\u00b0) spatial resolution, 8-day temporal resolution, Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), and 1985~current temporal coverage (Vazquez et al., 1998) .",
    "The JES subset data comprise 3116 seagrid points and 824 samples after masking land-grid points.",
    "The reconstructed JES SSTA data are analyzed using the CEOF analysis.",
    "This is done using scatter diagrams between the two normalized time series (Wilks, 1995) .",
    "These distributions of spatial amplitudes using the AVHRR dataset reveal much detail about features that cannot be captured by other widely-used SST datasets.",
    "Thus, three datasets are available: raw dataset with missing records, interpolated dataset for the missing records (calculated by the iterative EOF method), and the reconstructed dataset which is the combination of the raw and interpolated data.",
    "The causes of the interannual variability of JES SSTA have been investigated using correlation analysis between the n-th mode JES SSTA and background SLPA, SATA, SSTA, and four climate indices: AOI, NPI, MEI, and WPI.",
    "When the number of variables is large, geographic arrangement of data locations can be used to organize correlation information in map form.",
    "The zonal wind data were also from Climate Diagnostics Center derived NCEP Reanalysis Products with monthly interval and 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 spatial resolution over the common period.",
    "This correlation distribution might suggest that warm SAT over the Bering Sea and/or the subtropical to tropical central Pacific is accompanied by a cold anomaly of the first mode SSTA.",
    "Therefore, we examine the relationship of JES SSTA variability to the environmental variables representing these phenomena.",
    "(2004) identified interannual to interdecadal thermal variability of the JES upper layer (surface to 400 m deep) by analyzing a three-dimensional 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 gridded tem-perature dataset (1957~1996) using complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis with a high-pass filter of 7-year cut-off period.",
    "Subtraction of annual SST fields and 400-day moving-average were performed, and then the reconstructed SSTA dataset was established.",
    "Hence, the relationship of JES SSTA variability to the environment variables can be interpreted using the (lagged) correlation coefficient on an assumption of linearity.",
    "At the 95% significance level, the first two leading CEOFs are statistically significant and account for 86.0% of total variance on the time-scale longer than one year, with 66.4% for the first mode and 19.6% for the second mode.",
    "This correlation pattern consists of a positive correlation between AOI and the second mode SSTA (>0.5) at -2~0-year lag (Fig.",
    "We denote complex data field by T (x, y, t).",
    "This distribution of the high cores implies that the first EOF mode may explain SSTA variability of the central JES, including SPF.",
    "Section 3 discusses the temporal and spatial characteristics of the interannual variability and its propagation using CEOF analysis.",
    "Teleconnection of the Arctic Oscillation to the East Asian monsoon has been demonstrated by several studies (Gong et al., 2001; Ho, 2002, 2003; Wu and Wang, 2002) .",
    "(2000) reported that warm and cold eddies in YB and YR move southwestward with a speed of 0.01 m/s, based on a lag correlation analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON-ERS SSHA data.",
    "Figure 11 shows temporal variation of the second mode SSTA T 2 (x, y, t) from mid-1987 to mid-1993.",
    "Indeed, MEI is highly positively correlated to WPI at zero lag and seems to lead WPI slightly, by 1~2 months (not shown).",
    "Let [X(t), T(t)] be the time series of the environment variables and the n-th mode SSTA, respectively, which are normalized by their standard deviations.",
    "Figure 4 shows the time series of raw, interpolated, and reconstructed data for SST anomaly at 132.2\u00b0E and 35.8\u00b0N; here the anomaly was obtained by subtracting an annual cycle of SST.",
    "As mentioned in Subsection 2.3, the standard deviation of JES SST shows that JES is influenced by differential seasonal forcings.",
    "The patterns and causes of interannual variability of JES SST have been investigated using the CEOF analysis of the newly-reconstructed SST dataset (1985~2002) from the NOAA/AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder best SST data by iterative EOF analysis.",
    "Shortening of the temporal variability in the 1990s has also been discussed in earlier studies (Chu et al., 1998; Hirose and Ostrovskii, 2000; Morimoto and Yanagi, 2001; Minobe et al., 2004) .",
    "Lagged correlation coefficient (LCC) was used to investigate relationship between two variables.",
    "The background SATA is highly correlated to the first mode SSTA at -12-month to zero lag with the strongest correlation in the central JES exhibiting a similar pattern with spatial amplitude of the first mode SSTA (Fig.",
    "Most of the scatter diagrams reveal a robust or at least moderate linear relationship (not shown).",
    "We now call them the background anomaly data (SLPA, SATA, and SSTA).",
    "The root-mean-square (rms) error,\nis calculated between the interpolated (T i int ) and original (T i ori ) SST of the validation dataset (called the interpolation error) to evaluate the quality of data interpolation.",
    "Moreover, the strong correlation in the tropical to subtropical western Pacific of the background SATA and SSTA implies that cooling (warming) in the Subtropical Gyre is accompanied by cooling (warming) in the second mode of the southwestern (northeastern) JES.",
    "Three cold events (1986~1988, 1993, and 1996) and three warm events (1990~1991, 1994, and 1998~2002) can be identified either from the spatial-mean SSTA or the first mode SSTA.",
    "NOAA Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST data (Version 4.1) are used in constructing a new SST dataset (called the reconstructed SST data) for CEOF analysis.",
    "The maximum correlation coefficient is 0.93 and 0.84 for the first and second modes, respectively.",
    "(1998) suggested that JES SST varies with a period of 2~5 years, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) monthly SST on a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid during the period [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] .",
    "When the data field T(x, y, t) is expanded into Fourier series,\n, , cos , , sin , \nwhere [A n (x, y), \u03b8 n (x, y)] are amplitude and phase for S n (x, y), and [B n (t), \u03c6 n (t)] are amplitude and phase for PC n (t) (Venegas et al., 1998; Venegas, 2001) .",
    "The n-th mode SSTA is re-sampled in monthly interval to match its temporal resolution to the corresponding environment variables."
