    "(A paper presented at the Coriference in Gothenburg, Sweden, September 6-8, 1992.)",
    "A cross-country study of SSA, 29 for the period 1967-87, using an augmented production function framework and pooled time series and cross section data study found that differences in levels of or changes in openness accounted for significant differences in economic performance in terms of the level and growth of GDP.",
    "Nonetheless, recent studies have utilized improved analytical methods, measurement techniques and data to test the validity of these arguments.",
    "The volume data on total food imports for the same period shows a similar trend -down from 11.0 million tonv to 7.7 million tons.",
    "Helleiner 32' has analyzed the country-level data for twenty six SSA countries for the period 1980-90 to examine whether the tt-ms of trade losses suffered by these countries were offset by increased ODA.",
    "Its major findings can be summed up as follows:",
    "This is essentially an empirical question that was explored by Gersovitz and Paxon.2' They tested the relationship between the changes in the terms of trade and economic performance for twenty-four countries for the period 1974-83 but did not find any statistically significant relationship.",
    "The other study 28/ for a cross section of sixteen African countries (using period-average data) shows a strong positive relationship between export growth and GDP growth.",
    "Akiyam., T. and D. Larson.",

    "A sample survey of 27 adjusting low income countries in SSA for the period 1988-92 shows that capital goods and intermediate goods accounted for 67% of total impolts, fcod about 16%, fuel 4% and consumer goods only 13%.",
    "One study 27/ attempting to explain the GDP growth of SSA for the period 1970-86, shows that the strongest explanatory variable is the growth of export earnings; even when the import growth variable is introduced,the result is unchanged.",
    "Pickett 2' attempted to assess the effects on GDP growth of long-run terms of trade for a sample of twenty SSA low income countries over 1966-86.",
    "33 , The study showed that twelve of the 26 countries either enjoyed terms of trade improvements or ODA increases that more than compensated for terms of trade losses over the 1980s.",
    "Similar developments have been reported for other goods.",
    "Although there was a slight recovery in the period 1986-90, the overall ratio of 16 percent to 17 percent is much lower than the 25 percent average for developing countries as a group (Table VII) .",
    "Coleman, et al '\u00b0 have recently analyzed the impact of cocoa export increases in major Sub-Saharan producing countries, on world prices and production of cocoa using a large si-uiltaneous equation model of the world cocoa market consisting of three blocks: supply, demand and price determination.",
    "In this study, a normative '20 percent' debt servicing ratio was posited as the benchmark against which the debt relief resulting from zte application of each of the three proposals could be judged.",

    "Net ODA disbursements in real terms,which are used interchangeably in this paper as the indicator of aid flows, have grown at an annual rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990 for the developing countries as a whole.",
    "Akiyama and Larson 2' have empirically tested the valid of this argumnent by estimating the elasticity of export revenue (ERV) with respect to volume, which is the percentage change in export revenue when export quantity is increased by one percent.",
    "A study of sixteen SSA countries was carried out for the period 1980-90 to examine how adjustment has affected private investment in Africa.",
    "It also suggests that the type and terms of the new commitments of aid and loans are appropriate from the viewpoint of servicing future obligations and financing current import needs; the average grant element of all new long term commitments increased from less than 20 percent in the early 1980s to 50 percent by the end of the decade (if actual grants are included, the overall grant element of financial flows reached more than 70 percent for SSA).",
    "This, together with country specific evidence, undermines the traditional presumption that openness does not work in the SSA region.",

    "For example, between 1970s and 1980s, Africa's world market share for three main agricultural exports -coffee, cocoa and cotton -shrank by 22, 12 and 18 percent respectively.",

    "The volume, and timing may not have been perfect in each single case but their efforts need to be recognized.",
    "This paper attempts to bring together these three elements of the external sector ---trad&, aid and investment -and assess their effects on growth and sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "LI' The findings of this study suggest that determinants of private investment in SSA countries do not follow the same pattern as in other regions.",
    "coefficient estimates on openness) compare quite favorably with those for developing countries in other regions.",
    "The share of these 8/ El-Farhan's study also comes to similar conclusions.",
    "This conclusion is shared by the critics of structural adjustment such as Stewart, et al 25 who state that \"while industrial output grew at a rate comparable to that of other areas in the world before the 1980s, the pattern of industrialization vas, for the most part, inefficient by every measure, highly protected, highly import-dependent, with very few linkages with the rest of the economy and associated with very low levels of export\".",
    "Several African countries are distinguished from those in other regions of the world by the fact that three commodities of which Africa is a major exporter --Coffee, Cocoa and Copper--were severely depressed over the decade of the 1980s and their real prices had dropped to their historically low levels (although copper prices had rebounded in the later half of the decade).",
    "A survey of the literature reveals that several factors influence private investment.",
    "A recent survey 43, for example, concluded that the ability of countries to attract investment in manufacturing on the basis of the availability of cheap, unskilled labor has diminished in recent years.",

    "By 1992, the region accounted for 48 percent of IDA's worldwide net disbursements compared with just 31 percent as recently as 1985.As a result of the large increase in IDA disbursements,net flows from the World Bank to SSA grew from $1.3 billion a year in 1985 to $2 billion in 1992.",
    "This inference is strengthened by the results of recent cross-country analysis iinking openness with GDP growth.",
    "If \"deindustrialization\" is in fact resulting as a consequence of structural adjustment, this can be observed by comparing the changes in the share of industrial value-added in GDP before and after adjustment and examining the growth rates.",
    "For SSA, as a whole, including oil exporters, the total volume of exports declined on average, by about 0.7 percent a year in the 1980s."
