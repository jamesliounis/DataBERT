  "shortlist": [
    "As discussed inDas et al.",
    "The model is based on Das and others (2004a) .",
    "This paper suggests that the external validity of the experiment may be compromised due to this important source of heterogeneity-an empirical implication is to try and capture information on this and other changes that have occurred during the year of the experiment.",
    "What are the implications of this finding?",
    "Tables 8a and 8b replicate the specifications reported in tables 5a and 5b; in addition, we include an additional specification for the full sample where we interact a dummy variable for whether the student was a non-mover with the head-teacher report of absence.",
    "Closer to the results presented here are the studies by Jacobson (1989) and Ehrenberg and others (1991) .",
    "To derive an empirical specification, as in Das and others (2004) , the following assumptions are required.",
    "The educational environment is discussed in some detail in Das and others (2004a) and Das and others (2004b) .",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "This user-cost, evaluated at period t is (see Das and others (2004a)):",
    "This requires data that matches specific students and teachers, a requirement that is hard to fulfill in most countries; Ehrenberg and others (1991) for instance use district level data, which could partially explain the lack of a relationship between teacher absence and student learning in their study.",
    "In a previous paper (Das and others 2004), we documented that educational funding is an important determinant of learning achievement.",
    "More traditional regression-based studies also validate this finding.",
    "To see how the theory is affected, seeDas et al.",
    "To estimate such persistent effects requires data from at least 3 points in time, and this is a hard requirement in low-income countries.",
    "Section 2 reviews the literature.",
    "Not surprisingly, teacher attrition has received a lot of attention, both in the popular press and in institutional reports (our data and that from the census of schools in 2002 corroborates the high rates of attrition (Das and others 2004b)).",
    "Nevertheless, these measures have been extensively used and validated in the literature on health and economic outcomes.",
    "The comparison between column 1 and column 5 (or column 2 and column 6) suggests that this change is due to a change in the sample rather than the inclusion of additional variables.",
    "Looking across from column 4 to column 7 (which all use the same restricted sample), the coefficients for English vary between -0.033 and -0.035 standard deviations, a variation of less than 10 percent.",
    "Our findings also raise a methodological issue.",
    "Table 7 reports results of a regression of baseline test scores on the number of days absent and teacher characteristics.",
    "Table 9 explores whether intrinsic differences in the sample account for our results, by excluding children with very different backgrounds from the nested specification.",
    "Papers using analysis of variance techniques have shown that the variation in test scores explained by teachers is substantial.",
    "Evidence either way would be helpful.",
    "Columns 1 and 2, and 5 and 6 report coefficients for the full sample, while the other columns report results for the non-mover sample.",
    "To the extent that such records are available, they tend to under-estimate absence by 5-10 percent (Chaudhury and others 2004).",
    "Appendix 1 provides a discussion of these alternative measures.Despite the measurement error associated with a 30-day recall period as a measure of year-long shocks, there are established precedents in household surveys.",
    "Returning to tables 5a and 5b, tests for the joint significance of teacher characteristics report F-statistics in the range of 0.06 (English) and 0.72 (Mathematics), both of which are insignificant at the 50-percent level of confidence.",
    "Section 4 presents the empirical specification and econometric concerns.",
    "The empirical results are based on a rich teacher-student matched data set from Zambia that we collected in 2002.",
    "Tables 5a and 5b report coefficients based on four different specifications for English and Mathematics.",
    "Differencing across the base and final year, the estimated change in \"knowledge\" is used as the dependent variable in our regressions (see Das and others 2004a for details).",
    "Continuing in the same vein, table 6 computes a two-way contingency table, where the columns are teachers who were more or less absent and the rows are students who were more or less absent.",
    "Moreover, in the nested specification, the coefficient and significance for the non-movers sample is identical to that reported before.",
    "It is also robust to a number of identification problems common to estimating the impact of school inputs on learning, which we discuss below.",
    "Parallel work on the contribution of households focus on how household-level shocks affect educational attainment (two examples are Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; de Janvry and others 2005).",
    "Columns 5-7 reproduce the results of columns 1-3, but estimated on this reduced sample.",
    "That is, we can check whether among the movers, positive movements were correlated with higher absence reports.",
    "We then look only at the area of \"common support\", that is, we only keep in the sample those children whose predicted probabilities are found in both the sample of movers and the sample of children with same-teachers.",
    "In light of the above, our empirical specification is given by:",
    "For instance we can check for a selection effect in the self-reported measure (we don't have a report for those who were absent on the day) by comparing the reports of the head-teacher for the sample who were present on the day of the survey and those who were not.",
    "We first estimate the probability that a student is a mover based on household, teacher and school characteristics and use this regression to predict the probability of moving.",
    "In Column 1, we include a variable for the number of days absent in the last month reported by the head-teacher and a dummy for whether the school is in a rural location.",
    "We continue to impose (as in Das and others (2004a) ) the following assumptions:",
    "The word processed describes informally produced works that may not be commonly available through library systems.",
    "Subsequent specifications introduce additional controls: Column 2 reports the estimated coefficient including school characteristics, column 3 introduces teacher characteristics and column 4 includes student characteristics.",
    "13 Table 1 summarizes the school, teacher and student samples.",
    "For the sample of movers, an additional source of bias is introduced through selective matching.",
    "However, our sample of non-movers is different from the movers (see table 3): since the policy of teachers remaining with the same cohort of students was implemented in larger schools, the non-movers tend to be concentrated in urban areas and come from households that are one-third of a standard deviation richer on average."
