    "The consolidation of all of the available data on the income and expenditure (and net operating profits) of the various components of the public sector showed us that, even excluding complete data on the state-owned enterprises, fiscal deficits in Ghana over the past two decades have been significant.",
    "We first consider in detail the data that are available for Ghana and construct a measure of the consolidated public sector deficit from the income and expenditure accounts of the government.",
    "These functions were estimated for the 1970/71-1988 period; the results are set out in Table 2 .4.",

    "The model used is a simple version of that proposed in Appendix II of Easterly et al (1989) and is based on the \"public finance approach to inflation\" literature discussed above.",
    "Any study that aims to understand the macroeconomy by examining the data available must take the parallel economy and the effect of the black market premium on macroeconomic variables into account.",
    "The authors also find that high levels of ized.",
    "z. general, the most reliable data sources available were used, but there is no guarantee that the measurement of any given variable was consistent over time.",

    "Very little data is available 10 Note that the data presented on the central government exclude capital expenditure financed through external project aid and the corresponding grants and loans.",
    "We find public investment, corporate tax revenues, and the liquidity constraint variable to be statistically significant.",
    "Since the data for privately held foreign assets must be subject to a great deal of measurement error, a proxy variable was initially estimated and used in the regressions.",
    "There was a dual exchange rate system with some transactions covered under the fixed rate system and others by the exchange This section of the study tries to explain the stylized facts presented above in the context of a model which takes into 47This systam was meant to reduce the spread between the official and parallel market rates, and actually achieved this.",
    "The measures of the deficit discussed to this point have largely been pragmatic ones in that they provide measures that are for the most part practicable given the average level of data availability.",

    "The results are: Y is now significant at a higher level whereas X is no longer as significant as in the previous equation.",
    "For the other parts of the study we use the conventional measure of the consolidated fiscal deficit as set out in section 1 above.",
    "one might argue therefore that the model and analysis in this section of the paper is not useful for analyzing the possible effects of future government policy.",
