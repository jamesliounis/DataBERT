    "This paper-a product of the Financial Sector Development Department-is part of a larger effort in the department to study the promotion of pension funds.",
    "The author may be contacted at dvittas@worldbank.org.",
    "As '9 The empirical evidence has been compiled by Gregorio Impavido and Alberto Musalem in a series of papers (Catalan et 2001, Impavido and Musalem 2000) .",
    "Copies of the paper are available free from the World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington, DC 20433.",
    "Available data show that pension funds in countries that rely on the \"prudent expert\" approach have been able to achieve higher investment returns than pension funds in countries that have imposed quantitative limits on different classes of assets (Davis 1998 , European Commission 1999 .",
    "The paper is organized around ten basic questions regarding the promotion of funded pillars and policies to promote saving for retirement.",
    "The paper highlights the differences in approach around the world, belying any claims of uniform solutions (Orszag and Stiglitz 2001) .",
    "The argument in favor of multi-pillar structures that underlies the approach of this paper is the premnise that the evaluation of the merits and demerits of different pension pillars suffers from what may be called \"empirical agnosia\".",
    "This can be reduced by using properly diversified portfolios and more sophisticated annuity products (Bodie and Crane 1998 , Burtless 1998 , Alier and Vittas 2001 .",
    "Given the long span of pension contracts, one would need data covering much more than one hundred years to be able to assess the relative merits of each pillar.",
    "The remainder of the paper then focuses on the different ways in which funded pillars can be organized.",
    "Centralized collection of contributions has been pursued in a number of countries, but the results have been less than satisfactory, most notably in Kazakhstan and",
    "This is a useful simplified key, although it should be borne in mind that the relationship between collection and asset fees is nonlinear.",
    "As a result, it is not surprising that the UK financial system has suffered from many scandals, including the BCCI collapse, the Maxwell case, the Lloyds insurance market abuses, the mis-selling of personal pension plans, and the fiasco of Equitable Life.",
    "In the two countries mentioned, contributions were collected but individual records were deficient so that a substantial proportion of collected funds remained unallocated two years or more after the introduction of the new system.",
    "The World Bank publicized the benefits of multi-pillar pension systems for developing countries in the 1990s both through the publication and dissemination of a policy research report (World Bank 1994) and through its operational work around the world (Holzmann 2000) .",
    "Most of these reforms have been in the direction of multi-pillar systems, the advantages of which were first articulated by Swiss experts in the early 1960s (Helbling 1991) .",
    "Other benefits for active workers could include provisions allowing pre-retirement withdrawals for housing, education, health care and various emergencies (e.g., funeral or wedding '0 These structural problems include the impact of adverse selection due to asymmetric information and socioeconomic factors (Friedman and Warshawsky 1990 , Blake 1999 , Brown 1999 , James and Vittas 2000 .",
    "Whether people (or at least a substantial proportion) are \"myopic\" in their saving behavior should be empirically verifiable, but in fact there are no hard data to support or reject such assertions.",
    "Most of the discussion covers the accumulation phase of pension systems, although some reference is made to the problems that are likely to be faced during the decumulation phase.",
    "For a contribution period that covers the last 30 years before retirement, the simplified key is 7 basis points, while for a contribution period covering the last invest more heavily in corporate equities and bonds (Rocha et al 2001) .",
    "Singapore) and still others with a T regime (e.g.",
    "Thus, in the unlikely event that they became available, long-term data would be very difficult to interpret.",
    "This approach was formally introduced in Switzerland in 2000, although it was practiced informally over a longer period.",
    "The main focus of this paper is the promotion, organization and regulation of funded pillars.",
    "The best example is Switzerland, which specifies the obligatory part of its funded pillar as a definedcredit system' with the ultimate objective to achieve a targeted pension level at retirement (Smalhout 1996, Queisser and Vittas 2000) .",
    "Multi-pillar structures have long characterized some of the more advanced OECD countries, especially Switzerland and the Netherlands in Continental Europe and most Anglo-American countries around the world.",
    "There are currently proposals under discussion for a significant decrease in its level to reflect the fall in interest rates and the increase in longevity.",
    "Although pension funds are neither necessary nor sufficient for capital market development (Vittas 2000) , there is nevertheless considerable empirical evidence showing a close correlation between pension funds ('and other institutional investors) and capital market development\".",
    "Such an approach is successfully applied in the case of the Thrift Savings Plan for the Federal Employees Retirement System in the United States.",
    "Various guarantees covering aspects such as performance.",
    "employment with the same employer, and on the treatment of pre-and post-retirement inflation (Bodie and Merton 1992) .",
    "There may be some practical problems in defining benchmark portfolios, although these difficulties should not be exaggerated since benchmarks are widely used by pension funds to monitor the performance of asset managers.",

    "The cost of transition, the demographic structure of a country, the state of development of its financial markets, and the political acceptability of pension reform all are important variables that must be, and are, taken into account in shaping pension reform programs.",
    "The minimum out much more clearly and also include the decumulation phase (a fixed minimum annuity conversion factor is specified).",
    "This paper does not re-examine the case for a multi-pillar structure and does not focus on the relative importance of different pillars.",
    "What is important is to seek arrangements that minimize the costs of both pillars while promoting higher efficiency.",
    "This trend is more prevalent in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but it is also quite pronounced in Switzerland and the United States and is spreading in other countries with large occupational pension plans (such as Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).",
    "The Dutch approach makes more sense than the Danish approach, although it faces the difficulty of identifying the level of overfunding, which can be quite controversial in defined-benefit plans.",

    "To some extent, this pattern is explained by the matching contribution made by employers, which is often made in company stock rather than cash.",
    "The minimum return is credited alongside the required age-related contributions.",
    "pattern, exemplified by the high operating efficiency of the Central Provident Fund of Singapore and the Employees' Provident Fund of Malaysia, serve to confirm this rule.",
    "care must be taken to address effectively the risk of The author focuses mainly on the promotion, moral hazard.",
    "The financial pressures caused by demographic aging are often used as an argument for moving from unfunded to funded pension systems.",
    "This paper argues for imposing compulsory participation on workers in dependent employment but exempting the very young (under 25), the very old (over the normal retirement age), the very poor (those eaming less than 40 percent of the average wage) and the selfemployed.",
    "In the absence of hard facts, one falls back on intuition and inference from observed behavior.",
    "This may explain the high ratio of contributors to affiliates, which exceeds 75 percent in Mexico against less than 50 percent in Argentina and Chile.",
    "This is a simple yet comprehensive statement that also covers social equity and redistributive issues since pension benefits cannot be considered adequate if they fail to address the subsistence needs of pensioners."
