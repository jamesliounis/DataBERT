    "For further description and discussion of the data sources and estimation methods are discussed in Chen and Ravallion (2004) , which is the source of this figure.",
    "An important new source of information on socioeconomic differences in health indicators has been developed by Gwatkin et al., (2000) , based on the Demographic and Health 4",
    "However, it is not difficult to do so for the purpose of this paper.",
    "Recognizing the aforementioned data problems in studying the socioeconomic differences in social indicators, Bidani and Ravallion (1997) use an indirect method of inferring the conditional means from cross-country (or cross-regional) aggregates.",
    "Vital registration systems are weak in many developing countries though censuses and surveys have provided some useful validation data.)",
    "Focusing only on the 18 observations for SSA, the birth rate for the poor is 46.9 (standard error of 4.1) versus 31.4 (2.7) for the non-poor, implying BRD=1.2 (the same as from the DHS).",
    "Since Africa will be prominent in later results in this paper, it is worth exploring further why one finds a low DRD for this region using the BR method.",
    "Starting again with mortality, Table 1 gives the implied impacts ( DRD.",
    "14 The same analyses of the DHS data summarized above provide estimates of the differentials in fertility rates.",
    "The implied values of DRD for each age group are 1.8, 1.6, 1.2 and 1.0 respectively.",
    "gives us an estimate of the contribution of the demographic changes during that period.",
    "developing and transition countries; the data are reported in World Bank (2004) (though I supplemented this source with data from PovcalNet).",
    "aggregate time series or cross-sectional regressions have the potential to reveal the more subtle indirect effects of demographic change, this approach brings its own problems.",
    "Indeed, if one just focuses on the 18 observations in this data set for SSA then one finds no correlation between death rates and the incidence of poverty.",
    "This follows a method outlined in Gwatkin et al.",
    "In a meta-study of all the cross-country growth regressions with an average of seven regressors (chosen from 67 candidates drawn from the literature on cross-country growth regressions) Sala-I-Martin et al (2004) report that the rate of population growth is only significant in one fifth of cases.",
    "In standard statistical sources, the CDR is measured as the number of deaths in the last year relative to mid-year population.",
    "Schultz (2004) raises a number of concerns about the robustness of the existing cross-country evidence on the demographic determinants of aggregate savings.",
    "11 The implied value of DRD is 2.2.",
    "while that for the non-poor is 16.2 (standard error of 1.7); the implied DRD is slightly over 1.1.",
    "Figure 2 gives a scatter plot of the CDR for 2002 against the latest Chen-Ravallion \"$1 a day\" poverty rates across the 83 9 Significant income effects on mortality arising from higher prices for foodstaples in Matlab thana are also reported by Ravallion (1987) .",
    "Similarly to the death rate, we know less about the conditional mean birth rates, though recent analyses of DHS data have provided some valuable new information.",
    "(These data should not be considered very reliable.",
    "(Note that the TFR is obtained by aggregating the age specific fertility rates by year for women 15-49 years.)",
    "Again, the impacts are large in South Asia and (especially) Africa, though evidence presented in Section 3 suggests that we should probably be using a lower value of BRD for both these regions, at around 1.2.",
    "However, his methodology does not allow one to calculate the DRD.8 I know of one large sample survey (in the field at the time of writing) that did collect recall data on mortality for both children and adults, namely the Malawi Integrated Household Survey.",
    "Given the data problems noted in the last section, it would be unwise to insist on a single point estimate of either the DRD or BRD.",
    "At the same time, the results point to the need for better data on socio-economic differentials in mortality and fertility, and for further research on the social and economic processes linking demographic changes to the evolution of poverty measures.",
    "Finally, Table 3 gives the analogous results for the natural rate of population increase (CBR-CDR).",
    "Estimates with more comprehensive coverage are provided by Gwatkin (2000) , who reports death rates by age group for the poorest 20% of the population of the developing world.",
    "Furthermore, recent research (reviewed later) points to significant socioeconomic differentials in mortality and fertility; in particular, both birth rates and death rates tend to be higher for the poor.",
    "Table 1 also gives a regional breakdown of the estimated impacts of differential mortality on the 2001 headcount index.",
    "An instructive exception is for the United States, where the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) surveyed over one million adults from multiple waves of the Current Populations Surveys, thus allowing mortality data to be linked directly to socio-economic data including incomes.",
    "Then Section 3 reviews existing evidence on differential mortality and fertility, and presents some new evidence.",
    "This section reviews existing evidence on relevant socioeconomic differentials in mortality and fertility.",
    "The Table 1 also gives the impacts expressed as a percentage of the annual rates of poverty reduction from 1990 to 2001.",
    "10 The poverty rate is the most recent estimate provided it is no earlier than 1995 (the median survey year is 1999), though the poverty data predate the death rate data.",
    "Following this approach, Kelley and Schmidt (2001) and Williamson (2001) present evidence of adverse effects of high population growth rates on rates of economic growth; Williamson argues that the key demographic variable is the growth rate of the dependent population.",
    "(1999) in which the country is the unit of observation for income and death rates.",
    "(The estimates implied by the BR method are 19.3 for the poor, with a standard error of 7.1, and 17.1 for the non-poor, with a standard error of 1.56; the difference is not significant; t-statistic=0.6.)",
    "2 As this paper will show, the contribution of demographic changes to aggregate poverty measures is non-parametrically identified.",
    "Though incomes are not available, Hurt et al., (2004) report death rates among those with no education that are about double those found for people with five or more years of formal education.",
    "(Notice that the correlation with poverty is stronger for the birth rate; the simple correlation coefficient is 0.77, versus 0.51 for the death rates in Figure 2 .)",
    "An econometricdecomposition method on cross-country data is used to estimate the differences in various social indicators between the poor and non-poor; hereafter this is termed the BR method.",
    "The following analysis is built on the most widely used measure of poverty, namely the headcount index given by the proportion of the population living in households with real consumption or income per person below a predetermined poverty line.",
    "But even focusing on DRD=1.2, it is clear that the impacts are highest for Sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "Eastwood and Lipton (1999, 2001 ) use instead changes over time in poverty measures as their dependent variable, for a cross-section of countries, and find evidence of adverse effects of higher fertility on measures of poverty; they find that these effects are transmitted thought both growth and distribution.",
    "The calculations assume that BRD=DRD.",
    "The impacts of differential (non-random) deaths and births in the period of length \u03c4 prior to the date in question are then:",
    "As we will see, even this conceptually straightforward approach faces some severe data limitations, which generate considerable uncertainty about the poverty impacts of demographic change."
