    "In this paper, I set out some practical diagnostic tests of the efficiency of (implicit) transport policies emboJied in state marketing and their implications for infrastructural investment, tests that can be calculated using data that are readily available in many African countries and for many crops.",
    "The study assesses the effects of panterritorial pricing empirically, on the data of one country, the Cote d'Ivoire and one of its chief export crops, cotton.",
    "As can be seen from the data in Tables 1 and 2 , this condition is easily met for all zones, with p -c = 350 CFA francs and the largest value of a't 1 being 76.3 CFA francs.",
    "For instance, for the example given in Table 1 , col. 5, the summary statistics 6 That is, the difference in II between cols.",
    "' For my information on the CIDT, I rely onBeenhakker and Bruzelius (1985),DCGT (1986 and, and CIDT(various years).2 The approach that I use builC3 on the work byWalters (1968) on the Ellet model.Gersovitz (1989) applies this framework to some topics in optimal taxation and agricultural marketing.",
    "The result corresponding to Table 4 , cols.",
    "Table 5 , col. 2 provides the mean number of months after October 1 until the cotton is purchased by the CIDT, by zone, as well as statistics on this variable.",

    "In the case of cotton in the Cote d'lvoire, values for the variatles that vary by zone, their means, standard deviations, ininma and maxima, along with a list of the zones, are given in Table 1 .",
    "Calculations are discussed in the text.",
    "This research was supported by the World Bank under RPO 674-75 and by a grant from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation to the Research Program in Development Studies at Princeton University.",
    "1 and 2.5 In Table 3 , a comparison between the gains in producers' surplus from a S Col. 4 of Table 3 is derived by finding numerically the p 1 that solves the (non-linear) equation:",
    "For instance, the minimum total lag in evacuationi (col.2 -col.",
    "Thus while farmers harvest seed cotton and sell it to the CIDT for processing at the ginneries, I measure their output in the modeling exercise as y, =0.419 times their actual output of seed cotton (as given in col. 1 of Table 1) .",
    "In simulations corresponding to those reported in Tables 3 and  4 , I doubled a' to 0.134.",
    "Combining Cote d'Ivoire data (available at the level of 56 zones) with different values of the elasticity of supply, it appears that: a.",
    "It is the purpose of this paper to see what can be learned about rural transport from the study of zonal data.",
    "In the case of African countries, information with which to study the effect of transport policy on agricultural response at the farm level is largely unavailable, either because it has not been collected or because governments treat it as confidential.",
    "As for the price variables, the numbers used in the base case are given in Table 2 and refer to 1982/83.",
    "The correlation between this measure of delay and the distance of the zone from the ginnery is -0.50 with an extremely high statistical significance of 0.0001.",
    "These relations, illustrated numerically from Cote d'Ivoire data, dictate questions tiat ought to be asked in evaluating agricultural transport projects and, equally, in reviews of agricultural pricing or agricultural tax schemes.",
    "where for each block of Tables 3 and 4 .",
    "Tables 3 and 4 provide information to assess the benefits from investments in transport infrastructure as represented by a decrease in the cost per ton-mile, a.",
    "In practice, whether one emphasizes changes in the intensive or extensive margins of cultivation in an analysis of agricultural response to transport policy depends partially on the degree of aggregation in the information that is available.",
    "The research investigates the efficiency and the consequences of different systems of these implicit incentives.",
    "Nonetheless, some examples suggest what to look for and what to expect from different schemes tllat may be encountered in practice.",
    "For it to matter significantly, however, the government must be raising more revenue than seems to have been its practice, for example, Table 4 , cols.",
    "The significance of the research for operations is to demonstrate the interdependence of' If the state taxes the crop, the bcst policy is agricuiturai pricing poiicy and inarceLting 4o0aid",
    "For operational purposes, the significance of the study is to clarify the relation that exists between different marketing board pricing systems and the method of implementing the schemes on the one hand, and, on the other, the implicit incentives for transport use, producer surplus and returns to transport investments.",
    "Thus these two measures of the delay in harvest evacuation actually engendered by the CIDT are negatively related to distance while the considerations stressed in Table 6 and the accompanying discussion suggest that it is optimal that these correlations be positive.",

    "A correlation of this variable with the distance from the ginnery or either of the delay-in-evacuation variables produced entirely statistically insignificant results (0.55, 0.34 and 0.45 levels of significance, respectively), indicating no relationship between these variables.",
    "Similarly, t, is given as follows: (1) divide col. 2 of Table 1 by 0.419; (2) multiply col. 3 of Table I by 0.26 and divide by 0.067 to account for the differences in costs per km per ginned cotton equivalent from the depot to the ginnery and from the ginnery to the port (see Table 2 on a'); (3) add the outcomes from the preceding two steps to get an adjusted tj.",
    "While it is very difficuilt to measure all the costs and benefits of the CIDT's policy on sequencing, the CIDT does publish the proportion of cotton of first quality by zone ( Table 5 , col. 3).",

    "It proposes diagnostic tests that can be app!ied (or diagnostic questions that should be asked) to arrive at reasonably strong presumptions about the optimality or otherwise of existing arrangements in the pricing of transport, the distribution of depots and the logistics of crop evacuation, and thus of the rationality of arguments for public expenditures on transport that arise in given circumstances.",
    "The next section presents a conceptual framework for looking at rural transport and state marketing, 2 and uses it to organize some basic facts about the operations of the CIDT.",
    "The study therefore states certain optimality rules.",
    "The same procedure is followed to compute cols.",
    "Again, the correlation between this measure of delay and distance from the ginnery is negative, -0.26, although with a reduced significance level of 0.06.",
    "For practical reasons, therefore, the study of rural transport is largely restricted to data reported at a geographical level just below that of the region in which production occurs (termed zones productrices in the case of the CIDT) or to special studies of particular road projects.",
    "For this value of at, the movement to revenue maximization (Table 4 , col. 1) brings a relatively small increase in revenue from the current situation (Table 3 , col. 1), but a relatively large decrease in producer surplus and a relatively large potential gain in producers' surplus from optimal pricing (Table 4, col. 2).",
