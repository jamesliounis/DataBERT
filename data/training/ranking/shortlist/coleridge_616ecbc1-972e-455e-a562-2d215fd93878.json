    "Details of the statistical significance for each variable are given in Table 2 .",
    "An analysis using the data relating to how long the students had been playing revealed a multiple R of .593 with an adjusted R 2 of .34 (F(2,112) = 30.37, p < ,0001).",
    "Table 2 provides details of the levels of statistical significance for each predictor.",
    "Both were highly statistically significant (p < .0001) (see Table 3 for details).",
    "These differences were statistically significant (see Table 1 for details).",
    "These differences were statistically significant (see Table 1 ).",
    "The findings are presented in terms of English, mathematics and overall attainment.",
    "Hoffman (1995) , Wallick (1998) , and Barr et al.",
    "This revealed a multiple R of .64 with an adjusted R 2 of .41 (F[3,603] = 140.31, p < .0001).",
    "This revealed a multiple R of .6 with an adjusted R 2 of .36 (F[3,603] = 113.18, p < .0001).",
    "This revealed a multiple R of .31 with an adjusted R 2 of 0.71 (F(3,111) = 3.89, p < .011).",
    "Analysis of variance showed that there were statistically significant differences in performance between the non-instrumentalists and instrumentalists at Key Stage 2 (age 11) (see Table 1 for details).",
    "Miksza (2007) , using data from National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 with a sample of 5335, created a composite item which assessed student participation in music for the entire duration of the study from eighth to 12 th grade and measured academic achievement in mathematics, reading comprehension, science and social studies.",
    "The findings are considered in relation to the possible reasons for this, and the implications for education.",
    "The research reported here adds to that evidence, although it is limited in scope and the number of variables which were able to be taken into account.",
    "There were statistically significant differences between the instrumentalists and noninstrumentalists in their performance in mathematics at KS2 (F(1,605) = 16.68, p < .0001).",
    "This study draws on existing data from three secondary schools in a large English Local Authority.",
    "A multiple R of .55 was revealed with an adjusted R 2 of .29 (F(2.112) = 24.27, p < .0001).",
    "These differences were all highly significant statistically (see Table 1 ).",
    "The multiple R was .4 with an adjusted R 2 of .157 (F(3,603) = 38.59, p < .0001).",
    "These findings were highly statistically significant and suggest that length of time learning to play an instrument is a better predictor of average points score at KS4 than English level at KS2 and is almost as good as mathematics at KS2 (for further details see Table 3) .",
    "The standardized beta weights were .522 for KS2 English score (p < .0001) and .225 for how long the students had been playing .225 (p < .01) (see Table 3 for details).",
    "A multiple regression to establish the extent of the impact of playing an instrument on attainment revealed a multiple R of .71 with an adjusted R 2 of .5 (F (2,599) = 300.93, p < .0001).",
    "A multiple R of .68 was obtained with an adjusted R 2 of .46 (F(2,604) = 259.04, p < .0001).",
    "The database includes a detailed assessment of the intensity and duration of music activities for representative youth cohorts, and a variety of outcomes including school results.",
    "Data on progress between KS2 and KS4 were also collected.",
    "The standardized beta coefficients were .47 for KS2 mathematics and .27 for length of time playing an instrument (see Table 3 for details).",
    "The information on national tests and examinations in English and mathematics was provided by data managers in each school.",
    "Also in the USA, Southgate and Roscigno (2009) -using two national data sets, ECLS-K (20,000 US kindergarten students) and NELS:88 (25,000 adolescents), and three measures of music participation (in school, outside school and parental involvement in the form of concert attendance) -found that music involvement varied systematically by class and gender status.",
    "In a later study Miszka (2010) using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, taking account of a wider range of variables studied the impact of musical engagement on standardized mathematics scores and found that students in high-school music ensembles were more likely to have higher standardised mathematics achievement scores.",
    "The mean for the instrumentalists learning for 2/3 years was 29.29 (SD = 4.24) and for those learning 4/5 years 30.45 (SD = 5.15).",
    "Correlation studies have explored the relationships between active music making and enhanced executive functioning with largely positive results although there are some exceptions (see Hallam, 2015 for a review).",
    "There was a statistically significant difference between instrumentalists and non-instrumentalists in relation to the number of KS4 examinations taken with the instrumentalists taking 11.38 (SD = 1.88) and the non-instrumentalists 10.1(2.19).",
    "Analyses were also undertaken in relation to the length of time that the students had been learning.",
    "The findings support the international evidence where correlation studies have suggested that children who experience musical training have advantages across all school subjects except sport even after general intelligence is controlled for (Wetter, Koerner & Schwaninger, 2009 ).",
    "A multiple regression analysis was undertaken on the total points score for all qualifying examinations using KS2 mathematics and English scores and playing an instrument or not as predictors.",
    "A multiple regression was carried out on the total number of points from student's best eight examination scores at the end of KS4 with KS2 mathematics and English and playing an instrument or not as predictors.",
    "The mean for the instrumentalists for the average KS4 points score was 48.48 (SD = 5.37), total points for all KS4 examinations 551.6 (SD = 125.1) and capped score for the best eight examinations 400.76 (SD = 48.46).",
    "(2002) indicated a positive effect in some subject areas as did Cabanac et al.",
    "This study addresses this drawing on data on attainment at age 11 and 16 relating to 608 students, 115 of whom played a musical instrument.",
    "The mean for progress for those learning 2/3 years was 3.47 (SD = .69) and for those learning for 4/5 years 3.77 (SD = .65) and for performance at KS4 for the those learning 2/3 years 45.09 (SD = 6.37) and those 4/5 years 48.6 (SD = 5.34) (see Table 2 for details).",
    "The trends observed in relation to English and mathematics was also seen in relation to overall attainment.",
    "While KS2 attainment in mathematics and English were slightly better predictors of total points score than playing an instrument, the latter nevertheless made a highly statistically significant contribution (see Table 3 for details).",
    "The group learning for 2/3 years had a mean of 3.55 (SD = .89) in relation to progress while the group learning for 4/5 years had a mean of 4.1 (SD = 79).",
    "A multiple regression on the average points score for all qualifying examinations taken at KS4 with KS2 mathematics and English scores and playing an instrument or not as the predictors revealed a multiple R of .69 with an adjusted R 2 of .48 (F(3,603) = 186.99, p < .0001).",
    "This included the number of subjects taken, the average point score obtained, the total score point obtained, and the capped score obtained when performance in the best eight subjects was taken into account.",
    "In a review of El Sistema and Sistema inspired projects, Creech et al.",
    "While playing an instrument made a lesser contribution than KS2 performance it was still highly statistically significant.",
    "In relation to performance at KS4 the young people learning for 2/3 years had a mean of 46.04 (SD = 7.36) while those learning for 4/5 years had a mean of 50.2 (SD = 6.84) (see Table 2 for details).",
    "However, there were statistically significant differences in progress to KS4 and performance at KS4."
