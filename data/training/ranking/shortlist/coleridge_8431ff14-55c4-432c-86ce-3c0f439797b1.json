    "Methods: Review of the literature.",
    "SO participated in literature review and in writing the first draft of the manuscript.",
    "Adapted with permission from Lupien et al.",
    "et al., 2008; Ouanes et al., 2017a; Sang et al., 2018) .",

    "A prospective study by Ennis et al.",
    "JP participated in literature review and revised the article.",
    "et al., 2008; Beluche et al., 2010; Geerlings et al., 2015) , other studies failed to find such an association (Ouanes et al., 2017a,b; Echouffo-Tcheugui et al., 2018) .",
    "In fact, in a study by Geerlings et al.",
    "(Kim and Feldman, 2015; Martocchia et al., 2016) .",
    "Yet, some studies, conversely, showed decreased cortisol following stressful life events (Miller et al., 2007; Daskalakis et al., 2013) .",
    "In a cross-sectional study examining the links between cardiovascular risk factors and A\u03b2 brain burden as determined by Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), an association has been found between plasma cortisol and A\u03b2 brain burden (Toledo et al., 2012) .",
    "In other studies, OSA has been associated with increased nocturnal plasma cortisol levels (Chopra et al., 2017) .",
    "(2010) ; however, this finding was not replicated in other studies (Saigh et al., 2006) .",
    "et al., 2008 ) studies exploring the relationship between episodic memory and cortisol levels have found an association between elevated cortisol and poorer episodic memory among older adults without dementia.",
    "While some of these effects are acute (Lupien and McEwen, 1997; Lupien et al., 2002; Meir Drexler and Wolf, 2016) , some appear to be long-lasting and may even involve long-term changes in the brain structure (Geerlings et al., 2015) .",
    "PTSD has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of dementia in both genders over an average of 8 years of follow-up (hazard ratio: 1.73[1.47, 2.02]) (Flatt et al., 2017) .",
    "In a study of the same research group, involving 456 elderly non-demented subjects, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been found to be linked to cognitive impairment, but the relationship did not appear to be mediated by diurnal cortisol levels (HabaRubio et al., 2018) .",
    "On the other hand, other studies failed to find any association between stressful life events and cognitive performance in the elderly (Ward et al., 2007; Fountoulakis et al., 2011; Sundstrom et al., 2014 ) and some even showed a possible improvement in cognition following certain stressful events (Deeg et al., 2005) .",
    "On the one hand, several studies highlighted associations between stressful events and poorer subsequent cognitive performance, in particular in memory and executive functions (Xavier et al., 2002; VonDras et al., 2005; van Gelder et al., 2006; Lupien et al., 2007) above and beyond the impact of depression (Comijs et al., 2011) .",
    "In the same study, increased cortisol levels were associated with some microstructural changes, specifically in the corpus callosum and the posterior corona radiate (EchouffoTcheugui et al., 2018) .",
    "The differences in populations, assessment tools, as well as the likely effects of possible confounding factors including age, gender, educational level, as well as other neuroendocrine and psychological factors might explain these discrepancies.",
    "However, remission appeared to moderate the association between cortisol slope defined by the difference between maximal and minimal cortisol levels during the nyctemera, and certain cognitive tasks assessing processing speed and executive function (Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .",
    "(2015) involving 4244 non-demented subjects, elevated evening cortisol was found to be associated with decreased volumes in all brain regions, in particular the gray matter (Geerlings et al., 2015) .",
    "Similar findings have been reported in the dementia-free Framingham Heart Study participants: elevated cortisol was associated with decreased total brain volume, in particular decreased occipital and frontal gray matter volumes.",
    "One randomized controlled trial in a small sample of patients with mild to moderate AD dementia showed improvement of cognitive performance in memory tasks, but the premature termination did not allow any firm conclusions regarding efficacy (Pomara et al., 2002) .",
    "In a study in patients with AD dementia, plasma cortisol levels have been shown to reflect the degree of cognitive deficits in AD dementia rather than the severity of the comorbid depression (Zverova et al., 2013) .",
    "In the AGESReykjavik population-based study (Geerlings et al., 2017) , both current major depressive disorder and high evening cortisol levels were associated with an higher risk of incident AD and non-AD dementia, but cortisol did not seem to be a major factor explaining the relation between depression and risk of dementia.",
    "Indeed, corticosteroids have been associated with effects on mood, stress, anxiety, sleep, appetite, as well as cognition (Lupien et al., 2007; Wolkowitz et al., 2009; Copinschi and Caufriez, 2013) .",
    "Altogether, these data suggest that, mostly, cognitive deficits linked to increased cortisol and HPA axis dysregulation cannot be entirely explained by a co-occurring depressive disorder.",
    "The first part of the plot shows that memory performance increases as cortisol levels increase (due to the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors or MRs).",
    "FIGURE 1 | Dose-response relationship between the memory performance and the cortisol levels.",
    "Hence, elevated cortisol may lead, through its metabolic syndrome-associated effects on glucose, blood pressure and lipids, to an increased cardiovascular risk (Lattanzi and Silvestrini, 2017) .",
    "Further studies are needed to confirm the value of cortisol levels as a possible preclinical marker associated with higher risk, and/or as a prognostic parameter in subjects with clinical AD.",
    "However, other studies found no association (Adler et al., 1997; Schommer et al., 1999; Ferguson, 2008) , or even an opposite link (Ballenger et al., 1983; LeBlanc and Ducharme, 2005) .",
    "Similarly, Csernansky et al.",
    "Also, several non-pharmacological intervention in subjects with MCI (Baker et al., 2010) or dementia (Woods et al., 2009; Schaub et al., 2018) have shown cortisol lowering effects.",
    "These factors may include life events (Ouanes et al., 2017a) , personality (Ouanes et al., 2017b; Tautvydaite et al., 2017; Terracciano et al., 2017) , sleep disorders (Haba-Rubio et al., 2017) , depression (Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .",
    "In clinical studies, most studies examining the link between cortisol levels and global cognitive performance among nondemented older adults found that higher cortisol levels have been associated with poorer overall cognitive performance (Lupien et al., 2007; Lee B.K.",
    "Other trials using mifepristone that were initiated were terminated without being published, indicating that these trials were not completed, or yielded negative results (O'Banion, 2013) .",
    "In a cohort of elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, pre-operative geriatric depression scale scores were found to predict post-operative delirium.",
    "This also suggests that relatively small differences in cortisol levels can exhibit significant effects on memory performance.",
    "Moreover, certain cytokines, in particular IL-1-Beta and IL-6, which are also known to be involved in the pathophysiology of AD, can activate the HPA axis (Besedovsky and del Rey, 2000) .",
    "(2017) S found that elevated cortisol (as measured by the urinary free cortisol/creatinine ratio) and elevated intra-subject cortisol variability (as measured by the within-person urinary free cortisol/creatinine ratio variability) were associated with a 1.31-and 1.38-times increase in AD risk.",
    "Besides, in a mouse model of AD, elevated cortisol has been linked to exacerbated A\u03b2 peptide and tau pathology in the brain (Green et al., 2006) .",
    "Objective: To examine the interrelationships between cortisol, cognitive impairment and AD.",
    "Likewise, the HPA axis abnormalities associated with depression may persist even after remission (Lok et al., 2012; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) , possibly constituting trait rather than state markers for depression, even though this remains a matter of debate (Zverova et al., 2013; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017) .",
    "Moreover, cortisol concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been found to be higher in subjects with dementia and MCI due to AD compared to control subjects (Popp et al., 2009 (Popp et al., , 2015 .",
    "Currently, a phase II trial of an 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitor (UE2343) as a potential treatment for AD is being conducted (Webster et al., 2017) .",
    "A better understanding of these interrelationships between cortisol, cognition and dementia may open the door to new prevention and therapeutic options involving the HPA axis."
