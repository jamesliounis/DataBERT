    "We accounted for the complex sampling design by using the STATA 9.0 statistical software package (3, 7).",
    "The baccalaureate degree concentrationswhich were coded into three broad categories of physical science/engineering, life science, and nonscience-resulted in a categorical dependent variable (tables S1 and S2 and supporting online material text) (5) .",
    "We followed the NCES guidelines by using sampling weights for statistical analyses (3).",
    "These variables included scores from mathematics and science achievement tests (designed by the Educational Testing Service) that were administered in the first three surveys of data collection, when students were mostly enrolled in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades (3, 4) .",
    "Our analysis began with a baseline model that included only the Career Expectation independent variable and continued with successively more complex models systematically accounting for each of the four covariate groups (see table on  page 1143 and table S7) .",
    "The independent variables used in this analysis came from data collected when participants were enrolled in the eighth grade.",
    "We used the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) for this study.",
    "The sample was further reduced to a final size of 3,359 participants, because 384 participants were missing data in one or more of the variables used in the analysis.",
    "We used nationally representative longitudinal data to investigate whether sciencerelated career expectations of early adolescent students predicted the concentrations of their baccalaureate degrees earned years later.",
    "We assessed the degree to which the independent variables could predict these two comparisons.",
    "Next, we considered the estimated probabilities of earning science baccalaureate degrees produced by the final model comparison (see figure on page 1143).",
    "For example, let us compare the estimated probabilities for two pairs of prototypical students with all other variables set to means.",
    "In the NELS:88 sampling design, two analytical issues require special attention: (i) the effect of purposeful",
    "This behavior is common in such analyses because variance accounted for by initially entered variables is subsumed by successive variables.",
    "Career expectation\nCovariate groups oversampling of some ethnic and minority groups and (ii) the effect of multistage cluster sampling on standard error estimation.",
    "Researchers conducted additional surveys in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000.",
    "We therefore included four covariate groups to account for (i) academic backgrounds (science and mathematics achievement scores); (ii) students' demographics (gender and ethnicity); (iii) students' academic characteristics (enrollment in advanced versus regular mathematics and science classes, attendance in these classes, and studentreported attitudes toward mathematics and science); and (iv) parents' background (highest educational level and professional versus nonprofessional employment) (6).",
    "In our analysis, we took into account students' backgrounds and natural propensities.",
    "For example, a prototypical student expecting a science-related career has an estimated probability of obtaining a life science degree of 29% compared with 18% for a prototypical student expecting a nonscience career, with all other predictors set to the means.",
    "This reduced the sample to 3,743 participants.",
    "We applied multinomial logistic regression, which handles categorical dependent variables with more than two outcomes.",
    "We analyzed students in the United States for years 1988 through 2000 and controlled for differences in academic achievement, academic characteristics, and students' and parents' demographics.",
    "We analyzed (see figure at left) the proportion of students who earned the three types of baccalaureates degrees, according to eighthgrade expectations and math achievement scores.",
    "However, for physical science/engineering degrees, the result was quite different (see figure on page 1143, right panel).",
    "Designed and conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), NELS:88 began in 1988 with a survey of 24,599 eighth graders.",
    "The overall sample size after five surveys was 12,144 participants.",
    "Our analysis focuses on the independent variable derived from the NELS:88 survey question: \"What kind of work do you expect to be doing when you are 30 years old?\"",
    "Suppose that for the second pair, we have high mathematics achievers whose test scores were one standard deviation above average.",
    "The odds ratios, calculated from the final model, were 1.9 for life sciences versus nonscience and 3.4 for physical sciences/engineering versus nonscience (table S7) .",
    "The physical sciences and engineering are at particular risk, with declines in the number of earned doctorates in these fields among U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the past decade (2) (figs.",
    "There is an additional comparison across these pairs that should not go unnoted.",
    "We also checked for interactions between Career Expectations and the other independent variables and did not find them to be significant at the P = 0.05 level.",
    "Suppose the first pair has average mathematics achievement scores (average math achievement score at eighth grade = 45, SD = 11).",
    "Although our current analysis does not provide proof of an uninterrupted causal chain of influence, our study does suggest that to attract students into the sciences and engineering, we should pay close attention to children's early exposure to science at the middle and even younger grades.",
    "We categorized the responses into two groups: science-related and nonscience career expectations, creating the Career Expectation independent variable (4).",
    "Our analysis included two outcome comparisons in earned baccalaureate degrees: (i) earning degrees in life sciences versus nonscience areas and (ii) earning degrees in physical sciences/engineering versus nonscience areas.",
    "CAREER CHOICE Coefficients of nested models",
    "To the extent that taking courses encourages expectations, this result supports the National Science Board's contention (8) that mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 have an impact on the physical sciences and engineering workforce.",
    "Our analysis focused on those students who responded to the question about their age 30 career expectation as eighth graders in 1988 and who also obtained baccalaureate degrees from 4-year colleges or universities by 2000.",
    "PHOTO CREDIT: PHOTOS.COM EDUCATIONFORUM C oncern about U.S. leadership in science has captured the national spotlight once again (1) .",
    "For the physical science outcome, the coefficient at first attenuated from its initial value and then settled into a robust value after model 3.",
    "For example, students with stronger performance in science and mathematics may be more likely to major in the sciences.",
    "Here, the estimated probability of the student who expected a science-related future career was 51%, whereas the estimated probability of the student who expected a nonscience career was 19%.",
    "As more independent variables were included in the nested models, the coefficient remained unchanged for the life science outcome.",
    "An average mathematics achiever with a science-related career expectation has a higher probability of earning a baccalaureate degree in the physical sciences or engineering than a high mathematics achiever with a nonscience career expectation, 34% versus 19%.",
    "Most notable is the proportion of students who, in a sense, followed through on their eighth-grade science career choices-roughly half.",
    "Specifically, we asked whether eighth-grade students (approximately age 13) who reported that they expected to enter a science-related career by age 30 obtained baccalaureate degrees in science-related fields at higher rates than students who did not have this expectation.",
    "This is an attractive but expensive approach.",
    "This result suggests that, among the students who graduated with baccalaureate degrees from 4-year colleges, those who expected as eighth graders to have sciencerelated careers at age 30 were 1.9 times more likely to earn a life science baccalaureate degree than those who did not expect a science-related career.",
    "Robert H. Tai,* Christine Qi Liu, Adam V. Maltese, Xitao Fan\nYoung adolescents who expected to have a career in science were more likely to graduate from college with a science degree, emphasizing the importance of early encouragement."
