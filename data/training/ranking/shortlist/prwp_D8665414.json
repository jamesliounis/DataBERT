    "In turn, Ferreira and Araujo (2005) perform a similar exercise using Brazilian data.",

    "These studies typically are based on the estimation of aggregate production functions augmented with infrastructure stocks (for example, Serv\u00e9n 2003, 2007; Canning 1999; Demetriades and Mamuneas 2000; R\u00f6ller and Waverman 2001) , or on empirical growth equations, including measures of public infrastructure or public investment among the explanatory variables (Aschauer 1998; Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n 2004b; Easterly and Rebelo 1993; Esfahani and Ramirez 2003) .",
    "See Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2007).",
    "This is shown byTalvi and V\u00e9gh (2000) using data from developing countries, and byLane (2003) with data from industrial countries.5 As defined here, infrastructure includes land transportation, power, telecommunications, and water and sanitation.7 Jonakin and Stephens (1999) also document the decrease in Latin America's public investment over this period.",

    "3 The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "This is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 1, which shows the average ratio of public infrastructure investment to the sum of public consumption plus public infrastructure investment --a rough proxy for the overall primary expenditure of the public sector, for which information is not available.",
    "See also Easterly and Serv\u00e9n (2003) .",
    "The paper offers an overview of the links between fiscal targets, public investment, and public sector solvency.",

    "See Bassetto and Sargent (2005) for a historical background.",
    "This is illustrated by Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2003) for the case of Latin America's infrastructure.",
    "The3se issues are discussed at length byEasterly, Irwin and Serv\u00e9n (2007).",
    "22 An abundant body of empirical literature, beginning with Aschauer (1989) , has sought to quantify the contribution of public capital to growth; see Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2007) and Romp and de Haan (2005) for recent overviews.",

    "Pereira and Pinho (2006) report calculations analogous to Perotti's for 12 EU countries.",
    "The key role of O&M has been duly recognized in recent analytical literature.",
    "23 One important implication of this literature is that evaluation of alternative fiscal strategies has to take into account their respective growth consequences, not just to gauge the economy's future aggregate performance, but also to assess the full effects of the different fiscal policy paths on public finances themselves.",
    "Easterly (1999) andEasterly and Serv\u00e9n (2003, chapter 1) offer numerous examples.35 These issues are discussed at length byIrwin, Klein, Perry, and Thobani (1997) andEngel, Fischer, and Galetovic (2003).36 Buiter (1990, chapter 13) offers a rigorous illustration of the scenario in which such kind of fiscal adjustment leads to a weakening of public finances.",
    "This paper offers an analytical review of the links between fiscal targets, public investment, and growth.",
    "For example, Rioja (2003a Rioja ( , 2003b shows that if maintenance expenditures are too low, new investment in infrastructure can be growth-and welfare-reducing-while additional O&M spending has the opposite effect.",
    "48 The methods employed to evaluate net worth are described by Bradbury, Brumby and Skilling (1999) .",
    "From the preceding discussion, there are two key ingredients.",
    "45 Balassone and Franco (2000) , Buiter (2001) and Calmfors and Corsetti (2003) emphasize its limitations.",
    "14 The use of GDP as a scale variable is based on the implicit assumption that it is the main determinant of tax collection.",
    "40 In 38 To quantify this dependence, they rely on estimates of the parameters of an aggregate production function augmented with infrastructure, complemented with the estimation of empirical equations linking the accumulation of infrastructure assets to observed investment-to-GDP ratios.",
    "Finally, the bottom panel of figure 2 shows the trajectory of public investment relative to overall primary spending of the public sector.",
    "Construction of such projections raises significant technical and, even more crucially, incentive-compatibility problems (see Irwin 2005 ).",
    "Indeed, in a majority of countries public consumption rose relative to GDP, while public infrastructure investment fell, implying that the public investment cuts partly financed an expansion of public consumption.",
    "Along the same lines, the evidence suggests that fulfillment of the Maastricht deficit targets sped up the decline of public investment in the EU countries: of the nine countries that exceeded the deficit target in 1992, eight met it in 1997; in all eight, public investment had fallen relative to GDP; and in seven, it had fallen relative to total primary expenditure as well.",
    "Information on these expenditures is generally hard to obtain, but anecdotal evidence suggests that they tend to be compressed even more sharply than investment at times of fiscal retrenchment.",
    "49 For example, one of the reform options outlined by Coeure and Pisani-Ferry (2003) is organized around the concept of the \"indebtedness ratio that stabilizes net worth\".",
    "Here we shall focus on the case in which the trajectories of these variables are given arbitrarily and the government has some initial debt B.",

    "While far from unanimous, a majority of studies -especially those using physical asset stocks to measure infrastructure -find significantly positive effects of public capital on aggregate output and its growth rate, although the findings are less robust among those studies that use public investment flows (or their cumulative value) as regressors.",
    "After reviewing the international experience with public investment under fiscal adjustment, the paper lays out an analytical framework to illustrate the consequences of using the public deficit as a guide to solvency.",
    "In the Latin American context of the late 1980s and 1990s, this means that infrastructure cuts in low-debt Colombia were 80 percent effective at enhancing solvency, whereas in high-debt Bolivia, their effectiveness was only around 20 percent.",
    "Analytically, a simple illustration can be provided as follows.",
    "1 The use of public sector cash flow as sufficient statistic of fiscal discipline is especially problematic for those countries that face the task of building up their basic infrastructures, as is the case of most developing countries as well as newcomers to the European Union (EU).",
