  "shortlist": [
    "24 Rauch (2001) provides a comprehensive recent survey.",
    "In this vein, we are currently using data on the location of patenting inventors and the location of patent citations to investigate the extent of knowledge flows to inventors' formers homes (see, for example, Agrawal et.",
    "23 In a provocative recent paper, Davis and Weinstein (2002) have examined the impact of balanced flows of factors to an economy (they focus on the US) with a superior CRS",
    "19 There is a large empirical literature that attempts to measure the effect of immigration on local wages (see Borjas 1994 and Hunt 1995 for surveys) .",
    "In Table 6 we reproduce a sample of Saxenien's findings on the degree of connectedness of these admittedly elite Indian professionals to those in India.",
    "50 Statistics are un-published tabulations from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, Division of Science Resources Statistics.",
    "While aggregate data on return migration is unavailable, segment specific data such as NSF longitudinal data on PhD students suggests a number closer to 10 percent.",
    "( , 2002 provide evidence that is consistent with an overall positive effect on human capital for a number of countries, though they readily admit their data has many limitations.",
    "A useful way to think about this advantage is in terms of a multi-sector Ricardian model (see Dornbush et al, 1977) .",
    "In a widely discussed study Saxenian (1999) drew attention to the impact these absent Indians (and Chinese) were having on economic success of high tech industries in Silicon Valley.",
    "2001) , we have taken a modest step to measuring part of this loss by describing the characteristics of the US-resident Indian- Turning to Ireland, we need to know more about the backgrounds of Irish software workers from detailed survey evidence to gauge the impact of returning emigrants on the development of Irish software firms (see, however, the work of Sands, this volume).",
    "Yet the same international wage gap that created the opening for high-tech industry overall, and 43 percent in the total economy (authors' calculations from Table 3 of Central Bureau of Statistics 2002).",
    "10 Dobson et al., 2001 ).",
    "27 26 A recent paper that looks at the determinants of US foreign direct investment in Ireland is Gunnigle and McGuire (2001) .",
    "We have organized the rest of the paper around four sections.",
    "A more disaggregated analysis would give a better idea of how this immigration affected Israeli comparative advantage in software.",
    "To examine how a connected diaspora might facilitate such business, we take the example of a US software firm looking to outsource a once-off software development project, with all the attendant difficulties modeled in the Grossman and Helpman paper referenced in the introduction.",
    "One suggestive piece of evidence from the survey itself is that 73 percent of Indians responding to the question \"Which factors would figure most importantly in your decision to start a business in your country of birth?\"",
    "The first two types of studies tend to find small wage effects (see Altonji and Card 1991, and Card 1990) .",
    "A number of recent papers have developed models in which the prospect of emigration increases the expected return to human capital investment (see e.g., Beine et al.",
    "We start with crude estimates of broad Irish and Jewish ancestral diaspora and then try to narrow our focus to measurements of overseas nationals that are more directly relevant to the development of high-tech industries in the three countries.",
    "This is consistent with our intention to examine how emigration-prospective, present, and past-affects the existing population at a particular point in time.",
    "The second explanation applies the Rybczynski Theorem to predict a sectoral reallocation of resources towards industries intensive in the use of the newly abundant 42 60 percent of these scientific and academic workers are classed as engineers or architects (Central Bureau of Statistics 2001).",
    "In this section we briefly and selectively piece together what the economics literature has to say about the economic effects of emigration.",
    "Studies of the graduates of the elite Indian Institutes of\nTechnology provide a good illustration of this concern.",
    "Using earnings data from 1998, they found that returnees earned 5 percent premium over those who never left.",
    "The data on emigration stocks and flows are notoriously poor.",
    "All three countries produce impressive levels of high-end human capital; country-specific inefficiencies had meant that the human capital was poorly utilized and thus relatively cheap; and the software sector, for reasons that other papers in this volume examine, has proved relatively effective in taking advantage of this cost advantage.",
    "Finally the work of Gandal et al.",
    "2001 , and Stark and Wang 2001 .",
    "The foregoing sections have reviewed available measures of international human capital flows for the three countries, provided a (hopefully) comprehensive list of the channels through which such flows could help or hinder the development of their software industries, and applied parts of the framework to look at some specific episodes that we think have been especially important for the countries in this project.",
    "Of particular interest to the present study, Barrett and O'Connell also separately examine the premium for different industries.",
    "Their industry analysis, however, was conducted at too aggregated an industry level to get a good feel for how the software sector was affected in particular.",
    "The tension between the costs and benefits of skilled emigration for an industry that relies heavily on outsourced business comes out clearly in a recent paper by Gene\nGrossman and Elhanan Helpman (Grossman and Helpman 2002) .",
    "On the issue of the multinationals more generally, it would be interesting to go beyond anecdotal evidence about the role of the Irish, Indian and Israeli diasporas in tilting foreign direct investment in their country's favor to some harder evidence.",
    "32 However, the available evidence suggests that the probability of migrants returning declines with time -hence very few of those who stay for a decade return in the first place.",
    "We initially concentrate on US-resident emigrants because of their importance to each of the three countries and also because the US data is best.",
    "3 In this paper, then, we explore the implications of skilled emigration on the development of the software sectors in three emerging economiesIndia, Ireland, and Israel.",
    "It is increasingly recognized that a country's overseas nationals, and even those who claim distant ancestral heritage, can be a valuable economic asset (see e.g., Rauch, 2001, and Saxenian 2002) .",
    "Intriguingly, Table 3 in the paper does list one vice president for strategy of an electronics firms as listing \"culture and identity\" as one of the key factors behind the decision to locate in Ireland.",
    "In closing we note some questions relating to each of the three countries we think provide opportunities for fruitful research.",
    "We aim for a broad coverage of the effects of home country residents, which we discuss under four headings.",
    "For example, if a firm dealing in the US with Indian engineers from the elite IITs, show them to be excellently trained, this experience can lead to upward revision of priors about the quality of Indian engineers in India from these institutions, and possibly other institutions as well.",
    "To take an example, the Indian-born population in the United States aged 25 and over increased from 304,000 in 1990 to 836,000 by 2000-80 percent of whom have a tertiary education.",
    "20 The key to identifying such losses is that we consider the skilled emigration in total with the initial wage as our reference point rather than taking each emigrant one-by-one taking previous emigration as given.",
    "The three countries examined in this paper (as well as China) were all closed economies for many years during which period their diasporas played little role.",
    "We are also beginning a project that uses comprehensive lists of ethnic surnames to track knowledge flows between co-ethnics.",
    "There are three main types of studies: area studies that compare wages across labor markets receiving different numbers of immigrants; natural experiments that look for immigration changes that are independent of developments in local labor markers; and calibration studies that estimate how relative factor supplies affect relative wages for different skill groups and then calculate how immigration with a given skill mix affects relative wages.",
    "These survey results indicate that the Silicon Valley based Indian diaspora have transnational links with the Indian IT sector.",
    "31 The fact that the share of India's IT exports-North America 62 percent, Europe 24 percent Japan 4 percent-is roughly the average of these regions share of India's skill migration and the region's share of global IT industry-is suggestive that incorporating the size and skills of diasporas in gravity models of global IT trade may be worthwhile."
