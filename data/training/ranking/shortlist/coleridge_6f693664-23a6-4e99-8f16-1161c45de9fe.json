  "query": "What dataset was used in the paper?",
  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "This data set of 9146 papers were further used for analysis.",
    "The insights that we draw from our analysis of the 9146 papers is presented in different sections below",
    "Table 1 highlights these influential papers.",
    "The study has used various types of data sets and analytical techniques as highlighted below to capture the research trends and also assess this disease influence on the society.",
    "Data for the Policy Documents referencing these top ten co-cited papers was done by accessing altmetrics.com directly from the dimensions database.",
    "This analysis was undertaken to identify the key knowledge base behind the identified papers.",
    "Dimensions database was used to extract a bibliographic mapping file for the papers.",
    "The present study is motivated by this and applies tools and techniques of scientometrics to uncover insights from research papers.",
    "Table 4 highlights the details of these co-cited papers at trim level 3 which identifies top 10 cocited papers.",
    "The Dimensions database (www.dimensions.ai) was used for this study.",
    "This study also was cited in policy documents.",
    "One of the useful method that can do so is based on cocitation analysis which captures frequency with which two documents are cited together (Small, 1973) .",
    "The search string applied on the publications database of Dimensions resulted in 9146 papers, containing 7332 articles and 1814 pre-prints.",
    "Initially the bibliographic mapping file was run on the VOSviewer software to identify the most co-cited papers.",
    "The altmetrics data was captured from Dimensions database which draws data from altmetrics.com of capturing online activity of research papers on Facebook, twitter, blogpost, news reports etc.",
    "Co-citation analysis helps to capture papers that are co-cited together in a large number of papers.",
    "The study attempts to answer the following research questions:\n\uf0b7 What are the key papers that captures the most relevant research, areas and topics on COVID-19?",
    "provides researchers a wider scope to share their scholarly publications.",
    "Citations that influence current research activity would however be useful to construct the present knowledge base.",
    "Scientometrics applies various mathematical and statistical techniques to capture insights of research activity from research papers and patents and other published sources including online sources (Altmetrics) by constructing various types of indicators.",
    "The highly co-cited papers is seen as the core knowledge base of research area at a particular period.",
    "Two software's Pajek and VOSviewer were used for co-citation analysis.",
    "The table provides a broad indication of intensity of research happening in different fields.",
    "This is true for research paper as well as patent citations.",
    "These features motivated us to use this database for this study.",
    "Popularity of a paper can also be seen influenced by journals; papers with high altmetrics score strongly correlate with journals that have high reputation in the field (high impact factor, leading journal of the community).",
    "Citation based analysis is a prominent method to capture academically significant and theoretically relevant material (see for example Glanzel, 2003) .",
    "Table 2 points to some interesting aspects of research activity in this area.",
    "Figure 1 presents a word cloud of most frequently used terms in Covid-19 Papers.",
    "Ten most popular research papers among the 9146 COVID-19 papers were extracted on the basis of their Altmertrics score on April 12, 2020.",
    "The paper positions itself in this direction; applying various tools and techniques of scientometrics, Altmetrics and Google Trends to draw meaning from the huge volume of research papers and online activity surrounding this pandemic.",
    "Examining from the Dimensions database as of 22 April, it was found that 1633 clinical trials are being conducted on the virus and 171 policy documents have been published so far.",
    "Search conducted in two different time periods, 28 th March and then on 12 th April showed that 2172 and 9146 papers were published in these two periods; almost 320 percent growth during such a short time.",
    "The co-cited papers were identified at four levels (trim levels) to have a deeper insight of the core knowledge base: Level 1 identified 51 papers co-cited 77 or more times; Level 2 identified 26 papers co-cited 126 or more times; Level 3 identified 10 papers co-cited 277 or more times, and Level 4 identified 5 papers co-cited 463 or more times.",
    "Keeping in view the research activity in this area started primarily with the outbreak of this disease, impact captured through citations would not give a correct picture as citations takes time to accrue.",
    "Thus, examination of the word cloud is useful to have a broad view of key areas of research in the 9146 papers.",
    "Country wise analysis showed that around 78 percent of the total papers were contributed by ten countries.",
    "Further analysis of research activity of the ten identified countries was done using altmetric and citation analysis.",
    "The network file was then run on Pajek software to create a refined co-citation network map so as to avoid overlapping of nodes.",
    "Co-Citation establishes an intellectual relationship with earlier literature in a field/subfield/area of research; strength of relationship based on frequency of co-citation pairs.",
    "Altmetrics or article level metrics according to Das and Mishra (2014) is a \"new trendsetter\" to measure \"impact of scientific publication and their social outreach to intended audience\".",
    "One of the most influential study was by Ginsberg et al.",
    "For example, it was found that nCoV which some studies have used also identifies papers that cover MERS (Middle-East respiratory syndrome).",
    "This line of treatment and the robustness of the methodology and findings have also generated critical comments, see for example Grens (2020) .",
    "Influential papers were distinguished by using Altmetric score which is a weighted count of all the online attention of a research paper.",
    "One useful method would be from online trends surrounding this disease that would indicate to some extent the key issues that are influencing the society at large.",
    "Word cloud provides a high visual representation of concepts that a paper had frequently applied.",
    "Table 3 highlights the areas covered in the COVID-19 papers.",
    "Figure 2 shows co-citation networks at four trim levels.",
    "According to Mavragani et al."
