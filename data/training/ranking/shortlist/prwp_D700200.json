    "The results are discussed below.",
    "SeeCornia (1987),IDB (1987b),PREALC (1985), van der Gaag,Stelcner and Vijverberg (1989), andTokman (1986).",
    "Advances in statistical research have made it possible to implement a set of data diagnostic tests to reveal statistical problems arising from imperfect data or highly influential sets of observations.",
    "For a discussion seeStelcner and Moock (1988),Moock, Musgrove, and Stelcner (1989), andFreeman and Norcliffe (1985).",
    "The results for the Peru Living Standards Survey data make use of this optimal window width and a Gaussian kernel.",
    "It accounts for a substantial fraction 1 For more recent literature see Bromley (1978) , Cornia (1987) , Hallak and Caillods (1982) , Hart (1987) , House (1984) , IDB (1987a) , Mattera (1985) , Moser and Marsie-Hazen (1984) , Sethuraman (1981) , Stewart (1987) , and Tokman (1978) .",
    "The first set of plots was studied for patterns (for example, positive residuals for large values of the variables) that might indicate that the specification was not robust.",
    "Several recent studies have identified these general patterns.",
    "In our case there were iterations with respect to both model specification and inclusion/exclusion of data points in the sample reflecting the inflow of information from the battery of diagnostic tests to which the model and data were subjected.",
    "In the leverage analysis, the data were searched for points that were farthest from the center \" For an excellent discussion of these issues, see Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980) , and Chatterjee and Hadi (1988) .",
    "The diagnostic techniques involve searching the data for single observations or sets of observations that differ significantly from the 'average' data point and may have an excessive influence on the regression results.",
    "Our analysis involved assessing the sensitivity of parameter estimates to what we term \"data problems.\"",
    "These results led to the hypothesis that an aggregate model based on a pooled sample could be estimated.",
    "The theoretical model is applied to data from the Peru Living Standards Survey (PLSS).",
    "(See Table 3) We use the follr.wing variables in the empirical analysis.",
    "The reader is referred to Ullah (1988) for a more complete -discussion of the development and use of nonparametric techniques in economics.",
    "Current research in the statistics literature has been aimed at resolving such questions using differential geometry.",
    "of the sample) need detailed examination.",
    "The results below are based on a nonparametric approach (described in appendix B).",
    "Finally, we examined the plots of the studentized residuals against the independent variables and against the fitted values of the dependent variable.",
    "Finally, as a further test of validity, we analyzed the data using nonparametric techniques (see Appendix B).",
    "The survey results provide informiiation or.",
    "Table Blcontains information on the variables entering the rural model; the format of is identical to that of urban areas.27 We present results for the case where dummy variables are used to distinguish schooling levels.",
    "Although the PLSS is an unusually clean data set, where much effort was devoted to correcting anomalies, it is still open to a variety of impurities due to, inter alia, measurement errors, data entry, and inaccurate reporting by respondents and enumerators.",
    "The researcher estimates the model in (17) or (18) and its properties by estimating the conditional mean and how the conditional mean depends upon the conditioning varirbles.",
    "The second test involved plotting residuals against leverage values to identify outliers, that is, those observations where the residuals were large.",
    "costs, and other characteristics of factors employed by the firm will be available in cross-section or time series data sets.",
    "We first present regression results for the final models for urban areas and comment on some (ex post) tests for aggregation and pooling.",
    "With cross-section data the absence of separate information on price and quantity may cause fewer problems than in a time series setting where constancy of price is difficult to justify as a working assun,ption.",
    "In a representative diagram the information is: In diagram Cl, the relevant sample is all firms, ordered from largest to smallest according to the size of the estimated marginal revenue product of the relevant factor (in this case, capital).",
    "A feeling for the results can be obtained by considering the row of means.",
    "Statistical tests of the extent of curvature relative to the distance of the estimated model from the dependent variable can be performed and the significance of deviations from linearity can be assessed (see Bates and Watts 1980) .",
    "The initial model was given by:",
    "The second plots provided information about possible nonlinear relationships in the residuals.",
    "Recent work by Racine (1989) has examined the optimal window width, h, in the sense of integrated mean square error.",
    "Our analysis involved setting critical values for these variables and dropping observations in excess of these values.",
    "Equations 22and 23show that the only information required to estimate the conditional means and the derivatives is the joint density function f(y,x).",
    "The simulation results in Table 9 are quite similar to those obtained in the analysis of factor productivity discussed earlier.",
    "The approach led to a model that is extremely robust, provides an excellent fit of the data, and is very close to the initial model in both specification and sample.",
    "See Stelcner and Moock (1988),and Moock, Musgrove, and Stelcner (1989).",
    "For this reason the isolation and careful study of influential observations is an important task in applied modeling.",
    "In the empirical work we found that o 2 was about equal to 0.773 and thus that the scaling factor was about 1.47.",
    "See Cornia (1987),Everett and Savara (1986),Herz (1989), Hossain (1987), IDB (1988),Tendler (1983), United Nations (1985, and WorldBank (1989).",
    "In the applied research it is assumed that the cumulative distribution function, F, is given by the logistic",
    "These observations were removed from the data set and the model was reestimated to evaluate their influence on the regression results.",
    "The theory behind these tests for linear models has been developed extensively in the statistics literature.",
    "The Peru Living Standards Survey provided information on the current debt position of each household, and on the source and termns of loans obtained in the past year.",
    "Our concern arises from two sources: the data have high measured leverage, and the regression residuals are large in absolute value.",
    "The important question to raise is whether the linearized version of the nonlinear model is accurate over a sufficiently large range of the parameter space so as to include confidence intervals measured in the standard way.",
    "Before considering comparative returns in different types of enterprises, it is useful to determine the extent to which the mean values are informative."
