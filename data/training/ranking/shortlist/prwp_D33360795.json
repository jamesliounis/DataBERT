    "In this paper, we rely on the most recent version of the data-the 2006 version (Bayer, 2006) .",
    "Our paper contributes to the literature in at least two ways.",
    "See OAMDI (2016) for data documentation.6 In every wave of the survey, a refresher sample of 2,000-3,000 observations is included to allow for a more in-depth examination of phenomena of interest.",
    "In this paper, we rely on data from the ELMPS 2012.",
    "We also check the robustness of our results to using pooled cross-sectional data from the 2012 and 2018 ELMPS.",
    "We report our results in Table A .12 in the Online Appendix.",
    "In this paper, we focus particularly on the 2012 round (ELMPS 2012).",
    "As shown in the descriptive statistics in Table A .2 in the Online Appendix, these events coincide with greater undocumented migration in the 1980s.",
    "Based on the Development Economics Group data from the World Bank, Brodmann, Pouget, and Gatti (2010) show that, in 2005, Egypt was among the top 10 emigration countries in the world.",
    "Relying on the 2018 data, we also analyze the dynamics of the effects.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Notes: We rely on pooled cross-sectional data from the 2012 and 2018 ELMPS.",
    "For the post-World War II era, the data is collected from various data sources including Europa World Year Book series, ministries of foreign affairs of various countries, Statesman's Year Book, and the Code Diplomatique.",
    "Nonetheless, in this section, we replicate our analysis using the most recent publicly available survey as a robustness check.",
    "We report the results in Table A .15 in the Online Appendix, unconditional on return migration.",
    "See the Data Appendix B.2 for a description of the Monadic Conflict Onset and Incidence data set from the Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP).20 Labor Force participation rate, employment in agriculture, industry, and services come from Key indicators of the Labor Market Database of the International Labor Organization.",
    "In the second column, differences with respect to the group of non-migrants and the associated p-value for a t-test of whether the difference between the two groups is statistically significant.",
    "First, we estimate the model by focusing on migrants who belong to the lowest 33 rd percentile of the distribution of migration duration (those who have 2 years of migration or less) and we report the corresponding results in column (4a).",
    "Data comes from the World Bank Development Indicators.",
    "To capture the dynamics of the effects, instead of focusing on the full 2018 sample as in Table A .14, we restrict our analysis, in Table  A .16, to individuals who were interviewed in both ELMPS 2012 and 2018.",
    "For the empirical analysis, we use data from the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS).",
    "We further corroborate this evidence in Panel B, where we present a scatter plot on the relationship between oil prices and the share of illegal migrants from the 1960s to 2010.",
    "In line with the descriptive statistics presented in Table A .2 in the Online Appendix, the results in Table 10 suggest that the illegal status of migrants negatively affects their monthly wages and savings, while abroad.",
    "In the regression tables, we report the samples used for the estimation of each equation.15 98% of return migrants in our estimation sample went to other Arab countries.16 InTable A.3 in the Online Appendix, we also report descriptive statistics on current migrants and return migrants.",
    "InTable A.1 in the Online Appendix, we also examine the geographical transition matrices for non-migrants and return migrants in Panel A and Panel B, respectively.",
    "We contribute to the literature on undocumented migration, which is rather sparse given the lack of data.",
    "In column (2), we focus on the subsample of documented migrants compared to nonmigrants, and in column (3), we compare undocumented migrants to non-migrants.",
    "In Panel A, labor force participation rate, employment in agriculture, industry and services are from the International Labor Organization, Key indicators of the Labor Market Database.",
    "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
    "We use data from the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 2012), which has several major advantages.",
    "Second, we estimate the model by considering returnees who belong to the middle 33 rd percentile of the distribution with 3 to 5 years of migration and we report results in column (4b).",
    "We find a correlation coefficient of 0.042 with an associated P-value of 0.787.",
    "In Table A .17 in the Online Appendix, we also check the robustness of our results to excluding individuals who had more than two migration episodes and our results are also robust to this check.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Notes: Data comes from the 2018 ELMPS survey.",
    "Our total sample consists of 14,897 observations: 12,804 individuals are non-migrants, 1,346 are return migrants (out of whom 481 had an undocumented migration), and 747 individuals are current migrants.",
    "We find a correlation coefficient of 0.118 with a P-value 0.476.",
    "In this section, we discuss issues pertaining to the validity of our empirical model presented in section 4.1.",
    "By design, it over-sampled areas with high migration rates, and is nationally representative once weights are applied (Assaad & Krafft, 2013) .",
    "In Table A.5 in the Online Appendix, we compute the occupational indices followingSicherman and Galor (1990) andCarletto and Kilic (2011).",
    "We account for the various selection processes in columns (1) to (3) following the same identification strategy presented in section 4.1.",
    "In Table A.7 and Table A .8 in the Online Appendix, we check the robustness of our results relying on this alternative definition of undocumented migration.",
    "The 2012 round is therefore advantageous for our analysis as it oversampled areas with high migration rates, which allows us to have a larger sample on migrants and to better disentangle the effect of illegality.",
    "We report the results on the various selection equations in columns (1) to (3), while columns (4a) to (4e) report the results from our structural equation on various outcomes pertaining to the migration experience overseas.",
    "Notes: This table presents geographical transition matrices for non-migrants (Panel A) and return migrants (Panel B) between the region of birth and the geographical region in 2012.",
    "26 In line with Gonzales (2011), Gleeson and Gonzales (2012) , and Hall and Greenman (2015) , this might suggest that undocumented migrants are employed in poorer jobs, which might make them less likely to benefit from their migration experience overseas compared to documented migrants.",
    "There is also a well-established academic literature on the determinants and impacts of migration on countries of origin.",
    "In Table A .13 in the Online Appendix, we check the robustness of our results to controlling for the following variables in Egypt in the return migration equation: FDI (% of GDP), remittances (% of GDP), and the exports and imports of goods and services (% of GDP).",
    "In Table A .14 in the Online Appendix, we report our results unconditional on return migration.",
    "In our data set, 80% of return migrants had one migration episode, 15% had two migration episodes and less than 5% had more than two migration episodes.",
    "This is done either assuming that the missingness pattern of the data is exogeneous or endogenous-as in our model-relying on proper identification to model these various selection processes.",
    "Our empirical analysis relies on a conditional mixed process (CMP) model, following Roodman (2011) ."
