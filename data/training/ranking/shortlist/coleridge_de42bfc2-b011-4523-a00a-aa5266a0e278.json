  "shortlist": [
    "For this paper, as in ref.",
    "In our experiments, we used brain MRI data from the ADNI database [4] .",
    "This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the diagnostic parameters.",
    "Then we performed an analysis using vector classification methods on the same dataset we used for the analysis of [3] , to examine whether differences between AD and NL subjects could be identified with some combinations of the features.",
    "We combined the correlation parameters together with a few other deformation parameters into a seven-dimensional vector, and applied three vector-classification methods to investigate if such vectors could yield distinguish between AD and NL subjects in agreement with the ground truth data for 31 subjects from the ADNI database.",
    "This field can then be used to calculate the (diagnostic) parameters (See, e.g., refs.",
    "As shown in Table 2 , the scale of the features will largely affect the accuracy.",
    "From the result, which is shown in Table 3 , we can see that it has a high accuracy (90.32% for all sets), while the optimal AD and NL accuracy rate can be achieved at the same time for the original feature data and the Scaled feature data, as shown in Table 3 .",
    "PARAMETERS In this section we introduce the parameters mentioned above, and give a short motivation for their use.",
    "For each longitudinal group of data and their derived deformation field and Jacobian determinant, we computed the coefficients given in Eqs.",
    "The regions that are used to calculate the correlation coefficients mentioned above can be selected from this window either manually, or automatically, using the data of the IBSR mask.",
    "Below we describe some of its functionality.",
    "The study we describe below should give a first indication of whether the application of such a method could be developed further and studied in greater detail, for which the discerning effects should be significantly present.",
    "Thus considering the percentage of AD and NL in our whole dataset (12 in 31, and 19 in 31), it becomes clear that the optimal result does not occur when all subjects are considered simultaneously, as is shown in Table 1 .",
    "(This is obtained with the aid of an exhaustive search).",
    "In order to facilitate the diagnostic analysis, we built a user interface that can visualize the deformation within the structures we want to study, and can facilitate the selection of the regions for which we want to measure the local and inter-structural effects of atrophy.",
    "In this work, we performed a study of the correlations of atrophy between the hippocampus and the ventricles for distinguishing AD patients from NL persons.",
    "The sizes of the features may play a role, e.g.",
    "In order to investigate whether information about the difference between AD and NL could be derived from such a vector, we performed several experiments using automated vector classification methods.",
    "Thus, the quantitative automatic analysis with the aid of the new parameters adds some extra diagnostic power to the version discussed in ref.",
    "We used 19 sets of NL subjects' and 12 sets of AD patients' longitudinal brain MRI images as input to compute the displacement field and Jacobian determinant between the baseline and the follow-up images by Christensen's method.",
    "The field that deals with these issues is denoted as \"Computational Anatomy\" (CA), a term introduced by Grenander and Miller in 1998 [1] .",
    "The next few parameters are the ones that measure correlations between two brain regions.",
    "The methods we used here provide some new features to the ones we developed in ref.",
    "Therefore, in this paper, we introduce four correlation parameters to measure and analyze correlations of atrophy rate between hippocampus and ventricles.",
    "This process can be identified in the MRI images by comparing images of the same patient, at different times (denoted as \"longitudinal studies\").",
    "(2)- (5), when R and R' are the ventricles and hippocampus regions within this volume of 16 slices respectively, as well as the and ventricle region size and the ventricle and hippocampus region divergence as our seven components feature vector.",
    "[1, 5] In this paper we introduce the possibility of measuring correlations of deformation between different brain structures through the introduction of a number of \"correlation parameters\".",
    "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).",
    "We obtain a good agreement between our classification results and the ground truth data.",
    "We find that the Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and hippocampus and Ventricle Region size are the most useful.",
    "In Section 3 we describe some aspects of the new user interface, particularly the part that facilitates the selection of the regions that can be studied.",
    "After we select two ROIs R and R', we can determine the correlation coefficients given by Eqs.",
    "We also performed a leaveone-out cross validation to see which parameters were most useful for the diagnosis.",
    "We combine these parameters with three local atrophy rate parameters into a sevendimensional vector, and use various vector classification methods to see if the methods can distinguish AD patients from normal (NL) subjects in 31 longitudinal MRI baseline images and their follow-ups from the ADNI database.",
    "In order to perform a quantitative analysis, transformations of images into one another need to be defined and calculated, after which the diagnosis can be facilitated through the calculation of \"diagnostic parameters\".",
    "It appeared that such differences did indeed occur, and that a good correspondence was achieved between the diagnosis and the ground truth data.",
    "Therefore we tested three of them, viz.",
    "The analysis is facilitated with the aid of a specially designed graphical user interface.",
    "We tested these three methods on different combinations of the input features.",
    "Because the size of the ventricles is also a reliable indicator of AD, and because its segmentation can be done accurately, we also added this to the feature vector.",
    "We implemented the enhanced Graphical User Interface in Matlab.",
    "A better solution, that keeps both high accuracy and the simultaneous optimal accuracy for AD, NL and overall data, was obtained by the SVM method with a Quadratic kernel function.",
    "Mean Scalar Product Correlation.",
    "Section 4 describes the different vector classification methods to distinguish AD from NL with the aid of our diagnostic parameters.",
    "Once the ROI is selected, the deformation vectors can be shown in a separate window (see Fig.",
    "All three vector methods showed good agreement of the diagnosis with the ground truth data, but the SVM method yielded the best results.",
    "The combination of the input features for which the SVM method attains its highest accuracy is given by: Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and Hippocampus and Ventricle Region size.",
    "In addition, we used the leave-one-out cross validation method to test the usefulness of both the features and the classification methods.",
    "This coefficient will yield an indication about whether there will be mainly contraction or expansion in both of the regions, and their correlation."
