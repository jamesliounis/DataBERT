    "1.4 Accordingly this paper-drawing on Northern European experience-has been written to assist transition and developing countries address three policy-related issues:",
    "The main academic contributors to the UK debate have been Goodhart (1996) , Taylor (1995 Taylor ( ,1996 and Goodhart et al (1998) .",
    "Finally, Section V sets out the main conclusions and identifies areas where further research would be warranted in this fast developing area of interest.",
    "The UK FSA offers the most recent experience however and this in the context of a \"big bang\" involving some 1800 staff in London.",
    "1.5 In order to address these issues the paper is structured in five sections.",
    "6 While the absence of hard data to confirm this opinion makes it difficult to arrive at a decisive conclusion that an integrated approach has generated regulatory efficiencies, the pervasiveness of this belief throughout the senior management of the integrated regulatory authorities is striking.",
    "They also report having been influenced by broad y similar considerations in making the move towards an integrated approach to regulation and tc having reaped many of the same benefits from this approach.",
    "One motivation behind this most recent reorganization is to facilitate the emergence of a matrix structure in which \"centers of expertise\" is developed with the at lity to collect know-how that can be applied across a number of different departments.",
    "Similar factors were also at wor]k in Sweden.",
    "This economy of scale argument-which might equally be termed the \"small country argument\" -is cited by all the Scandinavian countlics as a significant factor in their adoption of an integrated approach.",
    "Readers interested in issues of change management in integrated agencies should refer also to the more generic literature on mergers and change management.",
    "The most recent rationale for the integrated regulator model can be found in Briault's paper (1999) .",
    "This was the experience of the Scandinavian merged agencies as well as the UK FSA where a first year turnover rate of 13% was registered (some staff did not want to extend their commute times to the relatively remote location of Canary Wharf).",
    "The box below illustrates the added factors that come into play when considering integration in a transition environment.",
    "As noted earlier this meant that there were a number of sub-optimal practices (such as reporting to old and new boards) that had to be retained for a time.",
    "It also has a similar range of responsibilities to the Kredittilsynet (see Box 2.2).",
    "A similar structure was followed in.",
    "(It should be noted, however, that one consequence of the early 1 990s crisis was that the Kredittilsynet embarked on a program aimed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness and this may mean that its role in any future crisis would be enhanced.).",
    "Moreover some ofthese issues arise in an especially acute forn under an integrated approach so it is important to address these.",
    "Although it is difficult to measure efficiency gains and economies of scale in any mearningful sense for these types of admninistrative agency, all three agencies believe that they have realized significant benefits from this source.",
    "In the first place, it was argued that centralizing rt-gulatory fiunctions and activities can permit significant gains from economies of scale through the development of joint ad[ministrative, IT and other support functions.",
    "This debate lies beyond the scope of this paper, although it should be noted that only the United Kingdom, of the countries surveyed, has created a unified regulator with both prudential and c .nduct of business responsibilities.",
    "A, similar consideration seems to have been at work in Sweden's decision to unify its regulator) system.",
    "The purpose of the decision-tree (set out below) is to assist in the process of choice of organizational model.",
    "Proponents of this approach argue that the benefits of integration could be reaped in a fragmented structure by simply ensuring that there is a high degree of cooperation and information flow between the agencies.",
    "This, it was argued, enabled the sharing of market intelligence and led to some important synergies.",
    "Over time (and as noted earlier in the paper) there should be more radical experimentation with different organizational forms that cut across cultures and emphasize functional rather than the earlier institutional breakclowns of staff.",
    "All of these issues are important in their own right but ii: is through examining these in some detail that the subtlety of differences between the models adopted by the five countries under consideration here can be discerned.",
    "]Tn addition, it will also review some of the common administrative issues that emerged from these countries' experience in bringing their integrated agencies into being.",
    "The Danish example is perhaps the most striking in this regard.",
    "2.12 The rationale for bringing together banking, securities, and insurance regulation within a single organization has been most fully explored by the Norwegian Royal Commission which reported in 1985.3 Its conclusions have been endorsed, at least implicitly, by the other Scandinavian countries that have established IFSSAs.",
    "Hence, taken together, Northern European experience can potentially provide a rich source of guidance for those countries contemplating a move to the integrated model.",
    "The question of how the integration of the constituent agencies can be implemented effectively is broached in Section III.",
    "It is pertinent to ask therefore what lessons can be drawn from their several years of experience with an integrated approach.",
    "2.9 Against this background, Finland's decision not to adopt a fully integrated approach to supervision, despite many superficial points of similarity with the other Scandinavian countries, also means that it represents a useful point of comparison.",
    "The Scandinavian experience can shed light on the transitional issues as the agencies concerned have now had time to \"settle\" in the wake of the merger.",
    "The \"head institution\" in any situation would depend on the precise nature of the problem.",
    "In this case the benefits of an integrated approach have not been as evident in practice as might have been expected in theory.",
    "In addition to reviewing these issues, this section will also consider the extent to which the alleged benefits of integrated regulation have actually been delivered in the Northern.",
    "Denmark's legislation is tle least harmonized of the three countries, although this does not in practice seem to have resulted in any serious problems and an effort is in any case currently under way to improve the coherer ce of its legislative framework.",
    "data collection, all administrative support and human resource functions bought from the Bank of Finalsn, the Finnish FSA has also been able to achieve significant scale economies.",
    "The lead in resolving the crisis of 1990-91 was taken by the Finance Ministry and the central bank, as well as the agencies established by parliament to undertake the recapitalization of the barnking system.",
    "The final steps towards full integration in the early 1990s were discussed in the Scandinavian press and debated in the respective ministries bul.",
    "It is appropriate that these be done in the context of a well managed change program.",
    "This has been especially influential among the Scar dinavian countries that have needed to maximize their use of scarce human resources if they are t be able to participate fully in international regulatory forums.",
    "As noted above, the current trend towards IFS SAs began in Northern Europe, s:pecifically in the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Denmark and Sweden.",
    "Northern European experience has been able to shed some light on the three questions posed at the outset of this paper that were central to the debate on integration of financial regulation in transition and developing economies.",
    "As in Norway the desire to achieve more effective regulation of financial conglomerates was one of the primary factors influencing the Danish decision to move to a fully integrated approach.",
    "A final factor behind Sweden's decision was the observation that other Scandinavian countries had already adopted the integrated approach.",
    "As already stressed at a number of points in th.is paper, there is a premium on high quality management who can make an integrated supe:rwisory authority a reality."
