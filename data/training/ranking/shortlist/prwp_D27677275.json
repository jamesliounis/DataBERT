    "Columns 1-4 and 6-9 contain unconditional mean estimates (and sd) for each sample listed for the visits overall, to EMPs, and to private providers (Panel A) or the inverse hyperbolic sine overall, at EMPs, and at private providers (Panel B).",
    "We examine several potential mechanisms to explain these results.",

    "There are similar significant decreases in overall spending and spending at private facilities for ineligible children in insured households, but no statistically significant effects on out-of-pocket expenditures among eligible children (Appendices S6 and S7).15 The reduced form results presented according to CONSORT guidelines can be found in Appendix S8 .",
    "The analyses in the paper are also limited in the set of health indicators that are measured within the setting and time frame.",

    "Panel A present estimated coefficients from non-linear least square specifications where \"6 Month Subsidy\" is the parent's random assignment status and 6 Month Subsidy*Ineligible is the interaction of these two variables.",

    "6, 7 Respondents could enroll in the insurance plan at the INSS or at local micro- 5 Respondents were selected with the following two methodologies: in the first phase of the survey, prior to the baseline survey a census of market booths was conducted to define the sampling frame of possible respondents.",
    "Column 11 contains the difference-in-difference estimate between eligible and ineligible children across the treatment and the control groups, adjusted for round and market fixed effects.",
    "There are no significant added effects of 16 We also conduct falsification checks to determine the sensitivity of the results, where we replace the outcome measures from the follow-up survey with the baseline measures (Appendices S9 and S10).",
    "A related literature examines how parental insurance eligibility affects health insurance enrollment of eligible children, finding positive spillovers on children's enrollment into Medicaid in the United States (Dubay and Kenney 2003; Sommers 2006; Aizer and Grogger 2003; Busch and Duchovny 2005) .",
    "Unfortunately, we lack the data to test whether the change in utilization among eligible and ineligible children is due to economies of scale with respect to travel or time costs, such as parents taking insured children with them to the doctor.",
    "6 The study design also assigned respondents into 2-month subsidy group during the first phase of the project; these individuals were not included in the follow-up survey.",
    "The dependent variables are the inverse hyperbolic sine of expenditures at various providers over the past year.Note that the regressions of EMP and public facility expenditures as dependent in Panel B could not be estimated due to insufficient variation.",
    "Individuals without valid income data were imputed to be the median and regressions were run with a dummy variable indicating the missing value.",

    "Regressions control for baseline measures of household size, household size squared, the inverse hyperbolic sine of household income, parent's years of education, age of child, age of child squared, gender, whether the child was sick in the past year, the number of times sick, total number of health visits, and survey round and market fixed effects.",

    "We do not believe that this is cause for concern due to the large number of hypotheses tested in this table and because this outcome has a low mean in the sample at baseline (0.028).",
    "The results from these existing studies may not apply to children or to the developing country context because the elasticity of health care demand has been found to be larger in the developing country setting and larger for children as compared to adults (Zhou et al.",
    "The dependent variable in Panel B is the number of times the child has visited various providers over the past year.",
    "The dependent variable is the expenditures at various providers over the past year.",

    "10 To benchmark the effects on children, the empirical results begin by estimating the effects of the insurance among parents, with the following specification:",
    "At the end of the baseline survey, respondents were either given an informational brochure about the insurance product or the brochure plus a six-month subsidy for insurance worth approximately USD$100, nearly half of the sample's median household income.",

    "9 These take-up rates of health insurance are comparable to the existing literature.",
    "(2010) also measures whether the location of enrollment (at a micro-finance facility or the standard INSS enrollment location) affects the enrollment decisions of informal-sector workers, and whether MFI clients have different utilization patterns than non-MFI clients.",
    "The dependent variable in Panel B is the number of times the parent has visited various providers over the past year.",
    "17 The results in Table 4 show that the effects of health insurance do not differ by whether the ineligible child has a covered sibling, suggesting that the results are primarily driven by having insured parents.",

    "Before presenting the main effects of the insurance on children, we show the effects of being insured among parents, according to Equation 1, as a benchmark, (Appendices S3 and S4).",
    "Participants deemed eligible through the census were selected randomly (stratified by gender, marital status, and micro-finance client status) and administered the baseline survey."
