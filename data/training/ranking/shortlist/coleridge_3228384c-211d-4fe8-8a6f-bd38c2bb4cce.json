    "Participants for the analysis were drawn from a meta-database consisting of 18 ADCS studies and ADNI, representing both clinical trials and observational studies in AD, MCI, and normal individuals (National Institutes of Health grant R01 AG037561) [10] .",
    "Analyses were performed using version 3.0.3 of the R programming environment [24] .",
    "To provide a more comprehensive picture, we analyzed data from seven studies in a metadatabase of AD clinical trials and observational studies.",
    "Thus, for participant i51; 2; :::; n at visit j51; 2; :::; n i , the model was ADAS i;j 5 age i 1 education i 1 group i 1 time i;j 1 group i !",
    "We examined pooled clinical trials data to assess the utility of enriching trials using baseline cognition.",
    "Recently, Ito and colleagues developed a mathematical model of disease progression in AD based on metaanalysis of summary data from the literature [6] and individual-level data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [7] , with this model receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for simulating clinical trials.",
    "The primary analyses were conducted using a mixed effects linear model (random coefficients model) [22] , which adjusts for missing data in testing for differences in the intercepts (baseline scores) and slopes (rate of change) of the ADAS-Cog between groups defined by MMSE categories.",
    "This association remained significant after adjusting for age and education (P , .001; Table 3 and Fig.",
    "The mixed effects model was used as it analyzes data from all participants (rather than just completers) and minimizes bias, and it has better controls for type I error in the presence of missing data [23] .",
    "Of the 2888 participants with AD in these 10 studies, 6 were excluded due to missing data, yielding a total of 2882 participants for analysis.",
    "These results are consistent with the results of the disease progression models of Ito and colleagues [6, 7] , although they did not report individual-level analyses apart from ADNI.",
    "A model was constructed with group effect, visit effect, and group by visit interactions, with age and education as covariates.",
    "As examples of this, we used the meta-database to examine the placebo arm of a clinical trial restricted to more severe samples and to less severe samples (Box 1).",
    "Mixed model analyses were performed using version 3.1-118 of the NLME package for R [25] .",
    "The primary outcome measure was the ADAS-Cog, a standard scale for AD clinical trials that evaluates memory, reasoning, orientation, praxis, language, and word finding difficulty.",
    "These analyses support prior observations that participants in AD clinical trials show different ADAS-Cog outcomes based on initial severity on the MMSE.",
    "Our meta-database of clinical trials spans more than two decades, and secular changes in the conduct of clinical trials over this time frame could have affected results.",
    "Methods: We included 2882 participants with mild to moderate AD in seven studies from a meta-database.",
    "For example, the mean difference in ADAS-Cog scores between the lower (MMSE 15-18) and higher (MMSE 23-26) end of most clinical trials after 24 months was 21.2 points (Table 4) .",
    "The rates of decline on the ADASCog also showed significant differences overall (P , .001), although the slope change from one group to the next higher group was small relative to the differences in baseline scores (Fig.",
    "Our analysis has several notable strengths, including the large sample size and the inclusion of a diverse sample of clinical trials across multiple sites.",
    "Interpretations: Although we found significant differences in rate of decline, most differences between individuals were from baseline ADAS-Cog values.",
    "However, most of the differences in ADAS-Cog scores at the end of the trial were due to differences in baseline scores, as shown by the wide separation of groups at month 0. for baseline MMSE scores of 12-22 instead of 12-26 resulted in a difference of less than one point per year on the ADAS-Cog, but reduced the available sample pool by more than 800 subjects.",
    "However, the results of post hoc analyses have not been consistent across trials [5] .",
    "This has led to recommendations for selecting trials participants based on initial severity, which is usually based on scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [3] or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) [4] .",
    "Of the 19 studies with 6553 participants, we excluded 6 studies that enrolled only participants with MCI or normal cognitive function, 1 study that did not collect baseline MMSE data, and 3 studies that did not collect ADAS-Cog data, leaving 10 studies meeting these inclusion criteria.",
    "The primary test of interest was the significance of the group by time interaction, which would indicate that the slopes differed by MMSE category.",
    "Trials with duration less than 24 months would still be used in the estimation of the slope parameter by contributing data at the time points where observations were collected.",
    "Differences between groups at the conclusion of the trial reflected both differences in the baseline scores on the ADAS-Cog and differences in the rate of decline over the duration of the trial, with the former having a greater contribution than the latter.",
    "Of this, 14.1 points were due to differences present at baseline, leaving 7.1 points due to differences in slope over the trial period.",
    "Clinical assessments were done at 6-month intervals over the duration of each study (Table 1) .",
    "Findings: Baseline MMSE category was associated with baseline scores and rate of decline on the ADAS-Cog, adjusting for age and education (both P , .001).",
    "Baseline MMSE category was strongly associated with baseline ADAS-Cog scores (P , .001).",
    "Inclusion criteria for the present analysis were (1) diagnosis of dementia due to AD; (2) completed the MMSE at baseline; (3) completed at least one assessment on the ADAS-Cog.",
    "Annual rate of change represents the slope of the mixed effects model fitted to the sample with the specified baseline MMSE range, while sample size is the number of subjects in the metadatabase with the specified baseline MMSE range Several previous studies have shown an association between more severe cognitive impairment and rate of decline, but there are inconsistencies among these reports.",
    "Such results indicate that investigators should consider prospectively stratifying trials based on cognitive severity rather than enriching based on initial cognitive severity when attempting to improve AD trial design.",
    "This model found that baseline MMSE was closely associated with baseline ADAS-Cog scores and the rate of decline on the ADAS-Cog over time.",
    "Post hoc analyses from some AD clinical trials have shown more rapid progression of disease with more severe baseline impairment [2] , suggesting the possibility of a differential response to treatment.",
    "When enriching for more severe disease using baseline MMSE, a slightly larger slope (rate of decline) was observed but offset by a large reduction in the size of the available sample in the meta-database meeting the MMSE cutoff.",
    "However, these differences at the end of trials are primarily due to differences in baseline ADAS-Cog scores.",
    "Given the lack of success in trials of potential diseasemodifying and symptomatic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD), experts have recommended enriching trials with groups that are more likely to respond [1] .",
    "Any potential benefits of neuropsychological testing to enrich clinical trials samples must be balanced against the increased time and participant burden required in a screening process that includes such measures.",
    "The rate of change for each group would be the sum of the reference estimate (9.96 points/year for the most severe group) plus the estimate for the interaction, so that negative interaction terms indicate slower progression.",
    "These findings have significant implications for recommendations to enrich AD clinical trials based on initial severity.",
    "Participants with lower baseline MMSE categories tended to be older, less educated, and more likely to be female than those in higher categories (Table 2 ).",
    "Clinical trials in AD should not exclude participants based on the severity of cognitive impairment, but include the severity as a moderator of treatment effects in analysis.",
    "Enrichment using this criterion would select individuals with greater severity as being more likely to progress, which would be consistent with the larger slopes (and greater potential for slope reduction) seen in our analysis.",
    "An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the independence of the slope and intercept parameters.",
    "These opposing recommendations highlight the potential limitations with analysis of observational studies and post hoc failed therapeutic trials, which cannot give a definitive depiction of the effects of a successful treatment.",
    "Notably, individuals with greater baseline levels of cognitive impairment (as measured by the MMSE) had greater rates of progression on the ADAS-Cog than individuals with lesser baseline cognitive impairment."
