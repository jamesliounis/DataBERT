    "The first section of this paper",
    "Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin (2005) have generously provided us extracts from the data used in their study of the role of academic and nonacademic factors in admissions at a number of selective institutions.",
    "We rely on several data sources.",
    "1 Card and Krueger (1992) and authors' calculations from 2000 Census data.",
    "selective colleges and universities are calculated from the aforementioned Expanded College and Beyond data set, which describes the cohort entering college in the fall of 1995; we compute denominators for application rates by comparing these data to data on 1995 SAT-takers.",
    "Combining the two projections with a unique national data set on SAT test takers, we predict the distribution of black test scores relative to those of whites in future years.",
    "The policy question at the center of our empirical analysis is whether there will be enough black 4 These data are from the Expanded College and Beyond (ECB) study assembled by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and describe the 1995 admissions cycle.",
    "To incorporate this trend into our analysis, we simply add this many points to each black student's SAT score in the 2000 data, after re-weighting the data to reflect income convergence.",
    "Indeed, using the SAT data, we calculate that well over half of blacks with SATs above 1500 send their scores-a proxy for application-to Harvard alone.",
    "As one might infer from Figures 5 and 6, these projections are between the estimates with income convergence alone and those with both income and historical test score convergence, closing about 30% of the gap created by the shift to race-neutral admissions.",
    "The third section describes our methods and data and presents our forecasts of test score distributions and admissions outcomes 25 years from now.",
    "We use existing estimates of the speed of regression toward the mean income across generations to project the future black-white family income gap, and extrapolate from past trends in test score convergence between black and white students to project the conditional-on-income test score gap.",
    "Page 3 Our results represent a baseline expectation in the event that current trends continue, and are obviously sensitive to policy shifts that change relative outcomes of African American and white students.",
    "This is almost certainly too optimistic, as the entire gain over the last 25 years occurred in the first ten years of that period; more recent data indicate a growing black-white test-score gap.",
    "That is, we assume that black students who currently attend the best schools attended by black 11 The regression includes full interactions of individual gender, race, and 13 family income dummies and of race with 100 (10 mother's by 10 father's) parental education dummies.",
    "The results are illustrated in Table 3 .",
    "Table 2 presents an identical analysis under the assumption that black application rates come to resemble those seen today among whites with similar SAT scores.",
    "While it is between-group convergence that is the focus of our analysis, most current estimates of the intergenerational transmission of income derive from samples of blacks and whites, and assume no distinction between within-group and between-group parameters.",
    "The second row of the table shows the black share of admissions under the \"race neutral\" counterfactual, in which the observed white admission profile is applied to both blacks and whites.",
    "The last two rows of the table present estimates of the representation of black students relative to white students under the alternative counterfactual of school integration (or of equalization in school quality).",
    "If it is not, CBAA will 15 If the elimination of affirmative action causes black application rates to become like those of whites, the appropriate comparison is of row 1 in Table 1 to rows 2 through 8 of Table 2. be a blunt tool for achieving racial diversity.",
    "Our re-assignment has the effect of closing the black-white gap in mean scores (in the income-reweighted data) by 30 points, the gap in median scores by 34, and the gap at the 90 th percentile by 24.",
    "At each SAT score, black students currently are substantially more likely than are whites to apply to the most selective institutions (see Figure 7 , using the institutional data).",
    "This indicates that mean regression can go on 6 We have also estimated our projections using as the relevant universe families with one member between the ages of 36 and 50, with similar results.",
    "As Figure 1 indicates, essentially all of the progress over the last twenty five years in NAEP scores occurred in the 1980s, and the gap grew during the 1990s.",
    "Our projections of the future black income distribution (relative to whites), then, are obtained by inflating the income of each black family in the 2000 data by 32%\n(=ln(1+0.38)).",
    "We construct a crude estimate of quality as the school fixed effect in a regression of SAT scores on a rich vector of student background characteristics.",
    "The first section of this paper outlines the racial gap in outcomes at the elementary and secondary levels.",
    "Our approach to projecting the pool of applicants to selective colleges and universities takes into consideration expected changes in the relative distributions of black and white family incomes and in the pre-collegiate achievement of black and white youth over the next quarter century.",
    "Our results represent a baseline expectation in the event that current trends continue, and are obviously sensitive to policy shifts that change relative outcomes of African American and white students.",
    "Trends at the 90 th percentile of the black and white distributions, perhaps more relevant for admission to selective colleges, are similar to those at the mean.",
    "Estimates of the correlation of income or wealth across generations at the family level are within the same range (Chadwick and Solon, 2002; Solon, 2002) .",
    "To implement the \"integration\" approach, we match corresponding percentiles of the black, white, and overall school quality distributions, and re-assign the overall quality distribution to both blacks and whites.",
    "7 Hertz (2005) argues that persistent poverty among very low income black families drags down estimates of intergenerational mean reversion, suggesting that pooled estimates may overstate between-group convergence.",
    "We begin by projecting the relative distributions of black and white family income, which are likely to converge somewhat in coming years.",
    "For each institutional composite, we show the share of the gap between current representation of black students and that which would be seen with race-neutral admissions that our projected income-driven convergence would close.",
    "Confidentiality requirements prevent a more disaggregated presentation.",
    "Our most hopeful simulations assume that, conditional on income, black students' scores relative to white students' will rise at the same rate over the next quarter century as a linear trend fit to the 1970-1998 experience.",
    "Our approach ascribes both peer groups and any other school-level components of test score variation to school quality (Rothstein, 2004) .",
    "Still, by examining average admissions probabilities among groups defined by important determinants, like SAT scores, it is possible to get an idea of the roles of race and academic qualifications in admissions.",
    "Table 1 presents simulations based on the assumption that black application behavior remains as it is today.",
    "(corresponding to a gap of 54%, or about $13,000, at the mean) in that year, so the above assumptions imply that it will shrink by about 0.38 log points over the next quarter century.",
    "The black-white gap in test scores among children with the same family incomes is large (Jencks and Phillips, 1998) but mutable.",
    "Unfortunately, we lack data on family income in earlier years.",
    "We implement this by assigning the admission profile observed for whites to blacks, in effect assuming that both black and white students will face the admission probabilities indicated by the solid line in Figure 2 .",
    "However, because black students are only moderately overrepresented among the additional students admitted under income-based preferences, and because the students brought in under these preferences comprise only a small share of the baseline class, the effect on total black representation is relatively modest.",
    "These shares are shown in rows (4) and (5) of Table 1 , first without and then with expected income convergence (which may involve some double counting, as part of past test score convergence may be attributable to income changes).",
    "Our SAT sample records students' self-reports of their family income in 13 categories, so we compute re-weighting factors from the census data for each of these categories to represent the projected family income distribution.",
    "Row 3 of Table 1 applies the same race-neutral admissions rule to the first counterfactual SAT distribution, assuming income convergence but no additional progress in test scores.",
    "8 This example is from Krueger (2003) ."
