    "9 The estimates of distortions for peer countries have been taken from Sinha (2016).",
    "The tables below summarizes the findings when the quantitative exercises of section 3.2 are repeated using the alternative values of the parameters.",
    "The most recent year for which data is available is 2011, which is used to arrive at the labor share of 0.51 for Bangladesh.",
    "The PWT 8.1 data is available for the period 1990 -2010.",
    "The most recent year for which data is available from the PWT 8.1 is 2011 which is used to calculate the specified value of capital-to-output ratio.",
    "A TFP index for the country is calculated using the data and methodology listed in PWT 8.1 and using the labor share of 0.51 obtained from the GTAP database.",
    "This can also be seen by comparing the five year average rates shown in table below to the corresponding table presented in section 3.1.",
    "This discussion is a summary of the survey on productivity by.",
    "The labor share of income for Bangladesh as sourced from the GTAP database is close but somewhat lower compared to the mean/median of lower-middle income countries for which the data is available in the PWT 8.1.",
    "For the benchmark exercise, the labor share of income was assumed to be 51 percent which was sourced from the GTAP database and the depreciation rate was picked to be 3.2 percent which was sourced from the PWT 8.1.",
    "In order to quantitatively analyze the growth prospects of Bangladesh, I use a version of the World Bank's LTGM which is an extension of the Solow (1956) -Swan (1956) growth models and is based on Hevia and Loayza (2012).",
    "Next, I move on to the robustness of findings in section 3.2 in which the model was used to solve for required investment share of GDP to deliver the chosen path of GDP growth.",
    "The quantitative findings from these studies can be used to discipline the parameter governing the efficiency of public investment .",
    "The total effective investment is given by (9) There are many studies that have studied the efficiency of public sector (for example Afonso, Ludger Schuknecht and Tanzi (2005, 2010) etc.).",
    "Afonso, Ludger Schuknecht and Tanzi (2010) report that for the sample countries, the same level of public sector output can be produced using 41 percent less resources on average.",
    "The trend in distortions captures the trend in marginal productivity gaps seen in the previous table.",
    "In order to test the sensitivity of the main results of the model, I repeat the quantitative exercises with a higher value of labor share of income.",
    "The results of the simulation are shown in the following figures.",
    "The table below shows the marginal productivity in industry and services relative to agriculture for Bangladesh which have been computed using labor shares of income at sector level from the GTAP database.",
    "The first set of results refers to the benchmark exercise followed by simulations with other alternatives for labor share.",
    "The following table compares the findings of section 3.1 when alternative values of labor share of income are used for quantitative analysis.",
    "The LTGM is developed as a spreadsheet-based tool and comes pre-populated with data for most countries.",
    "In this section I conduct robustness checks on the main quantitative findings of the model with respect to two important parameters -the labor share of income and the depreciation rate of physical capital .",
    "The efficiency of public investment for Bangladesh is assumed to be a bit lower than the mean efficiency at 55 percent, owing to the fact that the developing countries in the sample have lower efficiency rates.",
    "In the robustness exercises, I show how alternative values of affect the results of the analysis.",
    "The robustness result for section 2.3 follow the same pattern as discussed above and has been left out for the sake of brevity.",
    "The interested reader should read the paper as the discussion here highlights only some of the important factors that can lead to productivity growth and is in no way provides a comprehensive listing of such factors.",
    "The PWT 8.1 reports the index based on the Barro-Lee method that takes into account both the years of schooling as well as returns on education.",
    "The figure below compares the labor share of income of Bangladesh to the mean/median labor shares of lower-middle income countries obtained from PWT 8.1 for the year 2011.",
    "Bridgman, Qi and Schmitz (2009) find that the sugar yield per ton of beet which was on the upward trend till the act passed started declining post the passage of law.",
    "The aggregate participation rate rose from approximately 45 percent in the mid-1970s to over 60 percent in the 2010s, largely due to a massive jump in the female labor force participation rate, which grew from a low base of 12 percent in 1989 to 30 percent in 2013.",
    "This point is illustrated in the graph below which shows the average GDP per capita growth rate during 2011 -2015 against the average investment share during the same period for more than 200 countries for which data is available from the World Development Indicators database.",
    "The aggregate participation rate is the weighted average of the male and the female participation rates.",
    "The calibrated model is then used to perform several quantitative exercises that feature different scenarios on how the drivers of growth evolve over time.",
    "Source: World Development Indicators total population in 1980, the working age population share grew by more than 13 percentage points in the last 35 years.",
    "In the next section, I examine the quantitative impact of one such factormore efficient allocation of existing resources across sectors.",
    "The following table summarizes the growth outcomes under various scenarios.",
    "In their analysis of US retail sector, Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2006) show that the growth of aggregate industrial productivity is derived in most part by the replacement of inefficient firms by the highly productive national chains.",
