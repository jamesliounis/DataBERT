    "(1) Source: Authors' analysis based on data described in the text.",
    "Source: Authors' analysis based on data sources discussed in the text.",
    "Detailed results are available from the authors.",
    "This is the question addressed in this paper.",
    "(2008) and Arkolakis et al.",
    "(2008) , which is relevant for our sample period.",
    "The next section surveys the literature to highlight our contribution.",
    "The data come from the above-mentioned CEPII database.",
    "Therefore, to perform this investigation, we rely on the NTM dataset used by Disdier et al.",
    "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
    "In their study using disaggregated data, Chen and Mattoo (2008) use standards harmonization in adjacent industries (i.e., industries classified in the same two-digit sector) as an instrument.",
    "Column (6) controls for the potential bias associated with fixed effects estimation on data pooled over consecutive years (Anderson and Yotov 2011) .",
    "We tried a cross-check with our data.",
    "The results are reported in Table 2 .",
    "The existing literature (see, among others, Czubala et al.",
    "Their study provides rich information.",
    "We use the template provided by Piermartini and Budetta (2009) and update it by adding some recent North-South EIAs that they did not review.",
    "Piermartini and Budetta (2009) survey 58 EIAs with TBT provisions.",
    "These statistics provide the number of North-South EIAs and the share of Northern imports from the South covered by these EIAs in 1990 EIAs in , 1999 EIAs in , and 2006 : Northern imports from the South.",
    "Column (7) uses only three-year interval data (1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006) to avoid the potential bias associated with fixed effects estimations on data pooled over consecutive years.",
    "Using detailed firm-level data, he shows that the harmonization of the EU's electronics standards on international ones in the 1990s induced entry by new US exporters, making the market more competitive and encouraging trade (in this case, with a Northern non-member).",
    "Columns (3)-(8) focus on country pairs that signed an EIA.",
    "The last three columns of Table 2 investigate the robustness of our results by replicating the estimation of column 4.",
    "As mentioned by Berger et al.",
    "There is abundant literature on the standards divide (Wilson and Abiola 2003) that indicates the potential detrimental effects of high-income countries' standards on exports from developing economies (Otsuki et al.",
    "Before turning to estimation results, we briefly report descriptive statistics showing the expansion of North-South EIAs over the 1990-2006 period.",
    "The first two columns follow a standard approach in the literature and test for the mean effect of North-South agreements on North-South trade without distinguishing between forms of integration.",
    "# : The last column reports the total effect of EIA and harmonization by summing the values of the coefficients on the dummy for the concurrent year and on the lagged dummy.",
    "The dataset provides all NTMs notified by WTO members at the WTO up to 2004 at the HS6-digit level.",
    "These columns test for the effect of deeper integration with the introduction of the dummies described in the previous section.",
    "The specification used here is more consistent with theory and involves the use of fixed effects by importer, exporter, and year (Baldwin and Taglioni 2006; Feenstra 2004) .",
    "The RESET test (Ramsey 1969 ) performed on our data suggests the presence of heteroskedasticity in our sample.",
    "Estimated coefficients on the interaction terms are reported in Table 4 .",
    "Although this approach offers a better understanding of the determinants of trade flows, it provides biased estimates in the presence of heteroskedasticity in trade data (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2009) .",
    "Regarding EIA variables, the interest of columns (1) and (2) is to highlight how the replacement of time-invariant importer and exporter effects by interacted importer-year, exporter-year, and country-pair effects affects estimates.",
    "The trade data come from the BACI database developed by the CEPII.",
    "This result highlights the presence of the type of trade deflection discussed in this paper.",
    "As stressed in Section 3, most of the EIAs containing a harmonization clause and included in our database involve the EU.",
    "The overall fit of the regressions is consistent with what is found in the literature.",
    "In addition, our data are aggregated, which reduces the proportion of zeroes in our sample.",
    "where n it and p it are the number of varieties and prices in country i in year t, Y jt , and P jt is the expenditure and price index of country j in year t. T ijt represents the iceberg transport costs in year t.",
    "Section 4 presents our econometric specification and data.",
    "We thank A. Sapir for providing data.",
    "In this paper, we limit our analysis to trade patterns and refrain from drawing welfare implications.",
    "Following Redding and Venables (2004) , the total value x ijt of exports from country i to country j in year t can be written as follows:",
    "Interestingly, the dummy variable controlling for the existence of a South-South EIA becomes significant, suggesting that South-South integration-long characterized by low complementarities and little trade creation-has significant trade effects in our sample period.",
    "The signature of an EIA involving the harmonization of its standards with the North has a negative and significant impact on its trade with other Southern countries, and the magnitude of the impact is similar to the one appearing in the previous column when it is not interacted with the harmonization dummy (if both are introduced simultaneously, the effect of standards harmonization absorbs that of a NS EIA for the exporter).",
    "The performance of the Poisson estimator has been challenged in the literature on the grounds that Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) do not consider the case in which the dependent variable has a substantial proportion of zero values.",
    "We report the total trade effect by summing coefficients on the contemporaneous and lagged dummies, with standard errors computed using the Delta method.",
    "Results are available upon request."
