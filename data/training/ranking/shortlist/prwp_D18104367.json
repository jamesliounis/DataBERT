    "This paper is an attempt to provide an analytical foundation for such an amendment.",
    "More recent literature has formalized this \"value of access\".",
    "(Arnott and Stiglitz, 1991) .",
    "as a result of family ties.14 A lacuna in that paper, however, is that it is simply assumed that the members of the group can ensure that others behave appropriately, i.e.",
    "There is mounting evidence that the costs on the defaulting nation are huge and prolonged (see, for instance, Cruces and Trebesch, 2011) .",
    "19 There is a large literature on the (Pareto) efficiency of markets in which a moral hazard problem of the kind we have just described arises.",
    "This was the requirement that R be sufficiently large for our solution to work.",
    "(See Arnott and Stiglitz, 1991) The Basic Model",
    "The aim of this paper is to illustrate one which is of great contemporary relevance by using tools of modern theoretical economics.",
    "\"17 See, for instance, 'IMF's Greek apology shows a bankruptcy code is needed,' by Komal Sri-Kumar (Financial Times, June 22, 2013, p. 22).18 It is interesting to see the Economist magazine (June 15-21, 2013, p. 14) refer directly to the \"moral hazard\" problem in the context of Germany and the weaker nations of the Eurozone as the stumbling block",
    "Before going into the construction of the formal model, it may be useful to sketch out the argument in words.",
    "See also Bolton and Jeanne (2011) .",
    "21 This is distinct from another form of inefficiency widely discussed in the international debt literature, that associated with 'loan pushing' (Darity and Horn, 1986; Basu and Morita, 2006) .",
    "The aim of this paper is to construct a theoretical model to illustrate the nature of inefficiency that arises from the limited liability of nations and how this can be mitigated by bringing a more economically resourceful nation into a certain kind of joint liability.",
    "(R \u2212 (\u03b4 + [1 \u2212 p(e * )], A \u2212 (R \u2212 (\u03b4 + [1 \u2212 p(e * )]).",
    "At a more general level this paper is concerned with international policy coordinationthough in the model attention is restricted to a special case of this, to wit, one involving banking, investment and sovereign debt.",
    "The paper does not go into institutional details of how this may be done but constructs a theoretical model to motivate such a legal-institutional change.",
    "This is an example of an information externality, where monitoring by one party conveys information to another.",
    "For a more recent discussion of joint liability in lending, seeGhatak and Guinnane (1999).15 There is a related concept in which bank monitoring (not quite a peer) provides information to capital markets, where monitoring is weak.",
    "Assume there is a joint project whose return is positively correlated with the success of i's project, such that if e < e * , EA \u2212 R + (\u03b4 + [1 \u2212 p(e * )]) < 0.",
    "(See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) ).",
    "28 See Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003) .",
    "The paper is written in an abstract form, to lay bare as clearly as possible, the microeconomic basis and game-theoretic structure of our argument.",
    "This is an area where market failures and inefficiencies are common in the best of times(Basu, 1991; Stiglitz, 2002a).2 See in particular Stiglitz (forthcoming).",
    "Suppose j has close trading and business relation with a large nation, such as Germany, that we shall here refer to as nation k. This country being close to j can also observe the effort that j puts into the hydro power project.",
    "14 15 This paper goes beyond these earlier studies by identifying a contractual relationship which leads to a sub-game perfect equilibrium which is a Pareto improvement.",
    "22 It is possible that j and k belong to the same currency union, as in the case with Germany and Cyprus or they 22 The idea of how an uninvolved third party can alter the relation between two economic agents has had a long, if somewhat sporadic, history (see, for instance, Akerlof, 1976; Basu 1986 Basu , 2000 Hatlebakk, 2002; Villanger, 2005) .",
    "In this section we illustrate the working of our model for a special case, to wit, one in which most choices are binary.",
    "p (0)(X \u2212 D) \u2264 c < p (0)X",
    "The aim of this paper is to outline new strategies that can make international lending across nations that are inter-connected, such as the current European Union nations, more efficient and robust.",
    "If k does not pull out of the project, its return is A \u2212 R + \u03b4 + [1 \u2212 p(e * )]).",
    "9 That is the central message of this paper.",
    "However, as noted in section 5, while this assumption is convenient for exposition, it is not really necessary for country k to be able to observe country j's effort.",
    "And R can be sufficiently large, if A is sufficiently large.",
    "This paper shows that the answer is yes and it also illustrates the design of a contract that can achieve this.",
    "If one shows (as we will in this paper) that people can do better by behaving differently, mainstream economists are prone to argue that that there must be a flaw in the analysis because if people could have done better behaving differently (e.g.",
    "To focus on the interesting case suppose the parameters above are such that the following two conditions hold:",
    "In particular, It is now possible to show that if values of A and R that occurs in the Nash equilibrium are sufficiently large, then this game can be used strategically to yield efficiency in the bilateral lending game between j and k. This entails the use of joint debt liability.",
    "It is useful to confront a possible mainstream, neoclassical criticism at the outset.",
    "Even if we can understand his misinformation about the color of blood since evidence on that would have been a little harder to collect in those ancient times, it is baffling why he could not ask a sample of fellow Athenians or Macedonians to open their mouths for a quick statistical check of the dental asymmetry hypothesis.4 Countries do not, of course, literally go bankrupt.",
    "Assuming that the cost of each unit of effort is c, country j then faces the following problem.",
    "In Figure 1 , the horizontal axis represents the effort, e, put in by the borrowing country.",
    "To see this consider another country k with which j has a lot of interaction-trade or capital flows or joint ventures-and mutual gain.",
    "19 And this raises the question, is there a design that can recover this lost efficiency?",
    "There are examples galore of the need for purposive inter-country coordinated and preplanned behavior.",
    "In case anybody takes this to go to the other extreme of ignoring evidence while making policy, we should warn against the pitfalls of this by reminding the reader of the most celebrated case of ignoring evidence, namely, Aristotle's steadfast belief that women have blacker blood than men and also fewer teeth, and basing many gendered suggestions on this \"fundamental difference.\"",
    "There is a pre-commitment problem.",
    "The probability of the project being successful is p and we will assume that p depends on the effort, e, that the borrower, namely, country j, puts in: p = p(e), p (e) > 0, p (e) < 0.",
    "The value of this access is sufficiently high that it is assumed that members of the group will not renege.)",
    "It is however laid out in full and conveys the basic idea of our model."
