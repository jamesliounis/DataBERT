    "This paper used the Total Federal transfers for Secondary Education provided by SEP.",
    "The simulation first calculates the supplementary funding requirement of each state, applying the same parameters described in table 2 (in the appendix) to the number of rural, indigenous, and poor children living in each of the 31 states.",
    "This paper used the national population of 12 to 14 years old, as computed by CONAPO.",
    "Lopez-Acevedo (1999a) shows that differences in enrollment elasticity among states can be significant at lower secondary education (see table 1 in the annex ).",
    "The first simulation (Table 1 ) asks the question: What would be the pattern of allocation of Federal transfers for lower secondary education among states, if Formula I (uniform per-student or capitation method) were used, and how would it compare with the actual allocation?",
    "This paper is organized as follow: Section II introduces the three competing formulas.",
    "For illustrative purposes, it is used the 12 to 14 Age-group estimates provided by CONAPO.",
    "A similar exercise was undertaken, using Formula II (productivity adjusted formula).",
    "Section III discusses the simulations.",
    "Enrollment elasticities with respect to per child transfers were computed for each state, using probit regression equations (see table 1 in the appendix), The results indicate that contrary to the usual concern previously mentioned, application of a uniform per-student formula in Mexico would tend to redistribute Federal transfers from high to low income states.",
    "The implication is that since by design Formula II gives more to states whose enrollment elasticity is higher, equity and efficiency objectives coincide, as earlier hypothesized.",
    "This paper shows that three formulae appear promising for the purpose of establishing an improved formula-driven interstate and intrastate allocation: i) uniform per student formula: simplest and most transparent; rewards enrollment, but does not explicitly address differential needs of states.",
    "Compute the relative magnitude of the enrollment elasticity in state i (RALPHi) in relation to that of a \"reference state\".",
    "To answer this question, the states were classified into three categories, depending on the size of their net gain per student.",
    "As mentioned, econometric analyses of Mexican data strongly suggest that doing so would improve not only equity but also efficiency.",
    "It requires systematic experimentation.",
    "The elasticity used is the highest in the range of elasticties across the Mexican states -states with elasticity of a similar magnitude included Guerrero, Hidalgo, Nayarit and San Luis Potos\u00ed.",
    "Simulations show that adoption of any of the above formulae would tend to improve distribution in favor of low income and educationally lagging states.",
    "\u2729 Based on Probits of Enrollment of Secondary School Aged Children using ENIGH 1994.",
    "Divide the given total amount of Federal transfer for the relevant educational level by total enrolment to get per student Federal expenditure for the country as a whole (EXPT).",
    "Besides, empirical results from PARE (Lopez-Acevedo, 1999c ) indicate that intervention programs like it have produced rates of improvement among children with initially low learning achievement (specifically, indigenous students) that were remarkably higher than the average student.",
    "where SHAREi is the share of state i in total enrollment for the relevant educational level\".",
    "Section IV has the conclusions.",
    "In other words, the states with the lowest enrollment rates are likely to show the largest gains for each additional peso of federal subsidy and thus should be favored, if higher overall enrollments and assistance to poorer states are the goals.",
    "1 It also shows that given the current pattern of coverage, states which lag behind in enrollment rate and income tend to have higher elasticities.",
    "It can be shown that under this situation, if the Government is aiming at maximizing enrollment, it should adjust the per student formula by factors reflecting the elasticity of enrollment with respect to the Federal subsidy of one state relative to that of another.",
    "the above multi-component formula), special matching grants program can be a useful tool for motivating local resource mobilization.",
    "These figures indicate the size of the adjustment that needs to be made by the losers and the amount of assistance that they would require to ease the transition.",
    "This implies that under this formula those lagging states would be given relatively more Federal transfers per child.",
    "This paper is limited to addressing questions of interstate allocation of Federal education transfers that can be used more effectively in promoting equity, efficiency and resource mobilization.",
    "That is, RALPHi is equal to ALPHAi divided by the ALPHA of the reference state (Distrito Federal in this paper).",
    "EXTRAi = CCOST1*RURi + CCOST2*INDi + CCOST3*POORi 6.",
    "This is an important issue to consider in light of the need to mobilize additional resources for the education sector and the decline in states' contribution to its finance.",
    "Finally, to estimate the number of poor children, the marginality index of CONAPO was used, since it is not possible to get statespecific poverty rates based on income",
    "Note that these are point elasticities, evaluated at the mean of federal transfers and enrollment probability for each state, but in the estimation of additional funding, the elasticity is assumed to be constant over the 10% and 20% intervals used as the two scenarios.",
    "Using this distribution, the budget for compensatory programs (22 percent of primary education Federal transfers) is accordingly divided among the states.",
    "A simulated application of this formula reveals, however, that its use can in fact improve the current situation in regard to equity (see below).",
    "Second, the approach suffers from the same criticisms mentioned above about the use of input-based incentives and allocation formula.",
    "Application of Formulae I and II at the primary level would mean losses of about 2.25 billion (1998) pesos for 17 to 19 states (Table 4) .",
    "The formula applies a simple distribution of federal resources in direct proportion to the number of eligible students in a state, i.e., the population of children of school-going age.",
    "It can be shown that enrollment is maximized if a state is allocated an amount that is proportional to its enrollment elasticity with respect to federal education spending.",
    "The simulation results presented in Table 3 clearly show that like the other formulae, Formula III would also improve equity.",
    "Define ZETAi = RALPHi * SHAREi and ZETAT = the sum of ZETAi over all states i except the \"reference state\".",
    "II) Productivity adjusted per student formula: maximizes enrollment impact by giving more to states with high enrollment elasticity to subsidy; no equity assurance but at this stage of Mexico's development, it can be favorable to disadvantaged states since they now tend to have higher enrollment elasticities.",
    "The size of this effect is not known empirically.",
    "Get estimates of enrollment elasticity for each state i (ALPHAi).",
    "Step 2 : Compute the share of each state i in the national population of the children of schoolgoing age.",
    "The unconstrained extra amount of resources (EXTRAi) needed by a state i to reduce the learning gap caused by these three sources of disadvantage can be estimated as",
    "The second is the supplemental component consisting of additional funding to states, depending on the population of special groups which are in need of additional resources to compensate for the cost of reducing their disadvantages relative to the average group of children.",
    "This is likely to show that the total extra resources needed is greater than the total available supplemental budget.(SUPBUD)."
