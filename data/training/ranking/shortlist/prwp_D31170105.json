    "These datasets are described in the following section.",
    "These are based on a readily available dataset created for use at the global scale (Zorn and Koks, 2019) using a calibrated geospatial prediction model (Zhu, Baise and Thompson, 2017) .",
    "In this report, we make use of an accurate dataset to identify the number and locations of Chinese wastewater treatment plants exposed to changing probabilities flooding in the context of climate change, as well as those plants that are exposed to significant earthquakes.",
    "These are based on a readily available dataset created for use at the global scale using a calibrated geospatial prediction model.",
    "We present detailed methodology below.",
    "The dataset contains full name of the treatment plant, daily capacity, actual amount of wastewater treated and city information.",
    "We firstly assemble a data set for wastewater treatment works (2,743 assets) from the Chinese Ministry of the Environment (Ministry of the Environment, 2013).",
    "Using the known WWTPs in the supplied dataset, we further estimate the population dependent on the w th plant, Cw, as:",
    "A recently developed Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR) is also incorporated into it (Yamazaki et al., 2011) .",
    "(2013), inTable S1.2 For most of the AOGCMs, the period is 2006-2100.",
    "For each grid-cell within each AOGCM, we extract the annual maxima river water depth of the period 1970-1999 to quantify the Gumbel distribution parameters, which represent extreme value statistics for the late 20 th century.",
    "Given the myriad of data that is required to carry out a detailed analysis at each WWTP site, we instead adopt two readily available measures to provide a proxy for estimating asset damage.",
    "Regardless, this method has shown promising predictive capacity and is adopted in a number of national and global applications (Lin et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019) (Lin et al.",

    "This analysis is undertaken for changing flooding, under climate scenarios, and earthquake exposure of a spatially accurate wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) database for China, covering a total of 1,346 assets with additional attributes quantifying the treatment capacity and users dependent on each plant.",

    "Based on the Gumbel distribution parameters of the baseline period (Hu et al., 2016, Section 3.4 .1), we calculate the 'equivalent' river water depth of the baseline for each AOGCM as a way of reducing bias.",
    "Further to this analysis, we calculate the number of users each WWTP asset serves, according to population and usage data.",
    "From these outcomes, we extract the flood extent for return periods greater than 1 in 100 years, 1 in 50 years and 1 in 30 years and produce the mean flood inundation map for 2016-2035 and 2036-2055 at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively.",
    "PGA hazard maps are for return periods of 250-, 475-, 950-, 1500 250-, 475-, 950-, -, and 2475 250-, 475-, 950-, -years (UNISDR, 2015 .",
    "The counts of these and potential affected users within each PGA and liquefaction susceptibility class are presented in Tables 1 and 2 .",
    "For the AOGCMs, we adopt a historic and future period (2006-2100 2 ) at representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 (Stocker et al., 2013) .",
    "This paper describes the methodology and findings for the extreme hazard exposure analysis of the Chinese wastewater sector to flooding and earthquakes hazards.",
    "Further example spatial distributions for 250-and 2475-year return periods are shown in Figure 8 .",
    "RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 are part of a new set of scenarios used in the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase of the World Climate Research Programme.",
    "where , is the daily volume treated in 10,000 m 3 for waste treatment plant w in county b; Vb is the total waste water treated for county b; and is the population of county b.",
    "When considering shaking in isolation (rows), as one could expect, greater numbers of WWTPs (and dependent populations) are exposed to higher shaking classes with greater return period events.",
    "Time period (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) to (2016-2035) is shown in Figures 5a and 5b whereas time period (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) to (2036-2055) is shown in Figures 5c and 5d .",
    "Firstly, we apply and downscale the CaMa-Flood model for 21 st century China for RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5 at return periods greater than 30, 50 and 100 respectively.",
    "The full list of AOGCMs is available in the supplementary materials section of Hirabayashi et al.",
    "\uf0b7 Spatially we observe that in the near future, flood hazards for RCP 4.5 are concentrated along the Yangtze River, in southern Hubei, northern Hunan, central Anhui, northern Jiangxi and Shanghai, all of which are highly populated and the WWTPs here serve high numbers of users.",
    "In some cases, we do not have population data for counties therefore our user sample of WWTPs is reduced to 891.",
    "Here we subtract the inundation value for each grid (spatial resolutions: 2.5 min x 2.5 min) and estimate the total flooded area between period 1 as defined by the difference between 1986-2005 and 2016-2035, and period 2 as defined by the difference between 1986-2005 and 2036-2055, for both pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.",
    "For instance, the highest from Model BCC-CSM1-1 projects the number of assets exposed to net increase flooding hazards is 472 and a potential 17.5 million users could be affected for RCP 4.5 at return period 30 by 2035.",
    "For each particular grid cell, \u210e , we first estimate the change in flood fraction \u2206 between the representative time period (e.g.",
    "Time period: (1986-2005) to (2036-2055) Second, the spatial variation is extremely important for planning climate resilient infrastructure as exposure of infrastructures to natural hazards is highly location-sensitive.",
    "However, this number varies depending on the individual model and return periods examined.",
    "We then validate this dataset with Google Satellite Images to verify their exact locations.",
    "\uf0b7 Under RCP4.5 emission scenarios, 10 out of 11 climate models are in complete agreement of a net increase in plant exposure numbers and users impacts for all flood exceedance probabilities in the near future.",
    "Based on these results, we then compute how the probability of flooding may change for specified geographical locations in China and superimpose the wastewater assets we collected onto the changing flood hazard maps.",
    "\uf0b7 Under RCP8.5 emission scenarios, 9 out of 11 climate models are in complete agreement of a net increase in plant exposure numbers and user impacts for all flood exceedance probabilities in the near future.",
    "These combined PGA/liquefaction susceptibility classifications as indicated by their colour shading are collated in Figure 7 (excluding dark green).",
    "With these parameters, we estimate the return period of the annual maxima for 1970-2100 and 1970-2099.",
    "Combined PGA and liquefaction susceptibility classes for the color scheme given in Table 3 and Figure 7 across 250-and 2475-year return period PGA events.",
    "As these were created at the global scale, we note that they may underestimate the hazard in local areas for fault lines not captured in historical catalogues.",
    "This is similarly reflected in Figure 6 where a large concentration of WWTPs service the east coast provinces surrounding Shanghai, Beijing, and other major urban centers.",
    "flood fraction 0 to 1.0) for each AOGCM (spatial resolutions: 2.5 min x 2.5 min) (Hu et al., 2015) .",
    "Overall, we see few WWTPs located in areas with High classifications of PGA shaking -ranging from 0 to 5% of our data across the studied return periods.",
    "To demonstrate this, we select WWTPs and superimpose changing flooding hazard maps for return period > 50, varying RCP and time period for model MPI-ESM-LR ( Figure 5 ).",
    "It calculates river channel storage, floodplain storage, river discharge, river water depth, and inundated area for each grid cell at a spatial resolution of 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0."
