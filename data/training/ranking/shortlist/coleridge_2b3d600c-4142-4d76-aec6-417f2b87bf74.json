    "The paper is structured as follows.",
    "Using the CCMP dataset to study climatic trends at global and regional scale (Zheng et al., 2016) , at least in the Mediterranean area, is therefore questionable.",
    "The wind dataset extends from July 1987 to July 2015, the sea surface temperature dataset from 1981 to November 2016, the sea surface height dataset from January 1993 to December 2016.",
    "This is 20 likely to be a bias of the dataset, caused by inhomogeneities in the assimilation procedure used to merge the ERA-Interim first guess with observations (Ross Hoffman, personal communication) .",
    "With this work we perform this analysis exploiting high resolution observational datasets for surface winds, sea surface temperature and sea surface height.",
    "See Appendix A for a more in depth discussion on this issue.",
    "In Section 20 3 we discuss the results of this analysis.",
    "In Section 2 we present the observational datasets and describe the statistical analysis we have performed in order to identify the intense wind events and evaluate their impact on the state of the upper ocean.",
    "Due to the non stationary number of observational data, observations tend to weight more in the estimate towards the end of the time period, while in the first part the ERA-Interim background field dominates the average.",
    "Additionally, we have compared these results with a 30 years long 15 run of the atmospheric regional model WRF in non-hydrostatic setup, at 4 Km horizontal resolution, forced with ERA-Interim data (Pieri et al., 2015) .",
    "For completeness, we report in fig.",
    "Furthermore, the wind dataset has a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and sea surface height have a time resolution of 1 day.",
    "In Section 4 we draw our conclusions and discuss the implications of our findings.",
    "We have therefore limited the analysis to the overlapping period 1993-2014.",
    "The relaxation time scale of the first recovery is about 40 days, computed by fitting with an exponential the SSTA composite average in the first 60 days after the maximum of the drop, and does not depend on the value of the threshold.",
    "Average KE appears to be stationary in ERA-Interim ( The presence of this spurious trend makes questionable to use the CCMP dataset for studying global and regional trends, at least in the Mediterranean region, despite having be used sometimes for this purpose in the recent past (e.g.",
    "This signal might be due to the fact that SST are provided daily in the OISST 5 dataset, but they have been obtained by performing a bias adjustment using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average, which might anticipate the temporal signal (Reynolds et al., 2007) .",
    "However, such signal appears not to be present in other observational dataset that are part of the assimilation process of the CCMP product.",
    "Having artificially weaker extreme winds in the first period of the dataset leads to miss events happening at earlier times, hence to have a poorer statistics overall, but does not affect our results otherwise.",
    "We define the average composite evolution of the area averaged observable at a time lag \u03c4 from the intense wind day as\nwhere the subscript w, s refers to the winter or summer occurrence of the event considered.",
    "As proposed in the cited works, the net long-term warming of the water column due to the action of the intense winds in the tropical regions can affect ocean heat transport and impact processes that depend on ocean heat content.",
    "Our work confirms from observational data that the signature of intense wind events on the state of the upper ocean in the region persists for weeks, and has the potential to influence air-sea processes on different time scales.",
    "Furthermore, the SST recovery time scale has been estimated on the scale of a couple of weeks (Sanford et al., 2007; Price et al., 2008; , as an effect of anomalous air-sea fluxes and mixed layer baroclinic instabilities associated with the front induced by the localized mixing (Boccaletti et al., 2007; Mei and Pasquero, 2012) .",
    "The aim of this work is to perform the same type of analysis in the Mediterranean Sea.",
    "Thanks to the fact that the SSHA is less noisy 10 than SSTA, it is more clear the appearance of an oscillation on a period of about 20 days, whose nature remains unclear, but whose presence appears ubiquitous in our composite analysis.",
    "They are produced from the SL-TAC multi-mission altimeter data processing system.",
    "The wind data have a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and height are provided daily.",
    "The first recovery period lasts for about 60 days, at the end of which the system has not yet properly reached a state that is zero compatibly with the error bars.",
    "We limit the analysis to the area characterized by u 95 > 15 ms , for a temporal 15 coordinate (t 6 ) and for at least one couple of spatial coordinates (\u03c6, \u03bb) within the region inside the closed solid line in fig.",
    "Similarly, air-sea coupling on sub-monthly time scale has been found to be important in the modulation of heavy precipitation events in this and other regions of the Mediterranean in a climatic modeling study (Berthou et al., 2016) .",
    "Each intense wind day is assigned to the winter or summer dataset depending on its date of occurrence, t i , with i = 1, .., N , and with N=N w , N s the total number of intense wind days in the winter and summer datasets, respectively.",
    "Therefore, statistical robustness is expected only for low values of the threshold.",
    "The effects of the enhanced enthalpy and momentum fluxes on the upper ocean is investigated using sea surface temperature and sea surface height observational data products in the period 1993-2014.",
    "The fact that surface thermal anomalies persist for at least 30 days, confirms thus the potential of (sub-)monthly scale feedbacks.",
    "These values correspond to 122 and 11 days featuring at least one intense event.",
    "The same feature has been observed in a similar analysis of the effect on SSHA of the passage of hurricanes in the Tropics (Supplementary Information in ), but to our knowledge no explanation has been given yet.",
    "We have remapped the sea surface height data on the coarser 0.25\u00b0grid of the winds and sea surface temperature by bilinear interpolation.",
    "Since we study the response of the state of the upper ocean to intense wind events, and since we can safely assume that the nature of this interaction has not changed with time, we only have a problem of loss of statistics rather than of biasing.",
    "Figure 1 shows u 95 (\u03c6, \u03bb), the 95th percentile of the local winter wind intensity u(\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 ) = | \u2212 \u2192 u (\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 )|.",
    "The error on the estimates given by equation 2 is computed as the standard deviation related to the sum involved in the formulas, divided by the square root of N w,s , the number of days in the considered region when at least one intense wind event has been recorded.",
    "In the previous version of the CCMP product (version 1.1, light blue) the trend is even stronger, as the estimate at later times is close to the estimate of the new product, while they 10 differ at the beginning of the time period.",
    "VAM combines RSS instrument data with moored buoy measurements and a starting estimate of the wind field, provided by the ERA-Interim reanalysis winds.",
    "The composite averaged winter and summer SSHA from 90 days before the event to 180 days after are shown in figures 3a and 3b, respectively.",
    "From the CCMP dataset we consider the instantaneous 6-hourly surface wind velocity vector \u2212 \u2192 u (\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 ) at latitude \u03c6, longi-10 tude \u03bb and time t 6 .",
    "2b also the results of the analysis relative to the summer months (June through August).",
    "It is unclear at present what is the magnitude of each of these mechanisms.",
    "The composite average of the time evolution of winter SSTA before and after the occurrence of intense wind events, computed for the different values of the threshold is shown in figure 2a .",
    "(red line of figure A1 ).",
    "Levantine Intermediate Water (MEDOC GROUP, 1970; Schott et al., 1994) .",
    "The average wind intensity over the Mediterranean region computed from the CCMP dataset shows a strong non-stationarity across the 1993-2014 period."
