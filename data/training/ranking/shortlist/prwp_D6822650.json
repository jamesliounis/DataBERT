    "The main results in this paper are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 The first (top) panel in Table 4 focuses on enrollment.",
    "Similar results are reported in Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd (2005) .",
    "To get a sense for the magnitude of the problem, we regressed enrollment on the log of total household expenditures, with expenditures instrumented with the measures of housing conditions and durables-see for example Glewwe and Jacoby (1995) and Behrman and Knowles (1999) for a similar approach.",
    "The analysis is based on an experimental design.",
    "The survey data were supplemented with data obtained from Banred on total BDH transfers collected by households in the sample between January 2004 and July 2005.",
    "This is the basis for the identification strategy in this paper.",
    "Note that this concern is not particular to this evaluation-it could be an issue for any evaluation of a program that requires beneficiaries to comply with certain conditions, and for which data are collected on the basis of household responses in a survey (for example , Schultz 2004, Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd 2005 , and Todd and Wolpin 2003 on PROGRESA;",
    "4 One possible concern with the analysis in this paper is the extent to which respondents might answer strategically during the survey.",
    "There is some evidence that this is the case.",
    "In a recent article in The Economist magazine the authors write that \"cash transfers, with strings attached, are a better way of helping the poor than many previous social programs\" (The Economist 2005) .",
    "On the other hand, a joint test shows that the age dummies are clearly significant (p-value: <0.001).6 In a similar regression that includes a dummy variable for baseline enrollment and the interaction between baseline enrollment and lottery winners, the coefficients on both variables are insignificant individually and jointly.",
    "In the full sample, the coefficient on conditioned households is 0.019 in the enrollment regression (with a robust standard error of 0.013), 0.010 (with a robust standard error of 0.026) in the child work regression, and -0.006 (with a robust standard error of 0.010) for the full-time employment regression.",
    "National identification numbers of respondents and other adults in the household were collected in the baseline and follow-up surveys, and the private banks in Banred provided data on the payments made to all persons with these identification numbers, on a monthly basis.",
    "Todd and Wolpin (2003) use data on PROGRESA, and Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Leite (2003) use data on the Brazilian Bolsa Escola program (now renamed Bolsa Familia) to simulate the impact of conditional and unconditional cash transfers; both papers conclude that the bulk of the enrollment effects are a result of the price change implicit in the condition, rather than the income effect associated with the cash transfer.",
    "To this effect, the government developed a composite welfare index on the basis of information on household composition, education levels, dwelling characteristics, and access to services, aggregated by principal components.",
    "Table 3 for a full list of controls.",
    "where Y it is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if child i is enrolled in school at the time of the follow-up survey (in the enrollment regressions) or working (in the child work regressions); \u03b1 c is a set of canton-level fixed effects; X it-1 is a vector of baseline child and household characteristics; Z i is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a family was a lottery winner; and \u03b5 it is the regression error term.",
    "The R-squared in this regression is 0.01, and an F-test fails to reject the null hypothesis of joint insignificance of all variables (p-value: 0.20).",
    "The main results in the paper are two.",
    "These values are comparable to those found in other developing countries-see the review in Behrman and Knowles (1997) .",
    "The table shows that children in households that received transfers were significantly more likely to be enrolled at baseline; fathers' education for treated households was 0.52 years higher, and mothers' education 0.60 years higher.",
    "The sample for the evaluation of the BDH program in this paper was drawn from the Selben rosters of four of the twenty-two provinces in the country: Carchi, Imbabura, Cotopaxi, and Tungurahua.",
    "This is very close to the coefficients in Table 4 , which suggests that replacing the age dummies with the continuous variable in age does not substantively alter the estimated effects.",
    "Approximately 54 percent of children in the control group were working at the time of the follow-up survey, a number that is about 8 percentage points higher than at baseline; once again, the ageing of the study population accounts for these patterns.",
    "A comparison of Tables 2 and 3 suggests that complier households have lower education levels and fewer members than the average household in our sample.",
    "The estimates of \u03b4 in regressions of enrollment and drop-outs are significant at conventional levels, while those for new enrollments are not significantly different from zeropresumably, because of smaller sample sizes.",
    "In making comparisons between the BDH and PROGRESA programs it is therefore important to correct for differences in the composition of the samples.Schultz (2004) reports PROGRESA program effects by single grade a child was enrolled at baseline.",
    "The table shows that the lottery effects on enrollment for conditioned households range from 0.073 to 0.130, while those for unconditioned households range from 0.014 to 0.021, and are insignificant.",
    "Rather, it is based on comparisons between Bono Solidario recipients and non-recipients in the 1998/99 Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida (ECV), a nationally representative household survey, and may therefore be subject to biases associated with endogenous program placement or take-up.",
    "13 The reported CLAD estimates are based on regressions with the full set of controls, with a continuous variable in age instead of the age fixed effects; the reason for this is that we had convergence problems when we included either the age dummies or the canton fixed effects.",
    "We then discarded from the sample of unconditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was below the 10 th percentile of the sample of conditioned households; similarly, we discarded from the sample of conditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was above the 90 th percentile of the sample of unconditioned households.",
    "Specifically, we regressed the probability of being conditioned on the extended set of controls and canton fixed effects, and predicted the probability that a household was conditioned.",
    "To date, what evidence there is on this point has relied on simulations, not on differences in the way cash transfer programs have been implemented or perceived by beneficiaries (Todd and Wolpin 2003; Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Leite 2003) .",
    "In a simple regression of enrollment on a dummy variable for attrited households, with standard errors corrected for within-sibling correlation, the coefficient is -0.083, with a robust standard error of 0.038.",
    "The enrollment regressions, work regressions and fulltime work regressions include the extended set of controls and canton fixed effects, as described in Table 3 .",
    "where T i is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a household received BDH transfers.",
    "If the reliability ratio of expenditures were similar in Ecuador, this would imply proportional attenuation bias of 0.18 to 0.30. standard error of 0.19); children in conditioned households are also more likely to be enrolled at baseline (the difference in the probability of enrollment is 0.075, with a standard error of 0.019), and are younger (the difference is -0.43 years, with a standard error of 0.11).",
    "Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation of a given variable for lottery losers, the difference between lottery winners and losers, and the standard error of this difference.",
    "Note that the sample size for (1), the model that only uses the follow-up survey, is larger than the sum of the sample sizes for the two models that use both the baseline and follow-up surveys.",
    "This is about 6 percentage points lower than the comparable number at the time of the baseline survey, 0.770, reported in Table 2 .",
    "17 Finally, we regressed baseline outcomes (enrollment or child work) on the extended set of controls, canton fixed effects, and a dummy variable for conditioned households:",
    "7 Differences and standard errors are computed by regressing the variable in question-for example, log per capita expenditures at baseline-on a dummy variable for lottery winners.",
    "In a regression of a dummy variable for enrollment at baseline on the log of total household expenditure in the BDH evaluation sample, without controls, the coefficient on expenditure is 0.108, with a standard error of 0.016;",
    "When variables are child-specific, as is the case with enrollment, child age and gender, the unit of observation is the child, and standard errors are corrected for correlations across children within households.",
    "8 Further evidence of the exogeneity of study group assignment is provided by a regression of a dummy variable for lottery winners on all of the variables in the table.",
    "Table 6 reports the effects of winning the BDH lottery, for conditioned and unconditioned households, and separately for the full and trimmed samples.",
    "6 Attrition is most likely to introduce biases in estimation when there are large differences between attrited and other households (Fitzgerald, Gottschalk and Moffitt 1998) , or when attrition is correlated with treatment status (Angrist 1997; Angrist et al.",
    "The results in Table 7 show that this is indeed the case: None of the estimated BDH lottery effects are anywhere near conventional levels of significance, and the coefficients for conditioned and unconditioned households are essentially indistinguishable from each other.",
    "When a set of unrestricted child age dummies is included in the regression, the coefficient on the dummy variable for attrited children becomes insignificant: The coefficient is -0.033, with a robust standard error of 0.034.",
    "The mean coefficient on X i from one hundred repetitions of this simulation is 0.496, implying proportional attenuation of 0.504 in the estimated cross-sectional relationship between enrollment and log household income."
