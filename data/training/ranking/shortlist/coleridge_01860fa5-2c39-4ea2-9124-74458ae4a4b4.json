    "(2012) have used the Data by Papers feature in NDAR to associate the specific data that was used in the publication with the article.",
    "The data are available by searching in NDAR and by using the LinkOut feature in PubMed.",
    "Before requesting access, a researcher can see the data dictionaries that were used to deposit the data, the number of observations, and the number of unique subjects.",
    "Researchers can apply to NDAR to access this data and they can use this data set for comparison with similar data from subjects with ASD.",
    "Thus, data obtained about a particular subject aggregates across laboratories, research projects, and data repositories, allowing for a consistent mechanism for the identification of a research subject across the entire research community over time.",
    "The request is evaluated by a data access committee composed of NIH program staff.",
    "2011; Kasari and Lawton 2010; McPheeters et al.",
    "This information is being provided under the Data from Labs tab on the NDAR website as well as in the Autism Publications tab.",
    "The data available in NDAR associated with a paper listed in PubMed is made available using their LinkOut feature.",
    "This tab allows users to see the exact data that are associated with a publication or any other study.",
    "Data from over 25,000 research participants are available to qualified investigators through the NDAR portal.",
    "This article describes the basic structure of NDAR, the strategies that the database has used to try to overcome the issues of data heterogeneity, solutions to some of the problems in making data from human subjects widely available to the research community, and the results of these efforts so far.",
    "In step 1, a user asks for data from multiple sites.",
    "When data is received from a laboratory it is assembled in a collection listed in the Data from Labs section of the website.",
    "A third way to search through the database is to use the Data from Papers tab.",
    "The web site also provides easy data browsing by the investigator who submitted the data or by the paper that was published using the data.",
    "Allowing easy download of the data associated with a publication facilitates the replication and extension of results.",
    "NDAR has become the data repository that houses the data measured in the NIH Study of Normal Brain Development (Evans and the Brain Development Cooperative Group 2006).",
    "The validated, aggregated, and curated data allow researchers to explore hypotheses that would not be possible to formulate using data from a single laboratory.",
    "Still, the need to support heterogeneous studies, retrospective data, and other established repositories make it difficult to avoid duplication without either committing extensive resources to data migration or to require the community to adopt an established standard.",
    "Researchers with smaller amounts of data are Fig.",
    "Once provided, NDAR staff curate new data structures ensuring that new instruments, measures, and scientific experiments are properly defined and that common elements like gender, age, height and weight are reused.",
    "The search feature allows a researcher who does not have access to NDAR (or to some of the federated repositories) to see if there is enough data to warrant applying for access.",
    "2011; Scherer and Dawson 2011) .",
    "Sharing data, associated tools, and methodologies, rather than just summaries or interpretations, can accelerate research progress by allowing re-analysis of data, as well as re-aggregation, integration, and rigorous comparison with other data, tools, and methods.",
    "2011; Penagarikano et al.",
    "When the project started in 2007 a great deal of ASD-related data had already been aggregated in privately funded data and biorepositories such as the Autism Genetics Research Exchange (AGRE), the Autism Tissue Program (ATP), the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (Fischbach and Lord 2010) , and the Interactive Autism Network (IAN).",
    "The ATP has federated many of these data sources with NDAR, providing access to a variety of data sets including MRIs of the donor brain tissue.",
    "The large number of papers that have resulted from the ADNI dataset has encouraged us to try to find ways to aggregate imaging data in NDAR even though specifying data collection protocols to achieve consistency is not yet appropriate for ASD.",
    "The NDAR data validation tool, which is available as a community resource, enables a researcher to confirm that his or her data conforms to the existing definitions.",
    "For new data structures or experiments, researchers can easily develop a new data definition, often using existing data structures as templates.",
    "First, it allows for the easy definition of an experiment using relational database technology to ensure the reference data are defined.",
    "DICOM, MINC 1.0 and 2.0, Analyze, NIfTI-1, AFNI and SPM).",
    "The use of the NDAR GUID makes available data collected from a single participant across multiple studies by different investigators, saving effort and resources for both investigators and research subjects without redundant visits, blood draws, questionnaire administration, or imaging.",
    "NDAR also provides information drawn from NLM's PubMed for papers and the NIH Reporter for grant awards.",
    "The current challenge for both the ASD community and the bioinformatics community is to see if the curated heterogeneous data that were not originally measured with the thought of deposition into a database will allow new hypotheses to be generated.",
    "genetic data) generated by researchers who accessed the tissue.",
    "With a relatively large number of images made available in one site, NDAR is a good source of raw data to compare results from different processing pipelines and to see which of those derived results correlate with data from the clinical and environmental assessments or with the demographic information about research subjects.",
    "Although the amount of data in NDAR is just now reaching the point where it will be widely useful to the research community, the database has already been used to as a private collaboration space to allow a research team interested in Fragile X to assemble and analyze their data (Sansone et al.",
    "When the number of observations is different from the number of unique subjects, data were acquired on a subject more than one time.",
    "Common standards such as the GUID and a variety of data definitions and data validation tools enable NDAR to organize heterogeneous research data across many laboratories and repositories.",
    "Researchers interested in only this sort of data can apply to access the data from either NDAR or the other data repository.",
    "When certain data collection instruments have become widely used in the field, we will explore the creation of a more formal lexicon.",
    "Specific instruction on the use of the data dictionary is available in the tutorials section of the NDAR website.",
    "Furthermore as investigators begin new studies, it should be easier for them to use the GUIDS and existing data standards.",
    "Much of the imaging data in NDAR comes from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (Brain Development Cooperative Group 2006), but there are images from 270 subjects with ASD, as well.",
    "The data collected in these ASD studies are highly heterogeneous, including those from clinical assessments, a wide variety of genetic and genomic measures, numerous different imaging modalities, and a range of quantitative behavioral assessments, such as eye movement tracking.",
    "However, the ability to define phenotypes (see below) helps researchers search across data elements that are related to each other.",
    "NDAR is linking to dbGaP, dbVar, and the Sequence Read Archive, the federal data repositories containing genetic/genomic data.",
    "However, there are also significant data on a few environmental exposure types."
