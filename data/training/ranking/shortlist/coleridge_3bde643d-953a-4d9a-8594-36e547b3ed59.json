  "shortlist": [
    "The data from these subjects will be used to quantify within-and between-scanner heterogeneity, to identify the determinants of this variance, to quantify the effects on the data, and to develop post-hoc calibration methods to attenuate these effects.",
    "Multicenter studies provide a means of acquiring data from relatively large samples of subjects, representing different geographical areas.",
    "In addition to the new data being acquired in WP5, existing data from previous studies have been collated from more than 3000 subjects, using 16 datasets from 9 of the consortium partners.",
    "60, 65 The study has therefore included a travelling subject study, an approach that has been previously adopted in other multicenter studies.",
    "45, 52 A further limitation of multivariate studies in the field to date is that in most cases, the findings have not been validated in an independent dataset.",
    "These legacy data are being used to facilitate the development of novel machine learning algorithms that will be applied to the new datasets from WP5.",
    "The application of multivariate data-driven approaches, such as machine learning 30, 31 allows inferences to be made at the individual level, and therefore carry greater translational potential for application in clinical practice.",
    "These include structural MRI, DTI, and fMRI data, as well as nonimaging data (basic sociodemographic and clinical data), from patients with psychosis, patients with genetic vulnerability for psychosis (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), CHR-P individuals and healthy controls.",
    "4, 10, 44, [48] [49] [50] [51] This is important as the reliability of machine learning is directly affected by sample size, and overall accuracies are seen to decrease with sample size.",
    "Data are being collected at first presentation and again at a number of follow-up timepoints, with the same instruments and methodological procedures being used at each site.",
    "Supplementary material 1 provides a detailed overview of the sociodemographic information, clinical, and cognitive measures collected at the different follow-up timepoints.",
    "46 Studies have employed structural 44 and functional MRI data 47 but also nonimaging data 41 to make predictions on broadly 3 areas: diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment.",
    "23, 24 This also suggests that overfitting may be taking place; which is when a machine learning model is fitted to noise in the data rather than to an underlying pattern of interest.",
    "42, 59 In this context, multivariate analysis approaches such as machine learning, which can take into account simultaneously different clinically meaningful measures, have the potential of generating valid, clinically relevant, and usable prediction models.",
    "Similarly, unsupervised machine learning approaches 31, 78 will be used to identify subgroups of patients and investigate their clinical outcomes.",
    "Using relatively large datasets of FEP patients, Vieira et al 45 reported lower classification accuracies than previous studies (between 50% and 70%), but also poor generalizability of models to other sites.",
    "This consortium aims to recruit a large sample of CHR-P and FEP participants and to collect a number of multimodal imaging measures (ie, structural, resting state functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging data), which will be integrated with psychopathological, sociodemographic, genetic, metabolomic, proteomic, immunological and cognitive data with the aim of improving outcome prediction.",
    "Table 2 lists some potential benefits and challenges that can arise when performing multicenter studies involving imaging acquisition.",
    "76 The combination of imaging and nonimaging data may result in a more accurate model with higher predictive power compared with that of previous prediction tools, 42, 77 in particular, if different risk estimation tools are used in the context of a sequential and stepped assessment to enrich the risk prediction.",
    "To date, most predictive algorithms in psychosis have used data from a single modality, such as MRI data 44, 75 or clinical data.",
    "43, 53 Finally, each lab tends to use its own pre-processing techniques and machine learning analytical approaches, adding further complexity/heterogeneity when comparing results from different studies.",
    "On the other hand, a negative correlation between sample size and accuracy might also be a sign of publication bias rather than overfitting.",
    "77 With both legacy and newly collected data, supervised machine learning approaches 31 will be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (eg, psychosis onset, social and role functioning, changes in symptom scores, and treatment response) from both neuroimaging and nonneuroimaging data.",
    "Figure 1 and table 1 show the design of the PSYSCAN study.",
    "The acquisition protocol includes published pulse-sequence design (ie, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI-2 T1 and ADNI-3 FLAIR 64 ) and study-specific Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI sequences (supplementary materials 2).",
    "To date, the majority of neuroimaging studies investigating abnormalities in the CHR-P and FEP populations have employed univariate analytical methods that allow statistical inferences at the group, rather than the individual level.",
    "Therefore, alongside clinical and cognitive data, blood samples (including whole blood, serum, and plasma) are collected for analyses of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and immune markers at baseline, 6 and 12 months in the CHR-P and HC cohorts and at baseline and 12 months in the FEP cohort.",
    "In the PSYSCAN study, although all sites are using scanners with the same field strength and harmonized acquisition parameters (supplementary materials 2), additional variability can still arise through the use of scanners that differ in model, manufacturer or specific features.",
    "These algorithms will initially be validated by dividing the samples into discovery and validation subsamples, and more definitively by testing the algorithms on analogous, independent datasets from other research consortia, through the",
    "These subgroups could potentially then be used to further inform supervised learning, for instance, by stratifying the subjects before making predictions.",
    "[60] [61] [62] [63] To minimize such effects, all sites in the PSYSCAN consortium used 3T scanners, adopted a common image acquisition protocol and underwent a site qualification procedure to ensure that the standard acquisition protocol could be implemented locally (supplementary materials 2).",
    "A further methodological challenge for multicenter studies is to ensure reliability of nonimaging data collection across multiple sites.",
    "Work-Package 5 (WP5) is responsible for collecting data from (1) CHR-P individuals, (2) FEP patients, and (3) healthy controls, in a naturalistic prospective design.",
    "20, 21 Although some neuroimaging studies have reported findings that may differentiate patients with distinct clinical outcomes, 22 these have yet to be externally validated and translated into tools that can be used in clinical practice.",
    "45 While the initial machine learning studies suggest that this approach holds some promise, they have involved relatively small groups of subjects.",
    "Standardized and harmonized psychopathological, demographic, cognitive, and genetic measures are collected at baseline and during follow-up assessments.",
    "In this context, overfit models might give very high accuracies on the training data but will not generalize to new data.",
    "This might in part be explained by (1) differences in the sociodemographic (eg, age, ethnicity, migration, socioeconomic status) and clinical features of the samples studied, which often reflect inter-site differences in catchment area populations, type of early detection and intervention services involved, and potential sampling biases (particularly in CHR-P individuals 25 ); (2) the use of relatively small samples, which might result in type I and type II errors 26 and therefore limited generalizability of the findings; (3) heterogeneous image preprocessing protocols; and lastly (4) the use of different inclusion criteria in different studies, leading to substantial heterogeneity in symptom severity and comorbidities.",
    "Key steps for future progress in the field include the validation of prognostic and predictive algorithms in independent datasets from other projects (ie, external validation).",
    "One of the core aims of the project is to integrate neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and peripheral biomarker data to facilitate the prediction of psychosis onset, clinical and functional outcomes.",
    "Overall, PSYSCAN and similar large cohort studies are purposely designed to significantly contribute to the bench-to-bed approach and aim to develop clinically usable tools to predict psychotic illness onset and course, differential diagnosis, treatment response, and functional outcome, with practical implications for individualized treatment.",
    "32, 33 In addition, multivariate approaches consider multiple voxels simultaneously and between-voxel correlations, rather than each voxel independently, and might therefore be better suited to detecting abnormalities at a network level, rather than focally.",
    "23 This suggests that results from previous studies, including studies on patients with psychosis, may not be generalizable, and so must be interpreted with caution.",
    "For these measures to be embedded in day-to-day clinical practice they ideally should be collectable using methods that (1) are widely available, (2) do not require an excessive amount of patient or clinician time, and that (3) have a reasonable cost.",
    "This applies to some of the potentially useful measures in psychosis, such as MRI scanning or a blood sample for whole genome sequencing, whereas others may require technology that is relatively inaccessible (eg, positron emission tomography-PET-scanning) or analyses that are currently relatively expensive (eg, proteomics).",
    "This is in part explained by the use of univariate analytical techniques, small samples and lack of statistical power, lack of external validation of potential biomarkers, and lack of integration of nonimaging measures (eg, genetic, clinical, cognitive data).",
    "In this article, we provide an overview of the PSYSCAN protocol and we discuss benefits and methodological challenges of large multicenter studies that employ neuroimaging measures.",
    "However, the involvement of several sites also introduces methodological challenges, particularly in controlling for the effects of site differences when acquiring imaging data.",
    "Current markers in the literature have highlighted CFI and C6 proteins, 72 reduced levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids 73 and increased levels of IL-6 74 , however, this is a rapidly developing field so we will plan to undertake both an exploratory and hypothesis-led approach based on the most recent findings at the time of analysis.",
    "[56] [57] [58] Therefore, integrating neuroimaging, biological, clinical, and cognitive data may facilitate the multimodal prediction of psychosis onset and clinical outcomes."
