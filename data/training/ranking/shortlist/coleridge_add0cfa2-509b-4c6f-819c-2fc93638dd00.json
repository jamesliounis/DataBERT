    "in Barro and Lee 2013) as will be shown in the paper.",
    "The WIC dataset has been already used in a number of scientific and action papers.",
    "The new base-year dataset of most recent information on population by level of educational attainment by age and sex was developed and documented in Bauer et al.",
    "The WIC 2015 dataset was validated and compared against some empirical datasets namely IPUMS, NSOs, and UIS (see Figure 8 ).",
    "We have presented a new dataset on population by age, sex, and level of educational attainment for the period 1970 to 2060 (and extended to 2100) for 171 countries.",
    "The dataset is constructed around collected and harmonized empirical census and survey data sets for the projection base year.",
    "For the latter, after mentioning the most important efforts, we concentrate the comparison on the most widely used and referenced ones, the Barro and Lee dataset (2013) and de la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2012) .",
    "The paper is organized as follows.",
    "We focused on data from censuses available from IPUMS (Ruggles et al.",
    "The resulting dataset represents the state of the world education according to ISCED 1997.",
    "However, the dataset is one of the most comprehensive collections of information on global human capital in terms of coverage, sample size, level of detail and accuracy with respect to data harmonization.",
    "This dataset was built around an initial educational distribution of the population by age and sex, with high quality criteria.",
    "As was shown in section 3, while other datasets could in principle allow for this type of analysis, none are as complete or include the level of details existing in WIC 2015, and moreover they do not offer the same degree of consistency between countries and across time.",
    "Similar issues were found in De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech dataset (2012), where there are some problems with the processing and harmonization of the available educational data as basis for filling the data gaps.",
    "This was implemented by applying a dynamic panel data model, autoregressive of order 1 with fixed effects, which was estimated with 2-step generalized method of moments (GMM) over the period 1980-2005.",
    "This approach, which does not depend so much on historical data points -except for the validation --was later adopted and adapted by Barro and Lee (2013) , Cohen and Leker (2014) and De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2012) .",
    "The detailed results of the projections are available in the Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer 16 website and analyzed in details in Lutz et al.",
    "The only competitor would be the datasets recently produced by Barro and Lee (2015) although it is more limited in terms of scope (146 countries), time (until 2040), age groups (15-64) and scenarios (only one trend scenario).",
    "Based on their collected data points, Barro and Lee (2013) interpolate/extrapolate the population by age and education between/from empirical data points forand backward.",
    "Several research teams came up with the idea to reconstruct and harmonize time series on levels of education attainment -which stems from enrolment data that are more readily available than education stocks.",
    "De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2000; also adapt the methods from Cohen and Soto (2007) and Barro and Lee (2010) to interpolate/extrapolate backward and forward by adding miscellaneous information and their professional judgment to create smooth time series of educational attainment\nOne of the main difference between all datasets lies in the original data that are used to either backproject, interpolate, or extrapolate as all estimation exercises including the WIC 2015 data set have to rely on an already existing data collection on education by age and sex.",
    "The first approach which was primarily developed by Barro and Lee (1993 , and additional versions in 2001 and further used by other researchers such as Cohen and Soto (2007) , and De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech (2000) , to cite the most important ones, was to use the existing data points to inter-/extra-polate the missing data points using several methods such as the perpetual inventory method.",
    "Countryspecific differentials in fertility by level of education for the base year were obtained from the literature and from census and survey data (see also K.C.",
    "In the WIC 2015 dataset, findings from an earlier collection and harmonization effort (Bauer et al.",
    "The IPUMS dataset (Ruggles et al.",
    "The comparison between WIC 2015 and available historical data points is performed on the proportional share of the 6 education categories in the population aged 25 years and over (see Appendix Table A .1 for a complete list of available historical data).",
    "The latest version (Barro and Lee 2013 ) is using more census data from national statistics offices, as it has turned out to be the most reliable data source.",
    "To overcome the gaps in existing time series we have collected, harmonized, reconstructed and validated large amount of data coming from multiple data sources.",
    "The third empirical dataset that was used for the comparison was that of the UIS which offers 257 data points on educational attainment for 127 countries.",
    "Barro and Lee (2013) still is most comprehensive as it provides many education indicators by age and sex and over a long time period from 1950 to 2010 whereas the WIC 2015 dataset only goes back to 1970.",
    "-models, appropriate and good quality data on present as well as on the past are crucial (Cohen and Soto 2007) .",
    "In the WIC 2015, we have tried to circumvent the data quality and consistency issue by applying some procedures: (1) An extensive data collection, (2) a careful selection of the best data sources, (3) the harmonization of the data, and (4) a high level of detail considering age, sex, and education categories, as explained in section 2.2 and more extensively in Bauer et al.",
    "The outcome of this exercise is to this date the most comprehensive harmonized dataset on educational attainment.",
    "We selected three of them that are based on the existing literature.",
    "(2015) The results show not surprisingly the same sub-regions at the top as aforementioned, meaning with the highest level of MYS and the lowest level of intergenerational gap.",
    "Detailed information about the data harmonization methodology can be found in Bauer et al.",
    "In this paper, we present how the reconstructed data can be used to show descriptively different phenomena, related to the three most common gaps in education that are of geographical, gender and generational order.",
    "More analysis could be done -and it is our hope that more researchers will use the WIC 2015 dataset and its updates for their workbased on the back-projections and some has already been realized for instance to look at the relative impact of education and demography in what is called the demographic dividend .",
    "2015) , NSOs which show better fitting accuracies to the WIC 2015 back-projection dataset, but also from UIS which are exhaustive in terms of countries.",
    "The comparison between the WIC 2015 datasets and others point at the general difficulty of reconstructing time series based on partial and inconsistent data.",
    "We also shortly highlight the differences existing between the WIC 2015 dataset and the earlier version published in Lutz et al.",
    "In the third section, we compare the results of the back-projections with the other existing datasets as mentioned above.",
    "2 Since the back-projections rely mostly on data for the base-year, it is highly important to arrive at a high quality base data, which is explained in the next section.",
    "For the first type, we focus on three main data sources, IPUMS, NSO, and UIS.",
    "It served as the basis for the projections (Lutz et al.",
    "We will compare the WIC 2015 reconstruction to two types of dataset on educational attainment: empirical and reconstructed.",
    "Another issue could occur from the reliability of the source data that would require the reviewing of data documentation and related literature to identify flaws in the census quality, or deviations due to education specific migration movements.",
    "For the Barro and Lee (2013) (2007) is not one to one comparable to the post-secondary education category in the WIC 2015 dataset which includes the ISCED 4 category (post-secondary non-tertiary) which was under secondary in the previous dataset.",
    "However the matching is better in the 1990 census year with 37 datasets out of which 24 are categorized as A or B, less so as we move back in time.",
    "(2007) provide a summary of the backprojection methodology and of how migration and mortality differentials were dealt in the previous round of back-projection."
