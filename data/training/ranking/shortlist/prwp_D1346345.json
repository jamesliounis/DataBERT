    "The paper is organized as follows.",
    "Table 18 tabulates data relevant to these two questions.",
    "As can be seen from data in Table 21 , the 'intra-product' exports accounted on average in 1998 for 35 percent for the first tier group plus Slovakia and only 8 percent for the second group.",
    "\"(Michalopoulos, 1999, p. 22).",
    "The data examined so far indicate that at least some CEEC seem to actively participate in them for two reasons.",
    "The approach outlined above implies the following steps of analysis.",
    "A quick glance at the correlation matrix leads to the observation that the composition of imports appears to be more similar than the composition of exports.",
    "to 79 percent in 1998 and the share in imports from 76 percent to 82 percent over the same period (Table 6 ).",
    "Three observations can be derived from Table 5 , which provides information on the part content in imports in major two-digit SITC product groups.",
    "Source: Computations based on country data as reported to the UN COMTRADE database.",
    "Detailed analysis of the values of RCA indices over time would provide an answer as to the cause.",
    "There are several indications of it.",
    "As can be seen from Table 12 , these products accounted for significant portions of exports and imports of only a few CEEC in 1997.",
    "1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 Larger number of CEEC has the values of 'import' RCA for components and parts exceeding unity that usually indicates participation in transborder production chains as well as the existence of assembly operations in a country.",
    "These data suggest that 'information revolution' sectors-both as inputs embodying high technology and production activity-are no longer marginal in CEEC-10 economies.",
    "Correlations between export structures reveal some interesting developments.",
    "In order to obtain some insights into dynamics, the last two lines of Table 9 Change in Slovakia's export basket may reflect redirection from the Czech markets rather than deep industrial restructuring.",
    "Analyses pointing to a rapidly increasing level of processing in goods traded by CEEC would suggest that parts and components has been the engine of growth of their trade-see among others Aturupane, Djankov and Hoekman (1998) , Baldone, Lasagni and Sdogati (1997, Dobrinsky (1995) and Kaminski, Wang and Winters (1996) .",
    "First, we use a narrow definition of parts to assess major developments in comparative perspective and identify variation, if any, in CEEC performance.",
    "It follows from our detailed analysis that values of 'import'",
    "Table 9 reports correlation coefficients of EU-oriented exports (below the diagonal in italics) and",
    "Table 4 reports values of CEEC-10 imports and exports of parts sorted in descending order according to the value of imports in 1998.",
    "Other authors suggest the use of the 'end-use' categories of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, which allow identification of products by their use by buyers rather than in terms of their positions in production process (Feenstra 1998 , Irwin, 1996 .",
    "On the basis of our analysis of trade in parts, we identify three major networksautomotive network, office equipment and automatic data processing machines jointly analyzed with telecommunication equipment (hereafter 'information revolution' network) and furniture network.",
    "The index suffers from two problems: aggregation and aggregate trade imbalances-see Greenway and Milner (1987) .",
    "and Slovenia -20 percent (Table 14) .",
    "Appendix Table 4 reports both RCA indices for 60 part categories in CEEC trade with the EU in 1997.",
    "The result of these developments is-to borrow an apt phrase from Feenstra (1998) -integration of trade and disintegration of production in the global economy.",
    "Has it indeed been the case?",
    "How does the performance of CEEC as a region and individual countries compare with that of our group of comparators?",
    "We shall use this index to assess the existence of links within narrowly defined production networks (see Section 5).",
    "Thus, Estonia's and Hungary's entry into global networks of multinationals producing 'office machinery equipment' have determined developments in CEEC trade with the EU over 1993-98 (Table 16) .20 There are, however, some indications of the potential for future growth in Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia.",
    "Although except for Hungary, these shares are considerably lower than those for 9Calculated from data presented in Appendix Table 2. imports of Malaysia and Mexico, it seems that these three Central Europeans are more involved in production sharing than others.",
    "........................................................ 15 3.5 .",
    "6, July and August 1998.)",
    "Yet, it seems that the 'network' analysis combined with a broader discussion of development in trade in parts provides a pretty good yardstick to gauge the significance of trade related to this finer division of labor.",
    "First, old connections due to previous existence within the same state still seem to matter.",
    "Since the purpose of this analysis is to identify a country's 'revealed comparative advantage' in production sharing, we modify this approach in three ways.",
    "On the import side, the geographical patterns of CEEC are remarkably similar to each other although the second tier CEECs tend to concentrate less on the EU than the first wave candidates (Table 7) .",
    "The largest \"part content\"",
    "While one may suspect that a fast increase in trade of this network has been induced by production sharing, it is impossible to draw a firm conclusion without a more detailed analysis of specialization patterns as revealed in values of \"export\" and \"import\" RCA indices.",
    "One way of capturing their importance is by first assessing the extent of these flows within each important part category and then focusing on selected networks of production and distribution.",
    "Do CEEC have any common features as shown in values of RCA indices for individual parts?",
    "Furthermore, data for Malaysia, Mexico as well as for some CEEC suggest that at some point exports tend to grow faster than imports.",
    "Taking into account the significance of trade in parts and components, the share of trade with a 'double' comparative advantage as well as the significance of networks in their trade, one may distinguish between two groups.",
    "At a more desaggregated level, note that both Slovakia and Slovenia have \"import\" comparative advantage in the same categories of components and parts (marked in bold italic in Table 15 ).",
    "Taking first the extent to which export earnings (aggregate value of exports of final products, components and parts) of a network pay for imports of parts and components, only four CEEC were in red in 1998.",
    "Central European countries (CEEC'), which are the focus of this analysis, are either WTO members or are in the final stages of the accession process.",
    "For a detailed analysis of the role and impact of outward processing in 'East-West' trade, seeGraziani (1996 and."
