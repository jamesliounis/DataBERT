    "More detail can be found in .",
    "A recent submitted paper summarizes the methods including details of historical data, validations, storm climatology development, and statistical analysis [Orton et al., submitted].",
    "Further evidence was provided at the 2016 State of the Bay Symposium, where an observational study and a modeling study were both referenced to support the estimate that the sediment inputs are about 5 times too low [Chant, 2016].",
    "The present-day topographic and bathymetric information was from a recent FEMA study [FEMA, 2014].",
    "An updated model grid we have produced under National Parks Service funding subsequent to the modeling done for this project utilizes the most up-to-date bathymetric data for the inlet, collected by Stony Brook's Roger Flood and others around ~2010 and only recently made public.",
    "We extracted the recent (\"present-day\") land cover data for the Jamaica Bay watershed at 30 m resolution from the National Land Cover Dataset (2011) (NLCD) as described in Homer et al.",
    "These maps have been frequently used for historical ecology studies [e.g., Bromberg and Bertness, 2005;Grossinger et al., 2005].",
    "Our initial work prior to this project (e.g.",
    "2.5.1 User Defined Facilities UDF data at the building level were obtained from FEMA's CommunityViz project for New York City.",
    "To get an estimate of the portion of total NYC damages in Jamaica Bay caused by Hurricane Sandy, five spatially disaggregated damage data sets [FEMA, 2013;Sandy Funding Tracker, 2016a;US-HUD, 2013;US-SBA, 2012] were referenced.",
    "These elevation data were used to generate a composite elevation model depicting the study area in 1609.",
    "Users of this free online resource are able to download the results of a benefit-cost analysis, the underlying GIS layers corresponding to each scenario, and this technical report.",
    "Of particular interest for our study were a pair of H-sheets from 1877 and 1878 of Jamaica Bay: Maynard [1877] and Moore [1878].",
    "These data are a combination of bathymetric data from NOAA, which in itself is a mixture of data from different decades, and topographic data.",
    "Figure 3), accompanied with an intensive reading of the historical literature [notably, Bellot, 1917;Black, 1981;Munsell, 1882;Ostrander, 1894;Stiles, 1870;Taney, 1961].",
    "The detailed report (the present document) presents an in depth look at the methods used to create the scenarios and assess the impacts contained within AdaptMap",
    "The presence of \"grass\" (likely eel grass) on the 1877 bed was mapped and is included in the Mannings-n data.",
    "The landcover indications on these maps were interpreted to match landcover classes described by the 2011 National Land Cover Dataset [Homer et al., 2015] for comparison to other scenarios in this study.",
    "GIS Flood data and benefit-cost analysis results are available for user download.",
    "Results from the aforementioned flood hazard study for NY Harbor are used as offshore boundary data for our Jamaica Bay model grid.",
    "This computation was performed for the 2016 central estimate and upper-bound and lower-bound estimates of the EAB, then also for the same for 2055.",
    "In a separate report, we summarized the scenarios, the flood reduction results, display a few representative scenarios and interpret the physical reasons for changes in flood elevations [Orton and Wu, 2015].",
    "Computer modeling was made possible, in part, by a grant of computer time from the City University of New York High Performance Computing Center under NSF Grants CNS-0855217, CNS-0958379 and ACI-1126113.",
    "A methodology outlined in the Irene Tropical Cyclone Report [Avila and Cangialosi, 2011] and data on insured loss estimates from Insurance News Net [Jeffries, 2011] were used to derive a set of three damage estimates.",
    "Below in Figure 16, typical monthly high tide is mapped, based on modeling but also seen in sea level data at Inwood, Rockaway Inlet, and in prior published work [Swanson and Wilson, 2008].",
    "Finally, the central estimate, as well as the low and high end uncertainty estimates, was multiplied by a widely cited damage cost estimate from Hurricane Sandy for NYC as a whole, $19 billion [Gormley, 2012], to provide a final range of damages.",
    "These were used to create 1609, 1877 and present-day model grids for sECOM (see Section 2.1), including land elevation and Mannings-n roughness (Figure 8).",
    "For the c. 1870s digital elevation model, we used a combination of several high-resolution Hsheet and T-sheet manuscript maps to construct a high resolution DEM.",
    "For the c. 1609 digital elevation model, we used a combination of U.S. Coast Survey charts, Revolutionary War-era maps, and early-mid 19 th century municipal planning maps to create an elevation profile for the Jamaica Bay watershed.",
    "These estimates were then combined with a fourth from NOAA [NOAA-NCDC, 2011] to produce a final damage estimate and uncertainty range for the whole of the USA.",
    "We digitized the shorelines, extent of marsh, substrate material type, and all topographic and bathymetric information from H-sheets and other nautical charts.",
    "At the request of our PAC (Project Advisory Committee), we evaluated the C-CAP data that is available, but found that urban classes of land cover that are dominant in our study area are not part of C-CAP.",
    "For purposes of this study, we created three inter-comparable descriptions of the Jamaica Bay watershed, representing the contemporary conditions; the landscape in the 1870s; and the pre-European landscape of c. 1609, when Henry Hudson arrived off the shores of what would someday become New York City [Sanderson, 2009].",
    "Because maps and charts were drawn at different times and sometimes with different definitions of shoreline (the \"topographic zero\", which might be defined relative to the observed mean sea level, mean lower low water or some other tidal datum), we adjusted elevations to a common vertical datum, in this case, NAVD88, adjusting for sea level rise.",
    "Present-day 2016 sea level is an estimate of +10 cm (4 inches) over that datum, based on an estimated 4 mm/y sea level rise rate inferred from the historical data at New York City (The Battery, a NOAA tide gauge).",
    "The historical 1609 landscape has an accompanying basemap based on the landcover classification for 1609 desribed earlier in the report.",
    "Some shortcomings of our study are noted here, but also additional research is outlined that will address these limitations.",
    "The raster type file is provided in the UTM18N projection and is compatible with most open source and commercial desktop GIS packages.",
    "Their results were used to identify RSL in the New York City region at the time the map or chart represents, and have been recently confirmed by analysis of a new core in Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx (Kemp, pers.",
    "Similarly the c. 1609 land cover is of necessity somewhat speculative, though here we can use known ecological relationships to help reinforce our interpretation of the pre-development ecology [Sanderson, 2009;Sanderson and Brown, 2007].",
    "This downloadable Microsoft Excel file summarizes the results of the benefit-cost analysis of flooding under each Adaptation Scenario.",
    "For the c. 1870s land cover map, we mainly used digitized features from the Bache [1882] coast chart.",
    "We obtained high resolution scans of manuscript and printed charts from 1844 -1907 with map scales ranging from 1:5,000 to 1:80,000.",
    "Mean sea level today for their study site was determined using NOAA Tides & Currents adjustment values for Barnegat Inlet [Station 8533615;NOAA, 2015].",
    "Approximately 20,000 individual sounding points were digitized to describe the interior of the bay, and were paired with contour lines and specific elevation points derived from Bien and Vermule [1891b], Bien and Vermeule [1891a], Dorr [1860], Gilbert [1855a], Gilbert [1856a], Gilbert [1856b], Gilbert and Sullivan [1857], Powell [1891], and Wilson [1897].",
    "The results are analyzed, flood probabilities computed, and resulting simplified estimates of flood heights placed into the tool for rapid retrieval.",
    "All sea levels rise projections are measured relative to the 1983-2001 base period, and are based on recent projections from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (Horton et al., 2015).",
    "The water quality topic is being evaluated with further study (see Section 4.5).",
    "In this study, we have leveraged existing computational flood model-based flood zone mapping and risk assessments to quantify the value of various nature-based flood mitigation approaches, develop new nature-based concepts, and map their flood protection services.",
    "In order to help users of AdaptMap understand the specific impacts of each part of each measure, the three scenarios are cumulative."
