    "Each table provides a summary of the sample, the sample size, the authors, and the study design in the first column, the age group of the sample in the second column, the timeframe of interviews in the third column, and the main findings in the fourth column.",
    "Our search identified 521 papers, 46 of which satisfied selection criteria.",
    "These tables aim to highlight the most meaningful conclusions from the studies collected.",
    "First, the studies included in this review were population-based and utilized a variety of diagnostic survey instruments that are, to varying degrees, imperfect substitutes for clinician-administered structured interviews.",
    "The sampling frame for this review included populationbased studies that assessed the heterogeneity of symptom syndromes or trajectories of common mood and anxiety disorders.",
    "In Table one and Table two (Additional files 1 and 2), we present all findings within two broad categories according to whether they assessed heterogeneity of symptom syndromes (n = 17) or heterogeneity of trajectories (n = 29), respectively.",
    "Second, we analyzed abstracts for all studies identified and excluded papers that did not satisfy selection criteria.",
    "Within each table, studies were further stratified based on the particular mood and anxiety disorder assessed (e.g., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder) and then sorted in ascending order based on the age group of the sample (i.e., adolescent, adult, elderly) and alphabetically based on the first author's last name.",
    "However, these techniques can be overly sensitive to the data and may complicate comparisons across studies.",
    "The objective of this study was to systematically review the epidemiologic evidence for potential patterns of heterogeneity of common mood and anxiety disorders over the lifecourse in the general population.",
    "It is hoped that this review will be useful in pointing the way to further research and potentially to more effective intervention strategies.",
    "These studies typically used latent class growth, semi-parametric group-based modeling, or other techniques to identify distinct trajectories according to the inferential goal of the analysis [77, 78] .",
    "Accordingly, most recent population-based research has used different survey instruments to define the presence of mood and anxiety disorders based on these criteria, either in the form of a categorical diagnosis or as symptom severity levels on a unidimensional scale.",
    "Studies that assessed heterogeneity of clinical presentations either specified criteria a priori or used statistical methods to identify subtypes.",
    "While having pre-defined criteria facilitates comparisons between studies, there is ongoing debate about the validity of recognized subtypes [73, 74] .",
    "We identified potential studies for inclusion by querying all possible search fields for combinations of the following terms: 'anxiety', 'mood', 'disorder', 'heterogeneity', ' symptom', 'subtype', 'symptom subtype', 'trajectory', 'trajectories', 'depression', 'posttraumatic stress', 'PTSD', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', and 'ADHD'.",
    "In a representative sample of adults from Zurich, Merikangas and colleagues (2003) used log-linear models to investigate the relation between anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety and depression.",
    "Of the 29 studies that assessed heterogeneity in the trajectories of mood and anxiety disorders (Additional file 2), 22 assessed depression, three assessed anxiety, two assessed general anxiety and depression, one assessed symptoms of hyperactivity, and one assessed PTSD.",
    "Studies applied different statistical techniques, most commonly latent growth curve or semi-parametric group-based modeling, to identify trajectories of mood and anxiety disorders on the basis of the observed data.",
    "Ten studies relied on different statistical methods, most frequently latent class analysis, to identify subtypes based on observed data.",
    "It is the goal of this paper to systematically review the epidemiologic evidence for potential patterns of heterogeneity in both the symptom syndromes and in the trajectories of common mood and anxiety disorders.",
    "For example, in a prospective study of 120 patients treated for current major depressive disorder, Ceroni and colleagues (1984) found that the majority of patients recovered within the first few months of treatment, but 39 percent were persistently depressed during the first year of followup [8] .",
    "In that study, Angst and colleagues (2002) found that atypical depression was characterized by greater longitudinal chronicity [38] .",
    "We obtained papers for this review using a four-step procedure.",
    "First, because our review was based on DSM-IV definitions of the mood and anxiety disorders, we performed a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature using the Index Medicus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases.",
    "For example, analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey showed that depressive atypicality, a subtype based on patterns of symptoms, was associated with interpersonal dependency, reduced self esteem and stressful life events [22, 24] .",
    "Fourth, we retrieved articles not identified by our literature review from the references of remaining papers and excluded those that did not satisfy selection criteria.",
    "For example, one study of young adults from Zurich showed that the course of diagnostically defined atypical depression was associated with an earlier age of onset and greater chronicity [38] .",
    "According to Thase (2007) , for example, the origins of the atypical depressive subtype can be traced back to the work of Sir Aubrey Lewis, who in the 1930s proposed dividing depression into endogenous or nonendogenous subtypes, a partition supported by the psychopharmacologic work of West and Dally in 1959 [5] .",
    "Of the 17 studies, 10 studies assessed depression, three studies assessed social phobia, and there was one study each on PTSD, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and panic attack.",
    "In their general population sample of adults from Baltimore, Chen and colleagues (2000) identified five latent classes with distinct patterns of depressive symptoms, including non-depressed, anhedonic, suicidal, psychomotor, and severely depressed subtypes [23] .",
    "Facilitated by methods such as latent class analysis, a growing body of epidemiologic research has attempted to disentangle phenotypic heterogeneity of common mood and anxiety disorders by identifying clusters of symptoms.",
    "For example, one study showed the atypical major depression subtype was associated with an increased prevalence of comorbid panic disorder and drug abuse/dependence [33] , whereas a national sample of US adults showed that more deviant personality and attitudes, increased psychiatric comorbidity, and parental alcohol/drug use were associated with membership in severe typical or atypical depressive classes relative to milder subtypes [22] .",
    "On the other hand, a study of communitydwelling adults aged 65 and older from areas of North Carolina showed that the positive relation between age and depressive symptoms was driven primarily by differences between cohorts, and that adjustment for indicators of the life course (i.e., marriage, socioeconomic status, employment status), physiological declines, and sex compositions largely explained these cohort effects [67] .",
    "The extant literature suggests that certain characteristics may predispose individuals to membership in more severe, versus less severe, longitudinal trajectories of depression.",
    "Second, in most studies that assessed the characteristics associated with distinct clinical presentations or trajectories, methods of variable selection were not theoretically predicated.",
    "Third, we analyzed the full-text version of all remaining studies and excluded those that did not satisfy selection criteria.",
    "Using a probability sample of 1,972 Black and White adults age 65 and older from five counties in North Carolina, a significant association was found between stress growth and growth of depressive symptoms, particularly among Blacks [65, 66] .",
    "First, because most studies were cross-sectional and started in adulthood, it was impossible to distinguish associations that may reflect a causal pathway from those that may be spurious.",
    "Further information on the validity of common diagnostic instruments can be found elsewhere [72] .",
    "While only a limited amount of work has been conducted in this field, we found growing epidemiologic evidence that, not only can mood and anxiety disorders be differentiated by symptom syndromes and trajectories, but that the factors associated with these disorders may vary between these subtypes.",
    "As with symptom syndromes, whether environmental factors are the cause of a particular trajectory, or whether individuals with a genetic predisposition to a particular trajectory are more susceptible to specific environmental factors, can only be answered by extended longitudinal studies and the assessment of interaction between genetic and environmental factors [70, 71] Finally, an alternative way of viewing these patterns was proposed by twin studies and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which both support a trait-state model of depression, where symptom levels can be accounted for by two factors: a level (average or \"trait\") effect that is highly heritable and reflects underlying vulnerability and a residual (\"state\") effect that is non-inheritable and reflects occasion specific circumstances [49, 71] .",
    "We restricted our review to population-based studies, as studies of the life course of these disorders need to include the large number of individuals with significant symptoms who do not seek appropriate clinical care and who would be excluded from studies drawn only from clinical populations [20] .",
    "Additional epidemiologic replication of these clinical subtypes is needed.",
    "We identified 17 studies that evaluated heterogeneity in symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders (Additional file 1).",
    "A number of studies showed that comorbid anxiety, mood, and substance disorders were more common among some depressive [22, 33] and panic [34] subtypes than others.",
    "Seven of 17 studies distinguished clinical subtypes of bipolar disorder, depression, and panic attack based on definitions specified a priori.",
    "This is important since this research also suggests that the factors associated with these disorders may vary by symptom and trajectory subtype.",
    "Using latent class analysis, Sullivan and colleagues (1998) identified six patterns of depressive symptoms in a probability sample of the US population, including a severe typical subtype with a high lifetime occurrence of depressive symptoms, a severe atypical subtype with many depressive symptoms and symptoms characterized by appetite increase and weight gain, and four other subtypes of varying symptom severity [22] .",
    "The recent World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Surveys, for example, interviewed 60,463 community-based adults living in 14 countries."
