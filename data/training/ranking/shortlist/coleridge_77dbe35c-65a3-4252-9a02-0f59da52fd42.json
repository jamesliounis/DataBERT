    "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).",
    "For example, when testing five ROIs, a P value of 0.010 is needed among one of the tested ROIs for the test to achieve significance, followed by 0.013, 0.017, 0.025, and 0.050.",
    "All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).",
    "Data for cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid PET scans on 227 of 280 participants were also downloaded for a supplementary analysis (Supplementary Data).",
    "This data set consisted of 264 volumetric regions derived from preprocessed T1 images using techniques previously described (27, 28) .",
    "Mean regional GM corresponding to each ROI was downloaded from a hierarchical parcellation MRI data set made available in ADNI from Davatzikos and colleagues (27, 28) .",
    "In this study, we examined the relationships among peripheral IR, baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion, and mean FDG metabolism within several ROIs targeted by AD and two control regions.",
    "Linear mixed modeling, followed by least significant differences post hoc tests, was used to test whether demographics, cognition, and other variables differed by baseline diagnosis of CN, MCI, or AD (Table 1) .",
    "All models included the following covariates: age at baseline, sex, education, hyperglycemia status, ApoE e4 genotype, and mean regional GM within the ROI examined.",
    "Similar analyses were done with QUICKI and yielded nearly identical results (data not shown).",
    "The following analyses were conducted in the cohort (n = 280).",
    "Table 1 indicates values for the MMSE, AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale, the clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes, and previously derived ADNI factor scores for executive function (24) and memory (25) .",
    "FDG-PET acquisition and preprocessing details have been described elsewhere (29) .",
    "Briefly, for an MCI participant who met criteria for probable AD on a given visit, the site physician provided diagnostic data to the ADNI Conversion Committee, which reached a consensus regarding conversion.",
    "Supplementary Text 1 describes a supplemental analysis among 227 participants, where MCI and AD groups were enriched for amyloid-positive status.",
    "To this end, we used Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to calculate the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), an index of peripheral IR.",
    "Supplementary Table 1 reports lower FDG metabolism in a stepwise manner from CN to MCI to AD for global cerebrum, lateral parietal, posteromedial parietal, and hippocampus ROIs.",
    "The dependent variable was the mean FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratio for a given ROI.",
    "We addressed type 1 error by using HolmBonferroni correction (34) for all analyses.",
    "Importantly, the HOMA-IR and FDG-PET association for MCI-P remained similar after removing one log HOMA-IR value (0.87) three SDs from the group mean (R 2 = 0.307, P = 0.008), or that value and another case that was two SDs from the group mean (R 2 = 0.148, P = 0.048).",
    "For significant interactions, we performed follow-up analyses for each baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion group (35) to assess whether a significant linear association existed between HOMA-IR and FDG metabolism in one or more groups.",
    "Among all participants, the main effects of HOMA-IR were nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but the HOMA-IR 3 baseline diagnosis interactions were significant (Table 2 ).",
    "ROIs were selected based on previous studies examining progressive hypometabolism across the temporal progression of AD (31, 32) or areas where glucose metabolism has been associated with IR (18) .",
    "As a limitation, our sample size for CN was small, and thus, the lack of associations for this group should be interpreted with caution.",
    "The image set was then averaged, reoriented to a standard 160 3 160 3 96 voxel spatial matrix of resliced 1.5 mm 3 voxels, intensity normalized, and smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half maximum kernel.",
    "vPFC Among all participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was not significant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 baseline diagnosis interaction ( Table 2 ).",
    "For each of the five ROIs and two control regions, separate mixed models were used to test effects of baseline diagnosis (CN, MCI, AD) or MCI conversion (MCI-S, MCI-P).",
    "Regional GM volumes were used to account for the potential effects of regional atrophy in FDG analyses, because expanding sulci in MCI and AD brains may lead to underestimation of FDG values (26) .",
    "Previous studies have also shown positive associations between measures related to IR and brain indices, such as volume, in MCI/early AD and aged monkeys.",
    "Our ADNI subsample was typical in showing progressive hypometabolism from CN to MCI to AD (31) (32) (33) .",
    "These ROIs included hippocampus, MTL, lateral parietal, posteromedial (precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex), and vPFC.",
    "This closed test procedure maintains a family-wise a = 0.05 by requiring unadjusted P values of 0.05 divided by x, x being the number of null hypotheses tested.",
    "***P # 0.001. participants, the HOMA-IR main effects and HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interactions were also nonsignificant.",
    "Participants were clinically diagnosed at the screening and each subsequent visit based on standardized criteria (19) .",
    "Diagnostic groups did not differ by age, sex, or education ( Table 1) .",
    "The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership.",
    "(23) also used baseline glucose and insulin data in ADNI to compute QUICKI and determine glycemic groups for use in cognitive and imaging analyses.",
    "However, significant interactions were found between the baseline diagnosis and HOMA-IR in all ROIs as well as interactions between MCI conversion and HOMA-IR for temporal and frontal areas.",
    "Among MCI participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interaction (Table 2) .",
    "(22) found that HOMA-IR is stable across at least 4 years in overweight, late middleaged humans; therefore, our index of HOMA-IR very likely reflects IR at the time of the scan.",
    "Regionally specific patterns of hypo-and hypermetabolism or hypo-and hyperactivation (with FDG-PET and functional MRI, respectively) have been seen in populations at risk for AD and have been implicated in the transition to clinical AD.",
    "Mean FDG metabolism was derived for AD-vulnerable regions of interest (ROIs), including lateral parietal and posteromedial cortices, medial temporal lobe (MTL), hippocampus, and ventral prefrontal cortices (vPFC), as well as postcentral gyrus and global cerebrum control regions.",
    "Among MCI participants, the main effect of HOMA-IR was nonsignificant (Supplementary Table 1 ), but there was a significant HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion interaction ( Table 2) .",
    "Covariates included age at baseline, sex, education, hyperglycemia status, ApoE e4 genotype, and mean MTL GM volume.",
    "As expected, cognitive scores were lower and the proportion of non-ApoE e4 versus ApoE e4 increased from CN to MCI to AD participants as well as from MCI-S to MCI-P in a step-wise manner (data not shown).",
    "These results suggest that this ADNI subcohort shows the typical progressive hypometabolism from CN, to MCI, to AD (31-33).",
    "Three findings were of particular interest: First, in MCI-P participants, higher HOMA-IR predicted hypermetabolism in the hippocampus and MTL.",
    "5 Written informed consent was obtained from all ADNI participants at their respective ADNI sites.",
    "Future longitudinal studies should examine the pathophysiologic significance of the shift from MTL hyper-to hypometabolism associated with IR.",
    "We examined the main effect of baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion, anticipating a stepwise decrease in FDG-PET from CN to MCI to AD, and from MCI-S to MCI-P (33)."
