    "is more closely related to this paper.",
    "The joint significance of these two variables has a p-value of 0.003, suggesting the existence of cross-section selection bias with the OLS specification.",
    "We examined how PC participation and provisions affected the productivity of SOEs using a panel data set consisting of 769 firms from 1980 to 1989 located in four provinces of China from A Survey of Chinese SOEs: 1980 SOEs: -1989 (See the data appendix for more details.)",
    "We first tested whether PCs are correlated with productivity improvements when managers are selected through bidding, since we hypothesize that bidding will provide government with more information (row (a)).",
    "9We follow Li (1995) , which uses the same data set.",
    "Table 2 reports the benchmark results of how PCs affected the productivity level and growth rate, both for the pooled and the participants samples.",
    "In later empirical application, we use both samples and check if it is true that the pooled sample overstates more the effects of PCs.",
    "For the empirical application, we deleted any observations missing the dependent variable or covering too short a period (less than 8 years).",
    "The fixed effects estimates for both the pooled and the participants samples suggest that bidding had a negative but statistically insignificant correlation with productivity (row 1 under (a)); when we treat capital and labor as endogenous in the GMM estimates, the association becomes positive, but it is still insignificant.",
    "Since, following our earlier discussion, the cross-section selection bias for the pooled sample could overestimate the PC effects, greater confidence should be placed on the finding from the sample of participants.",
    "Since the data set has detailed information about the plan and the market prices of the two primary materials while it does not tell about those of energy and other intermediate inputs, the computation of the price indexes for intermediate inputs is based on the assumption that the inflation rate for intermediate inputs were the same as that of materials.",
    "In column (2), the FE estimates for the pooled sample suggest that when we control for firm dummies, PC-participants no longer differ significantly from non-PCparticipants: the participants-specific growth rate is not significant.",
    "Rows under \"OLS, pooled\" relate to OLS(l) above, and \"FE, pooled\" FE(2) above:",
    "[ Table 4 inserted here ]",
    "(1989).4 SeeByrd (1991) andLin, Li, Cai (1997), for more details about the implementation of PCs in China.",
    "Following Arellano and Bond (1991) , which suggests that properly lagged variables can be used to deal with endogeneity problem in a panel data environment, we take a first difference on the production function to filter out the firmspecific fixed effects; then use the generalized method of moments to estimate the production function.",
    "Note also that the dummy D,_ 1 (which is one in the year before the PC adoption) is not significant, suggesting that the reverse causality problem for PC participation should not be taken too seriously.",
    "Column (1) reports the OLS results for the pooled sample, controlling for productivity levels and growth rates specific to the sample of PC participants.",
    "This supports with a much larger sample our earlier findings (Shirley and Xu 1997) , and suggests that PCs are ineffective in competitive firms as well as natural monopolies.",
    "The only statistically significant association for PCs and productivity growth are found for PC,+, in the pooled sample, which, as we noted, may overstate the PC effects.",
    "To calculate the effect of different PC provisions, we re-ran the FE and first difference GMM models for both the pooled and participants only samples, for each of the variables that we presumed would affect information, incentives and commitment.'",
    "Using the FE estimators for the participants sample of Table 4 , we calculated the combined effects, reported in Table 5 .",
    "The markup ratio is constructed based onLi (1997), which uses the same data set as this paper.",
    "Our hypothesis that PCs work better when they provide higher powered incentives is partly supported: higher firm-level wage elasticity is correlated with higher productivity, although the results are statistically significant only for the FE estimates (row (d)).",
    "Here the mean or the percentile of wage elasticity is based on the PC-participants sample.",
    "In effect, this dummy will capture the systematic pattern in the error term of the unobservable in the year before the adoption.",
    "See the appendix for details.",
    "Section III presents our hypotheses about the effects of PCs.",
    "A final piece of evidence on the importance of information is the correlation between the impact of PCs on productivity levels and competition, as proxied by the markup ratio (row (c)).",
    "\", **, and *** represents significance levels of 10, 5, and I percent.",
    "To examine this possibility, we estimated the same FE specification but replaced the PC terms with PC,+j, j=l, 2, 3, 4, which is one if a PC was observed to be in place j years ago (see table 3 ).",
    "*, **, and *** represents significance levels of 10, 5, and I percent.",
    "As before, we also controlled for PCparticipants-sample-specific growth rate and reverse causality ( D, 1 ).",
    "(b) R 2 's reported under FE models are R 2 within.",
    "The PC effects in the pooled sample suffer from two sources of bias: (a) a cross section selection bias, that is, when the selection of better firms to sign PCs results in higher productivity which is wrongly attributed to the effects of the PCs; and, (b) a time series selection bias, that is, when the change in the unobservable of the participants leads to gains which are wrongly attributed to the PCs.",
    "Based on the authors' calculation from A Survey of Chinese SOEs: 1980-89.",
    "On the other hand, and consistent with our expectations, all four specifications imply a large (around 10 percent) and (in three of the four) statistically significant, positive association between bidding and the productivity growth rates (second row under (a)).",
    "The positive and, for the GMM estimates, significant sign of the PC participants growth rate dummy (Row 3 of Table 4 ) suggests that PC-participants had higher productivity growth rates than non-participants throughout the period.",
    "The parameters of interest are (a 1 ,a 2 ) , the effects of the PC on productivity levels and growth, respectively.",
    "14 Column (3) reports that first difference GMM results.",
    "See Heckman and Hotz (1989) andHeckman and Robb (1985) for the methods to deal with endogenous policy interventions.",
    "(1994,Jefferson (1994),Johnson (1990),Lin (1992), and McMillan et al.",
    "*, ** and * represent significance levels of 10, 5 and I per cent respectively..",
    "In many cases, only the level or rate effect was found to be statistically significant; in these cases only the significant term was kept in the final specification, although we kept at least one type of effect (level or rate, depending on which was more statistically robust) for each PC feature.",
    "We use several methods to deal with this endogeneity problem.",
    "(a) Standard errors (OLS and 2SLS estimates has corrected for heteroskedasticity) in parentheses.",
    "4 In our data set, the share of state enterprises under PCs grew from 8 percent in 1986 to 42 percent in 1987; it then skyrocketed to 88 percent by 1989.",
    "The advantage of using the pooled sample is the increase in sample size; the disadvantage is the upward cross-section bias that results because good firms may select into PCs.",
    "In addition, ,u 1 is normalized to be 1, p,j for material, machine, and chemical industries are estimated to be 0.41, 0.35, and 0.48.",
    "In our empirical analysis, the reduction of information asymmetry is represented by bidding and targets which focused on profits."
