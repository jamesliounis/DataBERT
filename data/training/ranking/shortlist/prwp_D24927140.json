    "Data and Prima-Facie Evidence Our sample selection depended on panel data availability for Latin American firms.",
    "This is where the contribution of our paper lies.",
    "However, this literature has tended to rely on data on exporting firms or product-level trade flow data.",
    "For the sake of completeness, we report these results in the relevant results table discussed in the next section.",
    "These results appear in the (unconditional) descriptive data, in the estimate of conditional EPA treatment effects, and are robust to the use of three different types of propensity matching to control for the fact that export promotion services are not randomly allocated across firms.",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "As highlighted by Rosenbaum and Robin (1984) , the bias in the estimation of the treatment effects is proportional to the difference in the mean of the predicted probabilities of treatment across treated and control groups.",
    "For the sub-sample of exporters in the initial year of the sample, two out of the three matching techniques (Kernel and Stratification) yield statistically significant positive effects.",
    "Thus in Table 3a we report the results of two separate logit regressions.",
    "Data from global surveys of EPAs undertaken by the World Bank in 2005 and 2010 suggest that in all regions of the world the promotion of overall exports dominates other policy objectives (see Figure 1 ).",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Note: Multinomial logit and OLS coefficients reported.",
    "6 The results of these mean comparisons across key export promotion variables are provided in Table 6 .",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Note: Group means reported.",
    "For this approach to be valid, the underlying distribution of the predicted probabilities, the propensity score, should approach normality and the mean propensity score for the treated and control groups should be statistically similar.",
    "The World Bank's Enterprise surveys for 2006 and 2010 (www.enterprisesurveys.org) provide panel data for the following seven countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay.",
    "However, there are at least two problems with the findings reported in Tables 1 and 2 .",
    "For example, using this type of data Volpe and Carballo (2008) found in a sample of Peruvian firms that export promotion affects exports mainly along the extensive margin, both in terms of markets and products, but has little impact on the intensive margins of exports.",
    "Section 3 presents the empirical methodology and section 4 discusses the econometric results.",
    "Blundell and Costa Dias (2002) suggest that a combination of differences-in-differences with propensity matching can help solve the inherent bias in this type of program evaluation exercise.",
    "But this literature focuses on products at the tariff line level --see Evennett and Venables (2002) or Besedes and Prusa (2007) for papers showing that growth in the value of new export products or new export markets can account for a large share of export growth in developing countries.",
    "Section 2 describes the data and provides some prima-facie descriptive evidence.",
    "Using 2006 data (i.e., pre-treatment data), we use a Logit model to explain the probability that a firm used export promotion services.",
    "Results of the estimation of the multinomial logit explaining survival, entry, and continuous nonexporter status relative to exit (the worst transition in our setup) appear in the first three columns of Table 3 .",
    "Table   5 provides results using a similar difference-in-difference estimator with propensity score matching.",
    "Table 4 tend to confirm the results of Table 3 .",
    "Table 3 is that it allows us to compare the impact of using export promotion services on different transition probabilities with respect to a common outcome (in the case of Table 3 , we use as a reference exiting from an export market).",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.",
    "In order to confidently address the selection issue in the next section, we highlight results that are consistent across the three different propensity matching approaches.",
    "Regarding export intensity, the relevant results appear in the last two rows of each panel.",
    "Tables 5a-c are consistent with the Multinomial Logit results reported in Table 3 (and   the logit results in Table 4 ), although the results on export intensity are a bit stronger than those in Table 3 .",
    "Panel 5a provides estimates using Kernel matching, panel 5b using stratification matching and panel 5c nearest neighbor matching.",
    "Our variable of interest is whether the firm used the services of an EPA between 2006 and 2010.",
    "The penultimate row contains the results for the whole sample of firms, whereas the last row contains the results for the sub-sample of firms that were exporters in 2006.",
    "Concluding Remarks There is a growing literature on the impact of export promotion services and subsidies.",
    "There are a couple of exemptions, such as Bernard and Jensen (2004) and Gorg, Henry and Strobl (2008) , but these studies focused on developed countries (the U.S. and Ireland, respectively).",
    "The last column gives the t-statistic on the difference between treated and non-treated firms in the change in the share of exporting firms from 2006-2010.",
    "Although firm census data are scarce, especially in developing countries, it is safe to speculate that exporting is rare among firms.",
    "2 There is also an important literature that shows that the survival of new export \"relationships\" is an important determinant of export growth, at least in developing countries.",
    "To summarize the results in Table 3 , the use of export promotion services appears to be very significant in helping firms survive in export markets or become exporters, but it is not significant in causing firms to increase exports as a share of total sales.",
    "In our sample, we found 6 such blocks, but in the sixth block the degrees of freedom for the equality-of-means test was 2, thus yielding a low power test.",
    "Kernel density matching utilizes the distribution of the predicted probabilities of treatment to construct the treatment and control groups.",
    "And not only the share of exporters is higher among firms using export promotion services, but the increase in the share of exporters is larger for the sample of firms that used export promotion services, as indicated by the differences-in-differences test in the last column of Table 1 .",
    "Thus, the use of export promotion services seems to be correlated with firm entry into export activities or with a higher survival rate, since the share of exporters in the samples of firms that did not use EPA services declined between 2006 and 2010 in all countries, except Colombia.",
    "The last row in each table corresponds to estimations with the sub-sample of firms that were exporters in 2006.",
    "In addition, the surveys provide information on firm capabilities, such as whether firms have a website or use email to communicate with clients, which we used to control for changes in firm capabilities between 2006 and 2010.",
    "The last column gives the t-statistic on the difference between treated and non-treated firms in the change in export intensity from 2006-2010.",
    "Moreover, in five of the seven countries, the average export intensity of firms increased significantly more among firms that used export promotion services, as indicated by the differences-in-differences t-statistic in the last column.",
    "Exp_int is the firm's total exports as a fraction of total sales, treatment is a dummy for whether the firm used EPA services over the previous 3 years.",
    "There is also a growing literature using customs data on export promotion and their impact on exporting firms' intensive and extensive margins of exports, where the extensive margin is defined either as the introduction of new export products or entry into new export-market destinations.",
    "The aforementioned results seem to weakly contradict the findings of G\u00f6rg et al (2008) who in a sample of Irish firms found that grants tend to have an impact on the intensive margin, but not the extensive margin."
