    "In each of these regressions, the coefficient on the dummy for the UK (1870), US (1975) , and China (2008) yields the magnitude of over-trading or under-trading for the relevant country.",
    "Some parts of this section draw on ideas first presented inMattoo and Subramanian (2009).",
    "This section relies on joint research with Francis Ng.",
    "Source: Mattoo, Ng and Subramanian 2011A corollary of our analysis is that unless Chinese currency policy changes significantly, and unless there can be credible checks on the use of such policies in the future, the perception we outlined above will remain.",
    "Over and under-trading are derived from a regression of the relevant trade measure on population (column 2), population and per capita GDP (PPP) (column 3), population, per capita GDP (PPP) and a dummy for oil producers (column 4).",
    "the Cairns Group and the United States in 2000 and, more recently, Japan and Switzerland in 2008).",
    "See also WTO (2010) andStewart (2010).",
    "On the one hand, in a survey of studies on renminbi misalignment conducted by Cline and Williamson (2008) , 17 of the 18 studies concluded that the renminbi is undervalued; the average estimate of the undervaluation was 19 percent for the 2000-07 period as a whole and considerably higher for the 2004-07 period.",
    "For example, the level of imperial preferences in 1936 was about 6-12 percent and was estimated to be twice that level in the preceding decade (McDougall and Hutt, 1954) .",
    "6 The results are shown in Table 2 (for selected countries).",
    "The theoretical foundations of this so-called -gravity model\u2016 have been solidified in recent years (see Eaton and Kortum, 2002; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003; Subramanian and Wei, 2007; Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein, 2008) .",
    "2 These figures may exaggerate China's dominance because trade is measured in gross terms rather than valued added terms (see Johnson and Noguera, forthcoming).3 Across countries and sectors, China features consistently as the most important supplier and often by a substantial amount.",
    "As shown in Table 1 and discussed in Subramanian (2011) , within the next twenty years China is likely to be economically dominant: by 2030, its market-based GDP is projected to equal that of the US, its PPP-based GDP by then to be twice that of the US, China's trade in goods to be nearly two times that of the US and Europe, and the renminbi stands a good chance of nipping at the heels of the dollar, if not eclipsing it, as the main reserve currency.",
    "For example, as Table 5 shows, China accounts for 65 percent of world imports of iron ores and concentrates and 80 percent of its imports come from just three countries -Australia, Brazil and India.",
    "Fink and Molinuevo (2008) and Marchetti and Roy (2008) have shown that these agreements typically involve wider and deeper commitments than those which countries have made under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the WTO.",
    "On the other hand, Dunaway, Leigh, and Li (2006) argue that all estimates of renminbi undervaluation are very sensitive to underlying assumptions about models and parameters and therefore not reliable.",
    "However, we would first note that large parts of the current Doha Agenda, such as the market access negotiations in manufacturing, agriculture and services, as well as the domestic support issues in agriculture, remain relevant, perhaps even more so in the context of a rising China.",
    "To recap those numbers, the ratio of trade to GDP for the US rarely exceeded 15 percent during Pax Americana compared with China's current ratio of 57 percent (Table 3) .",
    "In fact, in the bid to bring the larger developing countries into the fold through the -single-undertaking,\u2016 a large number of small and poor countries were also swept up -a form of -democratic overshooting\u2016 that we return to in the conclusion.",
    "A response to this dependence has been investment abroad, in a bid to secure long-term access to resources.",
    "Post-mortems of the failing Doha negotiations, for example by Schwab (2011) , have highlighted the divergent interests of the new powers (notably China and India) and the traditional ones (such as the EU and US).",
    "1 Figure 1 presents the results.",
    "The new issues we are proposing-by no means comprehensive or exhaustiveoffer a greater chance for reciprocity to work.",
    "Whether countries are willing to go so far depends, first, on how much need there is to make a down-payment to China in terms of improved relative market access (by eliminating the adverse preference margins it currently faces) to induce it to further open its markets.",
    "3 For example, China's share in these sectors in Japan is over 70 percent, in Korea over 60 percent, in Brazil about 55 percent, in the United States, Canada, and the European Union about 50 percent each.",
    "China has applied for accession to the Agreement, and while Anderson (2008) notes that -work on the accession of China, while obviously a complex and challenging undertaking, is progressing well,\u2016 it is evidently not an easy negotiation.",
    "The OECD report suggests that in absolute figures, China's subsidies to farmers were higher than those of the United States, and even in terms of the proportion that subsidies contributes to farm income, China's was at 17 percent in 2010, over twice that of the United States' 7 percent.",
    "The case for a multilateral approach is clear.",
    "For example, in the United States, China has by far the highest share of imports in eight out of the ten most protected sectors, ranging from 22 percent in man-made fibers (HS 55) to 76 percent in footwear (HS 64).",
    "According to Borchert, Gootiz and Mattoo (2011), China's services sector policies are more restrictive than the average level of restrictiveness of low and middle income countries and much more so than those of the high income countries in all sectors except transport (Figure 4 ).",
    "For instance, the U.S. ITC (2011) estimated, based on a survey of more than five thousand U.S. IP-intensive firms, that the losses to U.S. industry from IPR infringement in China totaled roughly $48 billion in 2009 and that U.S. companies spent nearly $5 billion that year to combat this infringement.",
    "It has been shown that such action would imply average tariffs on merchandise imports from India and China of over 20 percent and would depress their manufacturing exports between 16 and 21 percent (Mattoo, Ng, and Subramanian, 2009) .",
    "From an analytical perspective, it is important to note that the shifts in trade are likely to be a direct consequence of the shifts in the economy via the -gravity\u2016 effect.",
    "The corresponding figures for industrial countries were 11 and 27 percent, respectively.",
    "In many of the importing countries (e.g., Brazil, the European Union, and the United States), China's share has more than doubled.",
    "But the intertemporal link may lie in a combination of reputational considerations, durability of international legal frameworks and the path-dependence of economic integration.",
    "This -shock\u2016 of the economic transformation of a large number of developing countries meant that the previous equilibrium whereby developing countries were left out of the GATT process needed to be revisited.",
    "Here it is relevant that China's dominance will be associated at least initially not with technological leadershipas in the case of its predecessors Britain and the US but with technological catch-up.",
    "14 Not surprisingly, WTO members that depend heavily on world markets for food have pushed for disciplines on export controls and taxes (e.g.Japan and Switzerland in 2000, and Congo, Jordan, and Korea in 2001).",
    "scandium and yttrium) it accounts for more than 70 percent of the world's exports, as well as of other key raw materials, such as various forms of bauxite, magnesium, and zinc, where again it accounts for a large share of world exports.",
    "Then, when the US started to feel the discriminatory effects of European integration, and in order to mitigate these effects, it pushed strongly for reductions in MFN tariffs under various -rounds\u2016 of multilateral trade negotiations.",
    "As Figure 5 shows, a large proportion of its FDI flowsin 2009, as much as 70 percentis in natural resources.",
    "But a closer look reveals that many of these agreements have had a limited impact in creating preferential trade (WTO, 2011) reflected in the fact that only 16 per cent of goods trade actually takes place on preferential terms.",
    "But there are two critical differences: China is trade dependent in a way that the US or even Germany never was, and moreover, given China's low levels of income, China's stake in openness might be greater because its rise to prosperity, on which is predicated the legitimacy of its government, will depend upon an open system.",
    "To illustrate this, we identify for each of the top ten trading partners, the ten most protected sectors (defined at the Harmonized Schedule (HS) 2-digit level of aggregation in 2009 in terms of the MFN tariff alone).",
    "Second, the challenges for an open system from the -decline of the west\u2016 should not be underestimated.",
    "In this respect, China seems to be conforming to a broader trend whereby countries, as they become richer, switch from taxing to subsidizing agriculture.",
    "Only about 6 percent of its exports enjoy preferential accesswhich is significantly below the world average, and low compared to other large traders, such as the European Union (13 percent), United States (22 percent), India (26 percent) and Brazil (15 percent) (Table 4) .",
    "WTO Document WT/TPR/S/230, World Trade Organization, 4 June 2010.",
    "15 Most medium term projections assume high and rising energy prices-fueled by rising demand in emerging market economies such as China and India and uncertainties about available supplies created or rather resuscitated fears about energy security."
