    "\u2022 December 2013 23(6) Table 6 .",
    "Majsztrik (2011) , which contained information base on site visits to operations in Maryland.",
    "Other articles in this series highlight project results that document the economic benefits provided by these systems (Belayneh et al., 2013; Chappell et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) .",
    "Values for the equivalency of each of the energy sources and the quantity of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emitted as they are consumed were used to convert the quantities of fuel to megagrams of CO 2 emissions (U.S. EPA, 2013b).",
    "1 (National Research Council, 1997).",
    "Total regional reduction in CO 2 emissions was calculated using\nwhere C is the annual reduction in megagrams of CO 2 emissions associated with the use of WSIN for operation type j in region k. C is equal to A, the average number of liters applied per hectare annually in operation type j in region k converted to hectare-meters, times D, the assumed percent reduction in water use associated with using WSIN, times E, the weighted sum of megagrams CO 2 emissions for all energy sources in region k, times B, the average number of hectares per operation of type j in region k, times O, the number of operations of type j in region k.\nThe potential magnitude of greenhouse gas emission reduction associated with the adoption of WSIN technology is illustrated in Table 2 .",
    "Water use in container and field operations were estimated by adjusting FRIS open field data using proportions derived from Majsztrik (2011), as detailed above.",
    "\u2022 December 2013 23(6) Table 7 .",
    "Runoff estimates for baseline conditions Table 1 .",
    "To arrive at these average values, we estimated total business sales for each operation type using regional sales data for horticultural operations from the USDA Census of Agriculture: Census of Horticultural Specialties (USDA, 2010b) and then adjusted for each operation type according to the proportions of operations in each operation type derived from a survey of ornamental plant producers that was completed as part of this project .",
    "Greenhouse and container production practices across the country are likely to be similar to Maryland so the values reported in Table 5 for those WSIN applications are likely to be representative.",
    "The FRIS data also contain state-scale information on the types of fuel used to power wells, so relative use of diesel, gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and propane was calculated at the regional scale, and standard conversions from diesel to other fuel types were used to calculate the quantity of each fuel type needed to pump a hectare-meter of water, given regional well characteristics.",
    "Briefly, the models used average N and P rates applied by greenhouse, container, and field growers in Maryland to derive baseline runoff rates for the scenarios reported here.",
    "These impacts of WSIN use should result in economic returns on investments high enough to expect relatively high adoption rates of this technology (Belayneh et al., 2013; Chappell et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) .",
    "(2013) and our best professional judgment for larger scale reductions in nutrient application and runoff (Tables 3 and 4) .",
    "The magnitude of potential environmental benefits per region, and overall for the United States, are presented in Table 7 .",
    "Also, WSIN allow growers to store historical, quantitative information from past days and weeks to show trends, overlay weather information and data, and incorporate other information to improve water and nutrient management decisions.",
    "Since environmental benefits realized from WSIN technologies will depend critically on adoption rates, this project has sought to develop intuitive and user-friendly WSIN that meets the needs of a large majority of potential end users (Kohanbash and Kantor, 2012; Kohanbash et al., 2013) .",
    "For this reason, we are not reporting P runoff reduction for field operations because the modeled scenarios based on the data currently available, which are for Maryland, are not likely to be representative of the country.",
    "Second, the rate and extent of adoption during Stage 10 will depend, to a large extent, on the availability of information about potential private benefits during Stage 9 as described in Lichtenberg et al.",
    "Estimates of regional energy use for pumping irrigation water were calculated using data on average regional well characteristics from FRIS data.",
    "Assumed reductions in application rates for ''with WSIN'' conditions for both scenarios were estimated using results from Chappell et al.",
    "Table 8 shows the potential reduction in N and P runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed for different adoption rates of WSIN technology, according to the assumptions described above with respect to the ''optimistic scenario.''",
    "For technologies whose benefits are clearly demonstrated in early trials (Stages 8 and 9), rates of adoption and the accrual of related benefits during Stage 10 usually follow an S-shaped path, as illustrated in Fig.",
    "\u2022 December 2013 23 (6) were calculated by multiplying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application rates on a variety of crops in greenhouse, container and field operations (Majsztrik, 2011) by the estimated runoff rate for each operation type based on the output of models developed by Majsztrik (2011) .",
    "Future work will focus on estimating WSIN-based N and P reductions in field operations nationwide.",
    "We are also likely to be underestimating N reductions from WSIN in field operations for the same reason, but we include estimates of N reductions in Table 5 .",
    "Using WSIN to generate monitoring data provides opportunities to both promote public awareness and validate the effectiveness of green roofs, particularly when sensor networks are scaled up to provide information on a watershed scale.",
    "Research results have established that applications of WSIN in at least some situations generate significant private (economic) benefits to growers (Belayneh et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013) , and a national survey indicates that growers have positive perceptions of sensor networks .",
    "Assuming an average of 4.8 Mg of CO 2 emissions per motor vehicle per year (U.S. EPA, 2013b), this is equivalent to eliminating the annual CO 2 emissions of %7500 cars.",
    "The most fully developed of these applications involve using wireless sensor networks to monitor and validate the effectiveness of green roofs in achieving various environmental goals, and to better inform green roof design, especially with regard to plant selection for storm water remediation (Starry, 2013) .",
    "T is equal to R, the reduction in consumption, emissions, or runoff (l) for operation type j in region k, times O is the number of operations of type j in region k, divided by S, the total sales of operation type j in region k. The average magnitudes of potential environmental benefits per million dollars of output for each operation type per region, and for the United States, are presented in Table 6 .",
    "The number of liters of water applied per hectare of greenhouse operations was derived from the Horticultural Operations section of the USDA Census of Agriculture FRIS (USDA, 2010a).",
    "Other assumptions regarding percent reductions in water use and regional adoption rates were used to test the sensitivity of results.",
    "Potential regional and national environmental benefits associated with reductions in N, P, water, and CO 2 emissions were demonstrated using a number of sources.",
    "A dedicated website and knowledge center has been developed to disseminate project information and results, and inform people about how to use and maximize the benefits from this type of technology (LeaCox, 2013 ).",
    "This standard approach allows these benefits to be estimated using generally available information about the size and type of operations rather than often-unavailable operationscale information about water and energy use or air and water emissions.",
    "For illustration purposes, we apply basic BMP cost information to the region that makes up the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which sets limits on N, P, and sediment entering receiving waters.",
    "First, the environmental benefits that will result from WSIN technologies during Stage 10 will depend on the rate or speed of adoption (the slope of the S curve), and on the extent or ceiling of adoption (where the S curve levels out).",
    "1 based on the technology development curve created by King (1992) .",
    "For example, growers considering shifting to WSIN will initially need access to consultants, extension agents, or other growers who are familiar with WSIN technologies to help them design and calibrate systems for their specific applications.",
    "Nationwide reductions in annual nutrient discharges associated with a 50% adoption of WSIN are estimated to range from 282,000 to 603,000 kg for N and from 182,000 to 378,000 kg for P. Nitrogen and especially P values are likely to be underestimated in Table 5 because the baseline values that were used were based on data related to ornamental growers in Maryland, which operate under relatively strict nutrient discharge limits to reduce environmental impacts to the Chesapeake Bay.",
    "The typical sequence of development in complex applications of new technologies, such as no-till farming or microprocessing, is depicted in Fig.",
    "However, besides nominal cost savings associated with reduced water use, WSIN installations showed that soil moisture and other data resulted in significant reductions in input use, which produced significant revenue increases associated with improved crop growth and yields.",
    "The analysis and results presented here are based on the assumption that no additional land is used for ornamental production.",
    "\u2022 December 2013 23 (6) the Chesapeake Bay region suggests that a 50% adoption rate of WSIN technology would result in %32,000 kg less N and %19,000 kg less P being discharged into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and with a 100% adoption rate %64,000 kg less N and %38,000 kg less P discharged.",
    "Rates and levels of WSIN adoption, and associated private and environmental benefits, will also depend on other factors relating to growers access to information, risk tolerance, and the availability of technological advice and financing (Feder et al., 1985; Sunding and Zilberman, 2001 ).",
    "Using WSIN not only to reduce water use and water and carbon emissions but to monitor and validate those reductions may also result in these reductions being more valuable in terms of generating marketable offsets or credits in various regional emission and water trading programs."
