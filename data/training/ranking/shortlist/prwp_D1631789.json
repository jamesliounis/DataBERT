    "The paper is organized as follows.",
    "Our analysis relies on daily data that covers the period from January 1997 to March 2000 and is drawn, for the most part, from Bloomberg, IDC and Baseline.",
    "Including a lagged depende-it variable in the various specifications fixes this problem as evidenced by Durbin and Watson d statistics close to 2.00 or the results of our robust test for serial correlation (see Table 2 ).",
    "The last regression reported in Table 2 The results in Table 4 and diagnostic testing reveal that first differences in the independent variables including Kepco spreads lead to inferior statistical performance so that we keep them in levels except for the rating variable KRR.",
    "Whenever we found missing observations, we cross-checked the time series with other news sources and filled in the missing data or, if this was not possible, deleted the observation leaving 725 observations before taking lags.",
    "As a robustness check, we repeat the analysis with weekly closing data (140 observations) but report the results only for major specifications ( Table 8 in the Appendix).",
    "I POLIcY RESEARCH WORKING PAPER 2712",
    "It turns out that the regression residuals exhibit high serial correlation for any number of explanatory variables and their lags (specification 1, Table 2 ).",
    "This paper represents a first attempt to fill this gap in the literature.",
    "While the theoretical foundations of project finance have received some attention in the literature (see, e.g., Shah and Thakor, 1987 , Berkovitch and Kim, 1990 , Chemmanur and .lohn, 1996 there are very few empirical studies of project finance.",
    "See Tuffano (2001) for a discussion of the merits and importance of clinical studies in this respect.",
    "This paper also contributes to the nascent empirical literature on structural models of credit spreads.",
    "4 See, e.g.,Smith and Warner (1979),Green (1984) andJohn (1987) for more on this point.",
    "Table 4 reports the most informative regression specifications.",
    "Specification 1 2 3 4 5 6 Original Table 2  Table 2  Table 4  Table 4  Table 5 As a robustness check, this table reports the estimation results for major specifications with weekly data.",
    "S pecification .2 3 4 5 6 Original Table 2  Table 2  Table 2  Table 4  Table 5  Tasle",
    "In terms of structural modeling, we avail ourselves of the results in Madan and Unal (2000) who derive credit spreads as a fumction of firm-specific variables in a hazard rate framework.",
    "Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, we find that off-taker credit quality and, more importantly, the market's assessment of the output buyer's economic prospects drive project bond credit spreads and the:r pricing.",
    "Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, we relate Ras Gas credit spreads to their own lags, to current and lagged Kepco credit spreads, to a crude oil reference price used to settle LNG sales (13rent), Korean control variables, and the current and lagged returns on four regional emerging debt market indices (contagion and spillover effects) in a linear regression framework.",
    "Section 4 contains a description of the data and our methodology.",
    "In Sections 5 and 6, we summarize the results of our empirical analysis.",
    "Our analysis is also related to the literature on bond covenants going back to Smith and Warner (1979) .",
    "From a methodological point of view, our analysis draws on the theoretical framework of Madan and Unal (2000) whose structural model of the hazard (default) rate implies that credit spreads are linearly related to firm-specific exogenous variables.",
    "Specifically, we test for unit roots in the residuals drawn from the corresponding cointegration equation, i.e.. y, = f6o + Ax,r + \u00a3r, A\u00a3, = ao + (a-)\u00a3 + A\u00a3,_, + it, The one-sided asymptotic P-values for the zr statistic (both in bold face) under the null hypothesis (existence of unit root or cointegrated time series) are computed by the methods described in MacKinnon (1994) .",
    "For ease of comparison, we indicate the closest corresponding specifications in the preceding tables (Original Specification).",
    "Esty and Megginson (2000) , who analyze how political risk shapes the syndication process and pricing of project loans, complement our findings from a private debt perspective.",
    "Given the high frequency of the data, it comes as no surprise that daily credit spreads exhibit a large degree of persistence: the coefficient on lagged spreads is close to unity (Table 2 ).",
    "The picture changes for credit spread changes because decomposed oil prices become statistically significant as compared to the non-decomposed variable (see Table 4 , specification 8).",
    "While we obtain results that, by and large, mirror the ones in Table 5 , several new effects appear.",
    "As before (see Table 4 ), levels of the explanatory variables perform better than their differences with the exception of the rating variable KRR and the Kepco spread KORELES (Table 6, specifications and 2 vs. 3 or 4).",
    "Campbell and Perron (1991) have pointed out that unit root tests are biased in favor of the null hypothesis (existence of a unit root) if the time series suffers from structural breaks such as the emerging market crises of1997-1998.",
    "However, tests for unit roots (see Table 3 ) appear inconclusive given the very low statistical power of such tests26 so that we treat the time series as stationary, albeit highly persistent.",
    "Table 7 summarizes the results for our four main specifications after substituting in for BRENT from the preceding expression.",
    "21 Gas prices turn out to be statistically non-significant when included in the regressions together with Brent prices, which is not really surprising given that about 0.",
    "Buying patterns as communicated to us by Goldman Sachs (Greg Randolph Ras Gas spreads and Middle-Eastern bond returns also offers support for such clientele based explanations (specifications 3 to 6, Table 8 ).",
    "Second, our study highlights the interdependence of debt finance and risk distribution recently identified in the context of hedging by Mello and Parsons (2000) .",
    "Consequently, we take as our dependent variable the mid-closing spread of the 2013 Ras Gas bond yield over the 10 year benchmark US Treasury yield.",
    "Furthermore, our results highlight the interdependence of debt finance and risk distribution recently identified in the context of hedging by Mello and Parsons (2000) .",
    "2 Brealey, Cooper and Habib (1996) contains an excellent survey of the economic issues involved in project finance.",
    "As a result, our analysis reconciles continuous time corporate default models with the dominant view of the firm in corporate finance and provides evidence in favor of the Madan and Unal (2000) default risk model.",
    "We interpret this result, which holds for the full set of explanatory variables as well as subsets (see specifications 3 and 4 in Table 5 ), as evidence that investors discount the direct revenue effect of output prices on Ras Gas due to Mobil's guarantee.",
    "In terms of estimation strategy, we start with the two key contract variables depicted in Exhibit 5, the output (Brent oil reference) price and Kepco bond yield spreads, and successively add explanatory variables to the regression.",
    "The view of the firm as a nexus of contracts, first formulated in the seminal papers by Alchian and Demsetz (1972) and Jensen and Meckling (1976) , underlies much of modern corporate finance.",
    "To this end, Ras Gas has constructed a 5.2 MMTA (million metric tons per annum) 5 The following project description draws on its bond offering prospectus (Goldman Sachs, 1996) , Standard and Poor's (1996a , 1999 and Randolph and Schrantz (1997) .",
    "While the theoretical foundations of project finance have received some attention in the literature there are very few empirical studies of project finance.",
    "Section 6 repeats the analysis in a simultaneous equation framework to explicitly take into account the bilateral monopoly and to separate direct from indirect risk effects acting through their impact on Kepco.",
    "24 To gauge these effects, we construct a rating index (KRR) that reflects not only the changes in S&P credit ratings but also their magnitude.",
    "For more on current LNG trading trends, seeBanaszak (2001).",
    "In Table 6 , we replicate the simultaneous equation analysis in first differences.",
    "Nevertheless, we also estimate our basic model in first differences to address potential non-stationarity problems."
