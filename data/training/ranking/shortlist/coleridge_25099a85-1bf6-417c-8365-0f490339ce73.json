  "shortlist": [
    "Observed CI has been calculated from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) data set which contains temperature and salinity profiles from 1955 to 2012 [Locarnini et al., 2013;Zweng et al., 2013].",
    "[2012a] on the basis of a global analysis.",
    "The Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 regional distribution and annual variation of the CI reduction (Figure 8d) largely reflects the changes in TCHP and 100 m mean temperature.",
    "TC tracks and intensities have been obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [Knapp et al., 2010].",
    "Again, the relevant annual mean values are summarized in Table 1.",
    "[2007], who observed temperature Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 inversions of up to 0.6 C in the plume area.",
    "[2012], the impact of the total BL in the WTNA (river, precipitation and subduction induced) on CI can be estimated by comparing the standard CI in the Clear-River experiment, to a CI computed at constant salinity (33.85 PSU).",
    "The mean annual cycle of Amazon and Orinoco discharge ( Figure 1) is derived from the Global Runoff Data Center [(GRDC)/Federal Institute of Hydrology/ Germany, and International Hydrological Programme/ United Nations Educational/ Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2001], which provide monthly discharge measured at various stations along the rivers.",
    "[2012a], comparing TC intensification in color-affected and clear regions, could prove to be useful in the future.",
    "The spatial distribution and magnitude is very similar to the model results ( Figure 5c).",
    "CI explicitly takes into account the density stratification in the ocean and is a key metric in this paper.",
    "That agrees with Masson and Delecluse [2001] and Balaguru et al.",
    "[2007] and de Boyer Mont egut et al.",
    "In this paper we have separated the effects of river freshwater input and light attenuation on ocean stratification and temperatures in the Amazon and Orinoco plume area.",
    "As Vialard and Delecluse [1998] pointed out, the warming effect of decoupling the ML from the deep ocean is competing with cooling due to solar penetration.",
    "Satellite observed SSTs (Figure 3b) are produced daily by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) at the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) using optimal interpolation from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) Pathfinder Version 5 data [Reynolds et al., 2007].",
    "The 6 hourly NCEP CFSR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction; Climate System Forecast Reanalysis) data are used for the atmospheric boundary conditions [Saha et al., 2010], namely 2 m temperature and moisture, 10 m winds, precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation, and cloud coverage.",
    "[2012b], the impact of stratification on surface cooling is relatively small for CIs exceeding 30 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , and more important for low CIs.",
    "According to Vincent et al.",
    "Annual mean changes of relevant parameters and their standard deviations are given in Table 1.",
    "[2012b] Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans",
    "[2002] showed local shoaling of the thermocline by up to 18 m in the Amazon plume area, which is in agreement with our findings.",
    "The coefficients are calculated applying the updated version [Lee et al., 2009] of the quasi analytical algorithm, developed by Lee et al.",
    "The annual and area mean TCHP in the model is 48.2 kJ/cm 2 .",
    "Ffield [2007] observed that 68% of all WTNA category 5 TCs pass over the plume area and thus suggest circumstantial evidence of a relationship, assuming that the plume is responsible for warm SST anomalies.",
    "[2012] observe a reduction of 18.4/13.6 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 in CI for a surface freshening of 22.2/21.5 PSU in the northeastern Bay of Bengal/East Indian Coast.",
    "DT Eye is then translated into intensity reduction using the linear relationship found by Schade [2000]: Their analysis suggests that a 2.5 C temperature drop may be sufficient to shut down a cyclone completely, DI is therefore normalized to 2.5 C. Figure 11 shows DT Eye as a function of WPi for the mean June-November CI in the TC-box for each experiment.",
    "[2009] on the other hand report a slight warming (10.1 C) of the Bay of Bengal associated with freshwater discharge, and Park et al.",
    "Combined monthly fields of Rrs at 9 km horizontal resolution from Terra and Aqua MODIS at 443 nm, 488 nm, 555 nm and 667 nm from 2000 to 2010 were obtained [Feldman and McClain, 2014].",
    "Note that the Aquarius data are only for 1 year, but the interannual variability of the plume size can be very large [Grodsky et al., 2014].",
    "Morel and Antoine [1994] and Ohlmann [2003] have overcome this by parameterizing attenuation coefficients as a function of surface chlorophyll concentration, available from satellite observations.",
    "The Net TCHP change is a reduction similar to Figure 8c in terms of seasonal and spatial distribution (not shown).",
    "It is derived by applying a first order fit on the relationship of modeled wake cooling to WPi and CI [Vincent et al., 2012b]: (2) with c 0 ,c 1 ,c 2 , and c 3 being the fit parameters.",
    "While CDOM commonly has terrestrial sources (eg.",
    "Subsurface cooling due to modified light absorption in model studies has been previously reported [Lin et al., 2008;Gnanadesikan and Anderson, 2009].",
    "In our model domain 6396 temperature and 2219 salinity profiles have been available.",
    "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 2.2.1.",
    "The June and July maps show small areas of increasing (decreasing) CI of up to 16 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 (24 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ) in magnitude.",
    "According to this estimate, salinity stratification increases CI by about 8.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , of which only about 27% are caused by the Amazon and Orinoco.",
    "Emanuel  32.6 6 1.0 34.5 6 1.0 31.9 6 1.1 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 [1987] finds that under typical conditions the MPI at 29 C SST is about 891 hPa.",
    "Similarly, Howden and Murtugudde [2001] saw a slight surface cooling (20.1 C) in the Bay of Bengal caused by rivers and White and Toumi [2014] report that the Congo plume has no effect on SSTs.",
    "Applying a downscaling approach Emanuel [2006] has shown, that a 10% increase in thermocline depth results in 4% more intense TCs.",
    "From the CFSR data it can be seen, that the mean sea level pressure over the WTNA varies between about 1012 hPa and 1018 hPa (not shown).",
    "[2012a], the eye cooling (DT Eye ) is here defined as the SST cooling 112 h after compared to 212 h before TC passage averaged over a 200 km 3 200 km box around the TC position.",
    "The spatial distribution of the June to November TCHP is roughly a reflection of the warm pool ( Figure 5a).",
    "Satellite observed surface salinity for 2012 from Aquarius (Level 3, V2.0) [Lagerloef, 2012] shows a similar extent and seasonal cycle as the model (Figure 3b).",
    "The intensity reduction (DI) is a measure for a TC's relative deviation from MPI and is defined in Section 2.3.",
    "[2014], and can be explained by stronger TCs inducing more cooling.",
    "[2007] modeled an annual mean SST increase of up to 10.2 C and 10.8 C respectively in the Amazon and Orinoco plume area when accounting for chlorophyll absorption.",
    "To show the effect of ocean color on TC intensity in observations, a study similar to Balaguru et al."
