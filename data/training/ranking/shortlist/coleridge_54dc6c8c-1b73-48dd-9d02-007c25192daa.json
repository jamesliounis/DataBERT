    "We encounter multi-source or multi-modality data frequently in many real data applications.",
    "We also investigate the performance of the proposed method under high-dimensional situations in the following Setting 2.",
    "Specifically, the proposed method is more powerful in handling informative missing data since the MBI reduces selection bias through aggregating more samples across different missing pattern groups than a single regression imputation based on complete cases.",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "In general, the proposed method achieves higher variable selection and prediction accuracy than all other methods for the ADNI data due to incorporating correlation information from incomplete observations.",
    "The simulation results for the unstructured correlation matrix are provided in the supplementary material.",
    "We first simulate data from a multivariate normal distribution with correlation \u03c1 similarly as in previous settings, and then transform each covariate X j in Source 1 to sign(X j ).",
    "Sources 1, 2, and 3 contain 2, 6, and 7 relevant covariates, respectively.",
    "Sources 1, 2, and 3 contain 4, 3, and 3 relevant covariates, respectively.",
    "For instance, for Group 2 in Figure 1 , the above method treats the covariates in Sources 1 and 2 as predictors and ignores information from Source 3.",
    "Table 4 shows that the proposed method has the smallest FNR+FPR and MSE among all the methods under Setting 4, indicating that the proposed method performs better than other competing methods in both variable selection and coefficient estimation under the situations with binary covariates.",
    "Alternatively, the direct sparse regression procedure using covariance from multi-modality data (DIS-COM) [53] estimates the covariance matrices among predictors and between the response and predictors.",
    "Such multi-source data are also common for electronic medical record (EMR) systems adopted by most health care and medical facilities nowadays, which contain diverse-source patient information, e.g., demographics, medication status, laboratory tests, medical imaging and text notes.",
    "In Setting 3, the probability of a missing sample depends on missing covariates and the response variable, which leads to informative missingness and biased imputation based on the complete group in SI-SCAD.",
    "For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 , the observed values of Source 1 covariates in Group 2 are utilized in the estimation of bothX",
    "Numerical studies and ADNI data application confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing variable selection methods under various missing mechanisms.",
    "Tables 7 and 8 to the presence of AD [22, 1, 4, 47, 46, 12, 48] .",
    "Since Groups 1, 3 and 4 contain observed values of X m (2) and covariates in Source 2 or 3, G(2) = {1, 3, 4} and M 2 = 3.",
    "Numerical studies and the ADNI data application also confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing variable selection methods for block-wise missing data in missing completely at random, missing at random, and informative missing scenarios.",
    ", S. Figure 1 illustrates a setting with three sources.",
    "Second, the proposed method is capable of handling block-wise missing data which might not contain any complete observations, while most traditional methods, including the matrix completion [5] , require partial subjects to have fully completed observations.",
    "The proposed method improves variable selection accuracy through incorporating more information about missing covariates from incomplete case groups.",
    "The proposed method is more powerful in variable selection than other methods under the high-dimensional situations, as its FNR+FPR is the smallest among all the methods, as indicated in Table 2 .",
    "Specifically, Table 6 shows that the mean RMSE of the proposed method is smaller than that of any other method under two missing rates, even though the proposed method selects fewer variables than most of the other methods, which implies that the proposed method selects variables more accurately.",
    "The ADNI data contain multi-source measurements: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), florbetapir-fluorine-18 (AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) PET imaging, biosamples, gene expression, and demographic information.",
    "In this section, we provide simulation studies to compare the proposed method with existing model selection approaches for handling block-wise missing data, including complete case analysis with the SCAD penalty (CC-SCAD), the single imputation with SCAD penalty (SI-SCAD), the iSFS, the DISCOM, and the DISCOM with Huber's M-estimate (DISCOM-Huber).",
    "Let\nand H A N (\u03b2) be sub-matrices of H(\u03b2) consisting of rows corresponding to covariates indexed by A S and A N , respectively, where\ndenotes the first derivative of G(\u03b2) with respect to \u03b2 j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p. We also let we write w.p.a.1 as shorthand for \"with probability approaching one.\"",
    "However, Groups 3 and 4, also containing values from Source 3, can provide additional information in imputing missing variables X m(r) through correlations with other covariates.",
    "In total, there are 300 features and 223 subjects in four groups with 69 complete observations, that is, p = 300, N = 223, and R = 4, where the four groups have the same missing pattern structure as Groups 1-4 in Figure 1 .",
    "For example, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data involve multisite longitudinal observational data from elderly individuals with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's Disease (AD) [36, 35] .",
    "Therefore, it is important to fully integrate data from all complementary sources to improve model prediction and variable selection.",
    "The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves higher model selection accuracy than other competing methods through fully utilizing information from incomplete samples.",
    "We simulate data from a linear model (1) using 50 replications, where \u03b5 \u223c N (0, I N ) and each row of X is independent and identically distributed from a normal distribution with mean 0 and an exchangeable covariance matrix determined by a variance parameter \u03c3 2 = 1 and a covariance parameter \u03c1.",
    "As the missing rate of this dataset is nearly 70%, it is important to fully utilize incomplete observations such as with the proposed method.",
    "However, Source 3 covariates could be incorporated as well, since they are relevant to the response variable.",
    "In this example, there are three sources and four groups with p 1 = p 2 = p 3 = 20 and n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = n 4 = 1000, where each source contains one relevant\nThe objective function f * (\u03b2).",
    "In this paper, we propose a homogeneous model to account for observations across all the missing patterns.",
    "Suppose that all the covariates in X are from S sources where the k-th source contains p k covariates for k = 1, .",
    ", R, through combining informative estimating equations, e.g., utilizing the first several largest principle components (PCs) [50, 10] .",
    "If the r-th group only has complete observations, then G(r) = {r}, M r = 1 and\nNote that the total number of equations exceeds the number of coefficient parameters, and estimating functions from groups with fewer missing variables or more accurate imputations tend to have smaller variance.",
    "More precisely, the proposed method reduces the RMSE of any Table 6 : The \"NS\" represents the mean number of selected variables.",
    "To integrate information from the multi-source observed data we propose a Multiple Blockwise Imputation (MBI) approach, incorporating not only the SI based on complete observations but also imputations from incomplete observations.",
    "In this paper, we utilize the GLM [37] to accommodate not only continuous covariates but also discrete covariates.",
    "We show that the proposed method has estimation and model selection consistency under both fixed-dimensional and high-dimensional settings.",
    "For each 1 \u2264 r \u2264 R and k \u2208 G(k), letX (r,k) be the completed data in Group r using imputed values based on Group k, andX (r,k) be the samples in Group r but with missing values in the i-th sample replaced by E(X m(r) |X iJ(r,k) ).",
    "In particular, the proposed method performs especially effectively when correlations among covariates are as strong as 0.8, with FNR+FPR = 0.251, much smaller than any FNR+FPR of other methods.",
    "If there are no missing values in the r-th group, let G(r) = {r}, a completely observed dataset.",
    "Sections 6 and 7 provide numerical studies through simulations and the ADNI data application.",
    "Moreover, the FNR+FPR of the proposed method decreases as \u03c1 increases, indicating that incorporating correlation information among covariates plays an important role in imputation especially when there are no complete cases.",
    "In the following section, we propose a new imputation approach to fully utilize information not only from the group with complete cases but also from other groups."
