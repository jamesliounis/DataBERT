    "In this paper, we use the 2004 ISSP 6 household survey data to provide an overview of energy consumption patterns in Montenegro and examine the likely impacts of electricity tariff reforms on household welfare.",
    "Note: this table is based on the discussion in Komives et.",
    "Such data are not available in the survey data we use in this paper, so we are not able to investigate this relationship.",
    "Ideally we would want to have data on household consumption of electricity at different price levels to estimate the demand for electricity.",
    "A more detailed analysis follows, examining the pattern of energy consumption geographically, by income quintile groups, and across socioeconomic groups.",
    "As the first two columns of Table 9 show, the estimated model predicts the proportion of households using each alternative remarkably well.",
    "2 In Scenarios 1 and 2 we calculated from the household survey data that this is the amount that would need to be financed either by the government or the energy company in scenarios where it is not covered by a cross-subsidy from high volume to low volume consumers.",
    "The evidence presented in this paper suggests that the impact of electricity tariff reforms on household choice of space heating fuels and the level of fuelwood consumption should be carefully monitored.",
    "The results of the multinomial logit model are reported in Table 8 .",
    "24 See Barnes, D.F., Krutilla, K., Hyde, W. 2004 income levels may lead to bias estimates.",
    "However, one may be concerned that the inclusion of income and household characteristics which may partly determine 20 Lampietti, Julian, Anthony Kolb, Sumila Gulyani, and Vahram Avenesyan (2001) .",
    "In Scenario 1 high volume consumers, who are also the highest income consumers, receive the largest monthly subsidy (Figure 4 and Appendix Table 3 ).",
    "Table 3 presents the results of the analysis of welfare losses associated with higher electricity prices.",
    "Since we do not have data about the feasibility of switching to fuelwood, our model may over predict the extent switching to fuelwood occurs.",
    "To assess the predictive accuracy of the model we first compare the actual proportion of household using each fuel observed in the data with the multinomial logit model's prediction.",
    "As shown in Table 5 , there is a trade-off between coverage and targeting.",
    "The assumptions of the policy scenarios considered here are summarized in Table 6 .",

    "Review of Lessons and Experience.",
    "Table 1 reports wood and electricity expenditures as a percentage of total household expenditures for households in different income groups and regions.",
    "World Bank Technical Paper No.",
    "We select households that use only electricity as the base case scenario and report the variables which affect full or partial use of fuelwood for space heating.",
    "Also, we want to be able to examine the trade offs between the two main sources of heating energy used during the winter months in Montenegro, which are electricity and fuelwood.",
    "A survey of household electricity expenditures in other eastern European and central Asian countries, shown in Figure 2 , reveals a similar pattern of electricity expenditure shares between low and high income households.",
    "As a consequence of this strong correlation, an IBT or a VDT will be better targeted in Montenegro than in most other countries.",
    "23 Household per capita expenditures are used instead of income, due to a large number of missing observations on reported income.",
    "The third column of Table 9 shows the predicted impact of higher electricity prices on household fuel choice.",
    "Total subsidy (tax) received or paid by households by income category (million Euro/year) deciles of total per capita household expenditures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Total Total subsidy (tax), million Euro per year Scenario 1 3.1 3.3 2.5 3.0 2.9 3.3 2.9 3.6 3.2 4.8 32.6 Scenario 2 2.0 1.8 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.3 1.2 1.2 14.1 Scenario 3",
    "We thus include in the analysis housing characteristics such as: dwelling type (house or apartment), whether the household owns the dwelling, age of the dwelling, and the size of the living area.",
    "However, evidence from other countries in the region suggests electricity tariff reforms can have a significant impact on household fuel choice.",
    "In this note we analyze the impact of higher electricity tariffs on household welfare, the distributional and fiscal impact of alternative electricity tariff structures, and the potential impact of higher electricity tariffs on household choice of space heating fuel.",
    "Unfortunately, data on Montenegrin household electricity consumption at different electricity price levels are not available in the ISSP 2004 survey or from previous household surveys.",
    "In this paper we refer to both types of transfer, whether from the government or from other consumers, as a subsidy.",
    "21 We estimate a multinomial logit model to investigate what factors determine household choice of a heating fuel.",
    "We find that the inclusion of household per capita expenditures does not significantly affect any of the other explanatory variables coefficients, and report the results including per capita expenditures as one of the explanatory variables (as do most other energy studies).",
    "The importance of income/expenditures in household fuel choice is well documented.",
    "15 For an in-depth discussion of the ways to design a successful means-tested direct income transfers program see Coady, Grosh and Hoddinot (2004) .",
    "Larger household size, which could indicate the availability of free household labor to chop and transport fuelwood, and ownership of a wood plot, may make fuelwood an even cheaper alternative heating fuel.",
    "The proportional impact on the poorest households is largest, and thus we still observe the proportion of households using electricity for heating increasing across income groups and the proportion of households using fuelwood decreasing across income groups.",
    "21 The model used here follows Rasmus Heltberg's analysis in Fuel Switching: Evidence from Eight Developing Countries.",
    "Clearly, all households are subsidy recipients in Scenario 1 when everybody is charged a tariff below the cost-recovery level (Table 7) .",
    "In Scenario 2 the subsidy is only for the first 300 kWh, and it is the same for all income groups since on average all households consume more than 300 kWh per month.",
    "As shown in Figure 4 , they are in the range of 2 to 4 Euros for households in the bottom three deciles, while high income households pay a higher average tariff than the costrecovery level on their total electricity consumption (Appendix Table 2 ).",
    "A systematic review of electricity consumption subsidies in 22 countries reached a conclusion that an IBT, the most common tariff approach to providing subsidies, tends to have high coverage of the poor 14 According to EPCG, if old debts are excluded, the collection ratio varied between 62.4 and 89.4 percent between 1999 and 2004, and in 2004 it varied between 69 and 100 percent by region.",

    "In this scenario it is interesting to compare the current budget share spent on electricity and the welfare losses expressed as percentage of total household expenditures."
