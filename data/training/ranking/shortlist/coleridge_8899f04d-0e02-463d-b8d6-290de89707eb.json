    "ISSN: 1463-4988 print / 1539-4077 online DOI: 10.1080/14634988.2011.628242 (Peckham et al., 2006).",
    "For this effort, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Landsat Multi-spectral Scanner (MSS) data (1-km and 200-m resolution, respectively) were used.",
    "Although data from an ongoing national program, the USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) set, covered the entire area of interest (the U.S. side of the Great Lakes basin), for the two time steps of interest, due to shifts in the processing protocol, considerable work, and additional datasets were needed to make these two time steps comparable.",
    "For this analysis we worked with the best available datasets and don't intend this analysis to be the definitive enumeration of land cover change in the Lake Superior basin.",
    "We then summarized and compared these land cover types for each time period across a common set of watersheds derived from elevation data (Hollenhorst et al., 2007) for the entire Lake Superior basin.",
    "(2006), and 1992 and 2000 Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Provincial Land Cover data (PLO) acquired through the Ontario Geospatial Data Exchange (OGDE), we developed a common land cover classification, cross-walking land cover classes found in each dataset.",
    "Such data are instrumental in informing planning and policy analyses, helping to focus intensive monitoring efforts, helping to prioritize restoration and mitigation efforts, and furthering our understanding of landscape -water quality relationships (Morrice et al., 2008).",
    "Using the reprocessed 1992 and 2001 U.S. NLCD land cover data from Wolter et al.",
    "Concurrently, the Science and Information Branch, Land Information Ontario, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, has developed satellite derived land cover data for similar dates (1992 and 2000 respectively), but only for areas on the Canadian Shield for the later date (Spectranalysis Inc., unpublished data).",
    "This was accomplished using ArcGIS version 10 geographic information system software (ESRI, 2010) by aggregating specific land cover classes to a less specific common class (i.e.",
    "We were able to document changes across the entire Lake Superior basin for the decade between the early 1990s and early 2000 using exist-ing land cover data from the U.S. and Canada.",
    "Also, marked effects of forest fragmentation on bird communities have been well documented (Andren, 1994;Hagan et al., 1996), yet we still have few tools or programs to effectively measure changes in habitat fragmentation over time or changes in forest age and structure over large extents (Jaeger, 2000;Jaeger et al., 2008;Riiters et al., 2004;Wickham et al., 2007).",
    "Hopefully future data products will include compatible satellite derived circa 2000 land cover maps for the southern Ontario portion of the basin, and new updated 2006 land cover map for the entire Canadian portion of the Great Lakes Basin to match existing maps covering the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes.",
    "Conversely, the Canadian land cover classification had seven forest classes and ten wetland classes compared to only three forest classes and seven wetland classes in the U.S. Finding common classes across data sets required reducing these to just three common wetland classes and three forest classes.",
    "This allowed us to identify and quantify the relative amount and types of change occurring generally across the entire basin, more specifically across both the U.S. and Canadian portions of the basin, and more explicitly for near coastal areas and watersheds across the entire basin.",
    "The objectives of this study were to develop a land use change map for the Lake Superior basin, using existing data products, to highlight the need for consistent land cover maps and to assess the potential for detecting the various types of land cover change using existing maps.",
    "The first bi-national land cover classification was developed for a single time step (1985)(1986)(1987) by the Canadian Forest Service to model breeding bird distribution in the Great Lakes basin (Venier et al., 2004).",
    "Sources of error include errors (which are not yet well documented) associated with each land cover classification, registration errors and the ambiguity associated with each land cover class definition and temporal differences in the imagery used for the classification.",
    "This results in a significant loss of information, especially in light of work by Wolter et al.",
    "This resulted in the identification of 17 common land cover classes representing open lands, agricultural lands, forest lands, and developed areas (Table 1).",
    "It is beyond the scope of this effort to comprehensively assess mechanisms for this change, but it was visually evident, using Google Earth and Bing Maps imagery, that timber harvesting has occurred proximate to areas with the greatest amount of coniferous forest change.",
    "Although this effort was complicated by differences in classification schemes (and slightly different dates), we were able to develop a common set of land cover classes both across the basin and across the time steps available.",
    "The development of a useful common classification that accommodated differences in detail across the four different land cover classifications (Table 1) required us to significantly simplify each classification.",
    "In view of this, consistent, repeatable, and broadly applicable land use, land cover data are needed across the Lake Superior basin to facilitate ecosystem condition assessment and trend analysis.",
    "to document and quantify U.S. Great Lakes change including detection of a significant increase in low intensity development, with over 38% of that change occurring within 10 km of the Great Lakes coastline.",
    "Using this common land cover classification (classes are briefly described in Table 2), we compared the explicit amount and relative amount (total hectares and proportion of each area as percents) for each of the common land cover classes that occurred across the two time steps for the entire Lake Superior basin, for the U.S. portion of the Lake Superior basin only, and for the Canadian portion of the Lake Superior basin only.",
    "In 2011, USGS updated NLCD 2006 designed for land change analysis, released.",
    "(2006) who were able to document a significant increase in low intensity development (likely residential) within 10 km of the Great Lakes coastline.",
    "The most comprehensive analysis of land cover change in the Great Lakes basin (Wolter et al., 2006), which included the Lake Superior basin, was conducted only for the U.S. portion of the basin and required significant effort to develop comparable land cover maps for 1992 and 2001.",
    "Rather, we hope to highlight the need for, and provide a first step towards a consistent and repeatable bi-national land cover change analysis and eventual trend analysis for the Lake Superior basin.",
    "The explicit amount (expressed in hectares) and the relative amount (expressed in percent of the total area) was calculated for each common land cover class, for each time step and geographic zone.",
    "In summary, we recommend a bi-nationally consistent classification of land cover collected at regular intervals (i.e.",
    "Land cover changes in the Canadian portion of the basin (Table 4) largely paralleled those of the entire basin.",
    "The effectiveness and potential uses of this effort would be maximized by maintaining the highest possible level of resolution within the land cover classification scheme so that significant types of land cover change can be detected (e.g.",
    "In fact, documenting and understanding such subtle changes in land cover, including forest age, structure, and fragmentation as well as changes within particular land cover classes, will likely be as important as more obvious types of land cover change.",
    "This is compounded by the basin's relatively low population, and lack of academic and government institutions available to undertake baseline and monitoring efforts necessary to fully understand and quantify the health and condition of the world's largest freshwater basin.",
    "Consequently, the amount of young forest (<16 years) has been combined with the area of open land as part of standard hydrologic assessments within Wisconsin Great Lakes watersheds (WI Lake Superior Basin Partner Team 2007).",
    "Nevertheless, this work permitted Wolter et al.",
    "Although these classifications were useful for modeling breeding bird distribution, multiple time steps were not available to permit assessment of land use change.",
    "A standardized, bi-national classification of land cover, updated at regular intervals (i.e.",
    "This is changing as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in conjunction with the USGS NLCD effort, has begun work developing consistent bi-national land cover change maps for the Great Lakes as part of their Coastal Change Analysis Program (N. Harold, NOAA, Charleston, SC, pers.",
    "It might also be partially due to the coarse classification resolution for developed lands within the cross-walked classification scheme, with only one land cover class representing the many different types of developed land, and therefore no possibility of assessing intensification of land use (i.e.",
    "Thus, data for the year 2000 are available for the entire Lake Superior basin but not for Canadian portions of Lake Ontario or Lake Erie.",
    "every 5 years) has been identified as an important component for assessing the state of Lake Superior and would also provide an international perspective of anthropogenic drivers likely to affect the health of various ecosystems across the Great Lakes basin, including Lake Superior (State of the Great Lakes, 2009).",
    "The greatest change was a 4.9% difference (610,811 ha) in area of mixed forest and a corresponding decrease (3.9%; 493,560 ha) in the proportion of coniferous forest types (Table 3) representing a nearly 17% change (increase) in mixed forest and a 22% change (decrease) in coniferous forest types.",
    "aggregating the four development classes available in the Wolter et al.",
    "This is the first high resolution land cover change product ever produced for the nation at a 30 meter spatial resolution.",
    "Most notably, we detected a general loss of coniferous forest cover types in the basin, and a trend towards a mixed forest type.",
    "Such an approach helps contrast the relative amount and types of change expected to vary widely across international borders, proximity to the coast, and explicitly by watersheds in the basin.",
    "Detecting landscape change is a complex endeavor, confused by changing data sources, varying data resolution and differential spatial extents, and finally, land cover classifications."
