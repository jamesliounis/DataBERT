    "We used the DEA's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) data to obtain the number of grams of buprenorphine dispensed in each state for each year from 2004 to 2011.",
    "Therefore, we used data on buprenorphine provision in substance abuse treatment facilities from the 2004-2006 and 2008-2011 N-SSATS to impute substance abuse treatment facilities' use of buprenorphine in 2007.",
    "To verify the robustness of our analytic approach, we estimated several different alternative models, including models with and without normalization for state population size, weighted and unweighted by the state's population size, and GEE models with various assumptions about the correlation structures or the error terms.",
    "Our findings must be considered in the context of our study's limitations.",
    "As Table 2 shows, the mean number of 30-patientwaivered physicians per capita is much higher than the number of 100patient-waivered physicians per capita, buprenorphine-providing opioid treatment programs per capita, and buprenorphine-providing substance abuse treatment facilities per capita.",
    "Methods: Using 2004-2011 state-level data on buprenorphine dispensed and county-level data on the number of buprenorphine-waivered physicians and substance abuse treatment facilities using buprenorphine, we estimated a multivariate ordinary least squares regression model with state fixed effects of a state's annual total buprenorphine dispensed per capita as a function of the state's number of buprenorphine providers.",
    "The number of urban 30-patientwaivered physicians per capita was significantly associated with more buprenorphine being dispensed in 2006 (p < 0.01) and with modest reductions in buprenorphine per capita dispensed in 2009-2011 (p < 0.05 in each year) ( Table 3).",
    "We estimated weighted least squares with state-level population weights to account for possible differences in the variance of the error terms (heteroskedasticity) across states that might be caused by state-level population size.",
    "We normalized the data by 10,000 state residents to account for the fact that the population totals by state differed substantially.",
    "18,21 Under DATA2000, physicians (hereafter referred to as \"waivered physicians\") who completed an approved course or who had a board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry were waivered from the special registration requirements in the Controlled Substances Act.",
    "We first calculated the number of urban and rural 100-patient-waivered physicians, 30-patient-waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, and substance abuse treatment facilities in each state and year from 2004 through 2011 and matched this to information regarding the total grams of buprenorphine dispensed in each state and year.",
    "In a multivariate regression examining the amount of buprenorphine dispensed (in grams per capita per year), we found that 100patient-waivered physicians had a greater positive impact than did 30patient-waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, or substance abuse treatment facilities.",
    "Accordingly, we specified the model with interactions of provider type by urban-rural status.",
    "We sought to translate grams of buprenorphine into the potential number of individuals treated with buprenorphine in a year to provide a greater clinical context for our analysis and findings, as we are aware that because of the tremendous variation in how buprenorphine is used, the calculation would be, at best, a rough guide.",
    "Rural 100-patient-waivered physicians were also significantly associated (p < 0.05, 2008-2011) with higher amounts of buprenorphine per capita being dispensed within a state.",
    "We therefore examined the impact of the 2006 legislation-as well as the association between urban and rural waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, and substance abuse treatment facilities-on buprenorphine distributed per capita over the past decade.",
    "Over that period, there was a slightly greater percentage increase in the number of waivered physicians in rural counties compared with those in urban counties, with 27.1 waivered physicians in urban counties for each waivered physician in a rural county  In contrast to waivered physicians, however, the increase in the number of opioid treatment programs and substance abuse treatment facilities providing buprenorphine was greater in urban than in rural counties.",
    "Using the state-year as the unit of analysis, we specified a multivariate weighted ordinary least squares regression model of a state's annual total buprenorphine dispensed per 10,000 state residents (hereafter referred to as \"per capita\") as a function of the state's number of buprenorphine providers per capita, by type of provider (100-patient-waivered physicians, 30-patient-waivered physicians, opioid treatment programs, and substance abuse treatment facilities) per capita.",
    "The number of rural 30-patient-waivered physicians per capita was significantly associated with more buprenorphine per capita dispensed in 2006, 2009, and   Table 3).",
    "Because buprenorphine was approved in 2002 and its use grew substantially thereafter, we allowed for time trends by admitting a set of time indicator main effects as well as time indicator interactions with each provider-type variable.",
    "The RAND Institutional Review Board approved the study.",
    "We consulted the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes 41 (RUCC) from the Area Resource File (ARF) to categorize the urbanization of all counties containing a buprenorphine provider (waivered physician, opioid treatment programs, or substance abuse treatment facilities).",
    "By exploiting the variation in the number of buprenorphine providers over time and within states, we used the model to estimate the amount of buprenorphine that each provider type contributed to the total.",
    "24,34,55 We can speculate that the greater amounts of dispensed buprenorphine are likely associated with the treatment of more individuals for longer periods and that those physicians who have sought a waiver to treat up to 100 patients are likely treating more individuals than are physicians waivered to treat 30 patients.",
    "The total number of waivered physicians (Table 1) also went up dramatically, from 3,293 waivered physicians in 2004 to 20,410 waivered physicians in 2011.",
    "For the years following the 2006 legislation, we found that 100patient-waivered physicians were significantly associated with greater amounts of buprenorphine per capita dispensed.",
    "We found the number of waivered physicians in each state, and whether they were waivered to treat up to 30 or 100 patients, from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Buprenorphine Waiver Notification System, which contains information about all buprenorphine-waivered physicians.",
    "Despite these limitations, our findings offer important information about the dispensation of buprenorphine in recent years, clearly demonstrating that the amount of buprenorphine being dispensed has grown more rapidly than the number of buprenorphine providers in recent years, as well as showing substantial differences among different types of providers in the amount of buprenorphine per capita dispensed.",
    "[49][50][51][52] More research is needed to better understand the relationship between greater access to buprenorphine, greater engagement in appropriate opioid agonist treatment, and a higher number of negative consequences associated with the more widespread availability of buprenorphine.",
    "We used the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), an annual survey of all substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States, to identify methadone-dispensing opioid treatment programs and non-methadone-dispensing substance abuse treatment facilities in each state treating patients with buprenorphine.",
    "Given recent findings that suggest substantial rural-urban differences in the distribution of waivered physicians 40 and opioid agonist treatment patterns, 33 we hypothesized that the amount of buprenorphine dispensed by providers in urban and rural counties would be significantly different.",
    "64 Some combination of these factors, and the likelihood that many of the most active buprenorphine-prescribing physicians sought approval to treat 100 patients, may help explain our finding a statistically significant negative association in 2009-2011 between the number of urban 30-patient-waivered physicians and the amount of buprenorphine dispensed.",
    "16 Most individuals who might benefit from these medications, however, do not receive them, 17,18 which is the reason for the recent efforts to expand their use.",
    "Dr. Gordon receives royalties from Cambridge University Press and UptoDate for work unrelated to this topic.",
    "39 We are unaware, however, of studies examining the relative impact of waivered physicians vis-\u00e0-vis treatment facilities regarding the overall amount of buprenorphine being dispensed across treatment systems and payers, or to what extent the distribution of buprenorphine to patients may be influenced by the number of patients a physician is allowed to treat at one time with buprenorphine.",
    "Since the 2006 legislation first allowing 100patient-waivered physicians, urban 100-patient-waivered physicians per capita have been significantly (p < 0.001, 2007-2011, inclusive) associated with greater amounts of buprenorphine per capita dispensed, with each additional urban 100-patient-waivered physician per capita associated with an additional 211 grams of buprenorphine dispensed per capita in 2007, rising to an additional 400 grams of buprenorphine dispensed per capita in 2011 (Table 3).",
    "In this article, we examine the influence of the 2006 legislation between 2004 and 2011, specifically the relationship between the amount of buprenorphine that each state dispenses annually per capita and the number of physicians waivered to treat up to 100 patients at a time with buprenorphine, the number of physicians waivered to treat up to 30 patients at a time with buprenorphine, the number of methadone-dispensing opioid treatment programs treating individuals receiving buprenorphine, and the number of non-methadonedispensing substance abuse treatment facilities treating individuals receiving buprenorphine (all these are per capita).",
    "But further research is needed to better understand the number of individuals that each type of buprenorphine provider is actually treating, as well as the nature and quality of that treatment.",
    "By 2011, the number of opioid treatment programs in urban counties providing buprenorphine had risen to 11.4 for each opioid treatment program in a rural county, and the number of substance abuse treatment facilities in urban counties providing buprenorphine had risen to 9.5 for each substance abuse treatment facility in a rural county.",
    "54 In contrast, despite the substantial increase in the number of 30patient-waivered physicians in both urban and rural areas, our findings regarding the relationship between 30-patient-waivered physicians and the amount of buprenorphine dispensed in recent years suggest that many of the physicians waivered to treat 30 patients may actually be treating few or no patients with buprenorphine, which is consistent with earlier research findings.",
    "12,23 Since buprenorphine's approval, its availability from an increasing number of waivered physicians and substance abuse treatment facilities 21,[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] has raised the number of individuals receiving buprenorphine 19,[33][34][35][36][37][38] and often for the longer durations associated with improved outcomes.",
    "The amount of buprenorphine dispensed and the number of buprenorphine providers of all types rose substantially between 2004 and 2011, consistent with a range of studies finding an increase in buprenorphine-waivered providers, substance abuse treatment facilities using buprenorphine, and patients receiving buprenorphine.",
    "Most important, even though we documented substantial growth in the number of all types of buprenorphine providers and the grams of buprenorphine dispensed, we were unable to assess the clinical impact of more providers or more grams of buprenorphine dispensed.",
    "To enhance policymakers' and payers' ability to more effectively and efficiently increase office-based physicians' appropriate use of buprenorphine, we need more research to better understand the complex influences on waivered physicians' decisions regarding the number of patients to treat with buprenorphine, as well as the factors that help physicians do so safely and effectively.",
    "Therefore, despite the overall increase in the number of buprenorphine providers, there were relatively few rural providers in 2011, with a total of 118 buprenorphine-providing substance abuse treatment facilities, 28 buprenorphine-providing opioid treatment programs, and 852 waivered physicians in the nation's 1,231 rural counties.",
    "66,67 For that reason, our estimate of the number of additional patients represented by the greater number of grams of buprenorphine dispensed is probably quite conservative.",
    "19,25 Our findings, however, suggest that the greatest impact on the amount of buprenorphine being dispensed came from waivered physicians able to treat up to 100 patients with buprenorphine.",
    "I n the United States, opioid use disorders are a significant public health problem, estimated to affect more than 2 million individuals.",
    "The relationship between 30-patient-waivered physicians and buprenorphine per capita dispensed was substantially different from that observed for the 100-patient-waivered physicians, suggesting that 30-patient-waivered physicians are not as important as contributors to the growth in the distribution of buprenorphine.",
    "The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA2000) allowed Schedule III-V medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as buprenorphine opioid agonists available as buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone formulations (hereafter referred to as \"buprenorphine\") to be prescribed for the treatment of opioid dependence, a move that was welcomed as an opportunity to increase access to opioid agonist therapy."
