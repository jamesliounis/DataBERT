    "To address these issues, the paper relies on the instrumental variable spatial autoregressive model (Drukker et al.",
    "As shown at the bottom of Table 4 , the spatial autocorrelation is found to be significant.",
    "Section III discusses our empirical methodology and data.",
    "The chi-square test statistics are estimated at 9.86, 2.68 and 4.44 for the column (1), (2) and (3) models.",
    "From the methodological point of view, the paper found the importance of dealing with infrastructure endogeneity in the empirical model.",
    "This is referred to as economies of agglomeration, and the literature is generally supportive of this (e.g., Procher, 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Mare and Graham, 2013) .",
    "As discussed above, the spatial autocorrelation is significant in our data; therefore, the ordinary least squares estimator is not likely to be unbiased in any case.",
    "From the methodological point of view, the paper also addresses several important empirical issues, such as endogeneity of infrastructure placement.",
    "Other explanatory variables included in X are summarized in Table 3 .",
    "Given the above results, one of the important empirical questions is whether spatial autocorrelation really matters to the firm location choice.",
    "Using the recent firm registry database in Tanzania, particular attention was paid to the effects of infrastructure conditions, such as transport connectivity.",
    "Therefore, the infrastructure variables are likely to be endogenous in our data.",
    "To deal with the possible endogeneity of infrastructure variables in X, the spatial instrumental variable estimator (e.g., Anselin, 1988; Drukker st al., 2011)",
    "Instrumental variable spatial autoregressive estimation is performed; the results are shown in Table 4 .",

    "The current paper aims at examining the firm location behavior in Tanzania, which is a country with a land area of more than 900,000 km 2 .",
    "To deal with the potential endogeneity caused by infrastructure placement as well as spatial autocorrelation among neighboring locations, the instrumental variable spatial autoregressive model was applied.",
    "The second instrument follows the recent literature focused on the evaluation of infrastructure investment.",
    "The recent literature focuses on the impact of local taxation on firms' locational choice of investment (e.g., Brulhart, Jametti and Schmidheiny, 2012; Mare and Graham, 2013) .",
    "The second approach, which the current paper relies on, is to allow correlated errors in \u03bej and eliminate the IIA assumption.",

    "Particularly, the literature suggests that transport connectivity is crucial to the locational choices of firms.",

    "As the result, infrastructure variables are likely endogenous in the equation.",
    "The coefficient is significant at -0.37.",
    "The first approach is the nested logit model, which can partly relax the IIA assumption across different clusters.",
    "where \u03bb is a spatial autoregressive dependence in district share s. \u03c1 represents possible autocorrelation in error term \u03be. W and M are spatial weighting matrices.",
    "The estimated coefficients turned out to be broadly similar to the above (Table 5 ).",
    "To examine the firm's locational choice in connection to site-specific characteristics, we start with the standard conditional logit framework (McFadden, 1974) .",
    "Three measurements are considered in this paper: (i) local connectivity, (ii) accessibility to the domestic market, and (iii) accessibility to the global market.",

    "The results indicate significant agglomeration economies.",
    "Among transport variables, the global market connectivity, namely, transport costs to the port, turned out most important, followed by local connectivity measured by road density.",
    "In Tanzania, there are about 45,000 enterprises that are formally registered according to the Central Register of Establishments data in 2010.",
    "Section IV presents main estimation results, and Section V discusses some policy implications.",
    "The spatial autoregressive term \u03bb is estimated at 0.3 to 0.4.",
    "5 The results are broadly consistent with Table   4 .",
    "The firm location literature particularly focuses on accessibility to fundamental transport infrastructure, such as highway and ports (e.g., Boudier-Bensebaa, 2005; Cie\u015blik and Ryan, 2004; Milner et al., 2006; Belderbos and Carree, 2002; Deichmann et al., 2005) .",
    "Second, the power cost may not have much variation in the spatial dimension, regardless of the differences observed in our variable.",
    "The new economic geography literature suggests that agglomeration economies are a key factor in increasing firm productivity (Krugman, 1991; Fujita et al.",
    "The elasticity is estimated at 0.14, which is broadly consistent with the existing literature (e.g., 0.18 for French firms in Europe (Procher, 2011) ; 0.37 for Korean manufactures in the U.S. (Lee et al., 2012) ; 0.05 for firms in New Zealand (Mare and Graham, 2013) ).",
