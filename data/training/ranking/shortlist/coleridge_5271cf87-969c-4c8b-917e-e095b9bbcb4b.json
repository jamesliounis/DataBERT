  "shortlist": [
    "Herein, we have reported on the characteristic epidemiology of mcGTCs by using available population-level data.",
    "All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS University Edition software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).",
    "The literature includes single-institution studies.",
    "*Residency demographic and body site were included because of their significance on univariate analysis.",
    "Data on patients with a diagnosis of mcGTC were obtained from the SEER program for the years 1973 to 2013.",
    "We used data from the population-based US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to analyze patient and disease characteristics of patients with mcGTCs and to determine factors affecting both overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) after diagnosis.",
    "There is a potential for absent or incorrect reporting in retrospective data, variations in coding practices over time, migration of patients in and out of SEER registry areas, and varied reports on the representativeness of the database itself (ie, not all hospitals participate, and those that do are more likely to be large academic centers [42] [43] [44] ).",
    "11, 18, 19 However, the understanding of patient characteristics and treatment modalities is lacking owing to limited data.",
    "10, 11 Although the literature includes a number of case series and reports about granular cell tumors as a whole, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] population-level data on malignant cutaneous lesions are limited.",
    "Threshold for significance was based on a 2-sided P value of .05 or less.",
    "The OS and DSS curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were formally tested for univariate analyses using log-rank tests.",
    "However, the multivariable analyses revealed that surgical management of disease improves DSS by 5.34 years (3.39-28.52).",
    "This report adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.",
    "An analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated demographic, race, and sex-based disparities that have not yet been reported in the literature.",
    "These data underlie the importance of early diagnosis and surgical treatment of mcGTCs for optimal outcomes and outline characteristics that may be used to inform future guidelines to identify and manage high-risk patients.",
    "Despite these limitations, the use of SEER data to consider determinants of rare cutaneous malignancies has been validated in the literature.",
    "The geographic and socioeconomic diversity of the SEER registries make our findings likely to be generalizable across care settings and patient populations in the United States.",
    "A risk-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent relationship of reported disease and patient characteristics with OS and DSS.",
    "Year of diagnosis, continuous age at diagnosis, sex, race, residency demographic, tumor extent and size, body site, treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, and OS and DSS in months were extracted from the database for analysis.",
    "The divisions introduced (ie, local, regional, and distant) are consistent with SEER classifications and, perhaps most importantly, are correlated with DSS in both univariate and multivariable models.",
    "22 As data quality made it impossible to distinguish between stage II and stage III lesions, the SEER staging criteria groupings were applied as follows: (1) Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.",
    "Our findings support the previously reported high mortality associated with mcGTCs, 11, 18 with a 5-year DSS of 62.8%.",
    "The SEER database search yielded 113 patients with granular cell tumors from 1973 to 2013, of which 82 patients (72.6%) presented with tumors on the cutis or subcutis.",
    "This study also reveals a number of prognostic factors, of which the most important is J AM ACAD DERMATOL VOLUME 78, NUMBER 3 thought to be cancer staging.",
    "The database is a widely used cancer registry that covers an estimated 27.8% of the US population.",
    "The median OS and DSS were 11.6 years and 20.1 years, respectively (Fig 1) .",
    "Patient fields with missing data were recoded as empty cells to avoid inaccurate regressions on ordinal variables.",
    "There are limitations in this study design.",
    "Advanced age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P\\.01), male sex (95% CI, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82; P = .02), advanced cancer stage (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.40-3.72; P\\.01), and receipt of surgical resection (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.59; P = .02) independently predicted DSS (Table IV) .",
    "Significant univariate variables were included as covariates along with age, sex, and year.",
    "It is important to note that the finding that lack of radiation therapy is associated with improved riskadjusted OS is likely to be due to an underlying clinically derived selection bias among patients who undergo radiation.",
    "Though there is a risk of misattribution, this is largely mitigated by the coding scheme for this variable which accounts for tumor sequence, site of original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities.",
    "Residency demographics were defined by using US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum codes.",
    "Survival analysis from Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the 5-year OS and DSS rates for mcGTCs were 63.3% and 62.8%, respectively.",
    "Sex differences in DSS in adjusted models were statistically significant, with females suffering worse outcomes; comparatively, their male counterparts lived 1.39 years longer with adjustment for all other covariates for DSS.",
    "Clinically, this finding is important in counseling patients on future risks and has implications for postdiagnosis screening and monitoring.",
    "33, [45] [46] [47] Given the rare nature of the tumor, limited sample size means that significant results are likely to be even more pronounced.",
    "CI, Confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.",
    "To quantify the degree of survival difference, risk-adjusted 50th percentile (median) quantile regression for DSS was used.",
    "20 The 9-level scale codes gradations of metropolitan areas (ie, population $20,000) (codes 1-3) and nonmetropolitan areas (ie, population \\20,000) (4-9 or Alaska and Hawaii), 21 thus allowing for the extraction of a dichotomous metro versus nonmetro variable.",
    "[39] [40] [41] Category in parentheses defines the strata the hazard ratio represents.",
    "Analyses in SEER*Stat of the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio also revealed an increased risk for subsequent pancreatic or renal cancers among these patients.",
    "The SEER cause-specific death classification field was used for DSS, a variable that uses algorithms to process a single, disease-specific underlying cause of death from death certificates.",
    "Statistically significant increased risk of secondary malignancies was determined by using the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio function in SEER*Stat.",
    "Inclusion in the risk-adjusted model resulted in insufficient power to make the individual categorical HRs meaningful.",
    "Patients in whom mcGTC has been diagnosed are at an increased risk (P\\.05) for subsequent diagnosis of either renal (93.03 per 10,000 person-years [PYs]) or pancreatic cancer (89.56 per 10,000 PYs) from 60 to 119 months thereafter compared with the general population.",
    "The profound differences in median DSS time in yearsdfrom 21.5 and 3.6 for local and regional tumors, respectively, to 0.4 for distant tumorsdis striking and clinically applicable.",
    "On risk-adjusted multivariable analysis, advanced age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P\\.01), advanced stage (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.23-3.53; P\\.01), and lack of radiation therapy (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.79; P = .02) were found to be independent predictors of OS.",
    "17 Clinical presentation and histopathologic analysis of malignant cases has been well profiled for small sample sizes.",
    "Of the selected cohort, 65.0% were female and 70.8% were white."
