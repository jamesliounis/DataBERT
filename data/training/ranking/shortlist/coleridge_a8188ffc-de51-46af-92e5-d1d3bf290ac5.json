  "shortlist": [
    "This selection results in a dataset composed by 59, 142 and 84 subjects for AD, MCI and CN, respectively.",
    "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.",
    "ENB/114606/2009 and PTDC/EEI-SII/2312/2012.",
    "In this study, we used FDG-PET images for AD, MCI and CN subjects, retrieved from the ADNI database.",
    "The two parameters we are discussing affects not only the number of features of the space, but also the Figure 5 compares the best result obtained with the proposed methodology for each problem with the methodology using the voxel intensity.",
    "This paper is organized as follows: section 2 explains each step of the proposed methodology and section 3 presents the dataset used in this paper as well the results obtained for the proposed methodology and for the classification task using the voxel intensity.",
    "Table 1 summarizes some clinical and demographic information in each group.",
    "In our methodology, the local density is computed as\nwhere \u2299 is the element-wise product of two equally sized data cubes, K w is a cubic Gaussian kernel with standard deviation equal to ws/(4 2 log(2)), I w v i jk is the sub-window from the intensity image, and a k is the number of non-zero values in K w .",
    "The first part of our experiments consists in the analysis of the influence of these parameters in the results.",
    "This is due to the choice of the clustering algorithm, which is a variant of the DB-SCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) called XMT-DBSCAN (Tran et al., 2012) .",
    "Finally, feature selection is applied and the subjects are classified, using support vector machines.",
    "After segmenting each 3-D image, we obtain a partition into regions (clusters) and we need to find some consensual information for each population (AD, CN or MCI).",
    "In section 2, we state that XMT-DBSCAN has two parameters: window size w and \u03d5 which is a threshold to identify core and border voxels (see (Ester et al., 1996) for more details).",
    "In the case of AD vs MCI, the worst results are for w = 3 and \u03d5 = 0.3 and it is approximately 64%, but the best result is obtained using only 50 features and a small window and density in the XMT-DBSCAN algorithm (w = 2 and \u03d5 = 0.3).",
    "In this paper, we propose a methodology to au-tomatically extract features that represent interesting regions of the brain and, consequently, reducing the dimensionality of the space.",
    "Some other dimensionality reduction techniques from Machine Learning field Segovia et al., 2012) , and feature selection techniques (Bicacro et al., 2012; Chaves et al., 2009 ) have been applied to the diagnosis of AD.",
    "Most of the techniques developed have focused on analyzing small parts of the brain like hippocampus (Gerardin et al., 2009) or the gray matter volume (Fan et al., 2008) .",
    "After selecting the most relevant features for each of the three diagnostic problems, we classify subjects through the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a linear kernel (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) .",
    "The number of selected features used to classify the subjects are shown in table 2.",
    "Another modification to the original DB-SCAN is in the definition of density-reachable chain (Ester et al., 1996) , which is modified to contain only core voxels.",
    "The proposed methodology has several stages: starts with a segmentation of the FDG-PET image, followed by a grouping of clusters to form regions with relevant information.",
    "This means that we will construct a feature space for each of these problems using the voxels intensities from two populations and the regions found in step 2 corresponding to the same two populations.",
    "The idea is to perform a pairwise comparison between the partitions obtained by XMT-DBSCAN for each subject of a population.",
    "Then, voxel intensities from each ROI are used as features (Zhang et al., 2011; Mikhno et al., 2012) .",
    "Now the best result is higher than 76% and it is given by w = 2 and \u03d5 = 0.5, which means that we need a small sub-window to distinguish between MCI subjects and CN subjects.",
    "We consider several number of features selected by the MI, according to table 2.",
    "Figure 2 shows an example of a coherence matrix.",
    "In the feature selection step we discretized the probability density functions through histograms with 8 bins and, after ranking the features according to the MI, we choose the ones with higher value.",
    "This may indicate that we need more features to discriminate MCI subjects from AD subjects, which means we need to decrease the size of the regions corresponding to a decreasing in the parameters w and/or \u03d5.",
    "We start by searching the most coherent cluster in matrix C and obtain a region R corresponding to the union of all clusters with an overlapping over 50% to the most coherent cluster found.",
    "Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the one using voxel intensities despite only a small number of features is needed to achieve that result.",
    "Moreover, attempts are being made to develop tools to automatically analyze the images and, consequently, diagnosis AD and MCI conditions (Morgado et al., 2013; Ram\u00edrez et al., 2013) .",
    "This paper thus proposes a methodology to identify regions of interest by segmenting 3-D FDG-PET scans and extracting features that represent each of those regions of interest, reducing the dimensionality of the space.",
    "The identification of the voxels as core points, border points and noise is similar to the original DBSCAN.",
    "The MI between the random variable x i and y is given by\nThe probability density functions for MI were estimated through the use of histograms.",
    "In AD vs CN problem we see that the best result is higher than 89% and it is given when we consider a \u03d5 = 0.7 and w = 3 in the XMT-DBSCAN algorithm.",
    "Finally a classifier is used to identify the subjects.",
    "So, it is very important to reduce the dimensionality of the space through feature selection.",
    "Since we want a region that is common in most of the subjects, we consider that values under 50% of overlapping are discarded.",
    "In order to analyze the FDG-PET scans for each task: AD versus CN (Cognitive Normal), MCI versus CN and AD versus MCI, we propose the methodology shown in Figure 1 .",
    "Then, we perform a feature extraction step using the voxel intensities and the probability matrix, obtaining a feature space representation for each problem.",
    "We want to construct a feature space F with M A + M B samples and dimension K A + K B , in the following way\nwith r, s \u2208 {population A, population B}.",
    "A more detailed description of the pre-processing is available in the ADNI project webpage 1 .",
    "I(v i jk \u2208 S r p ) is the intensity of voxel v i jk from subject p in population r and P s (v i jk , R q ) is the probability that voxel v i jk belongs to region R q in population s. \u03b1(p, r) and \u03b2(q, s) are indexation functions given by\nrespectively.",
    "Therefore, researchers are focusing their techniques in analyzing the pattern of the entire brain.",
    "Those regions form a feature space and the most important ones are selected by ranking their mutual information with the target output.",
    "Moreover, with w = 2 and \u03d5 = 0.3 we have the lowest accuracy for different number of features and the maximum is when we have a space with 1000 features with an accuracy of approximately 87%.",
    "The subjects were chosen to obey a certain criteria: the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) should be 0.5 or higher for AD patients, 0.5 for MCI patients and 0 for normal controls.",
    "The FDG-PET images have been pre-processed to minimize differences between images: each image was co-registered, averaged, reoriented (the anteriorposterior axis of each subject was parallel to the AC-PC line), normalized in its intensity, and smoothed",
    "We start by segmenting each 3-D image (a FDG-PET scan from a subject), followed by a construction of a probability matrix indicating the degree of belonging of each voxel to a region found by the clustering/segmentation algorithm."
