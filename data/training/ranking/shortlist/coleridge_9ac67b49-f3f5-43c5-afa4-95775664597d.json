  "shortlist": [
    "All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 12.0.",
    "In addition, the overall data analysis was carried out by IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli.",
    "Sociodemographic and clinical features, neuropsychological performances, and ICVs were compared among clinical groups with the ANOVA for continuous variables (post-hoc analysis were done using Bonferroni correction), and with the \u03c7 2 test for dichotomous variables.",
    "Then, the above parameters have been compared with ranked-A ADNI reference scans in order to define the goodness of the I-ADNI site acquisition.",
    "Furthermore, considering exclusively I-ADNI scanners, post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant higher ICV for the UO6 (p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction) compared to that obtained from all other I-ADNI units, with the 1.5T.",
    "The Coordinating Center was responsible for clinical and MRI data including: case report form development, implementation of clinical and neuropsychological database, implementation of ADNI platform for structural MRI, MR sequences storage, MRI quality control.",
    "Table 2 reports the technical features of each scanner and the number of MPRAGE sequences acquired in each OU.",
    "Ideally, in order to minimize error variance, an ADNI like multi-site reproducibility using a large sample of volunteers scanned repeatedly at all sites and within a short period of time, should be used.",
    "The inter-rater reliability versus the reference standard tracing ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 at 3T, and from 0.82 to 0.97 at 1.5T scanners (Supplementary Table 1 , inter-rater reliability versus reference).",
    "ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada.",
    "IRCCS Mondino, Pavia; OU8, University of Naples, Naples; OU9, Centro Neurolesi \"Bonino-Pulejo\", Messina.",
    "After the assessment of the homoscedasticity with the Bartlett test, MPRAGE phantom acquisition scans were compared among different I-ADNI sites using the analysis of the variance (ANOVA).",
    "The main software adopted during the site qualification phase were ImageJ, MIPAV, MRIcro, MNI tools, and the Gradient Non-linearity Unwarping Tool.",
    "Moreover, known group validity by the Mann-Whitney U-test was executed comparing the hippocampal volume of controls and AD patients.",
    "This technique has been widely validated against manual tracings in healthy individuals and patients with neurologic diseases [20, 23] .",
    "The validity of acquisition and processing was estimated detecting: signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratios; quality control pass; comparability of craniometric features (intracranial volume) across scanners; and known-group validity of brain structural features (hippocampal volume).",
    "From the NA-ADNI database, we extracted MPRAGE ranking of 791 scans acquired by ADNI1 protocol and compared the proportion of MPRAGE assessed of high quality between the I-ADNI and the NA-ADNI.",
    "Results: Results on Phantom and Volunteers scans showed that I-ADNI acquisition parameters were comparable with those one of the ranked-A ADNI scans.",
    "Test-retest scanning sessions were acquired from a group of 9 volunteers (56% male and 44% female, mean age 42 \u00b1 18 years).",
    "We administered a set of neuropsychological tests to assess long term memory (Story Recall Test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, recall), attention and executive functions (Trail Making Test A and B), language abilities (Letter and Category Fluency Test), and visuo-spatial skills (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, Copy).",
    "It will now be possible to compare the brain structural features of patients studied in these Memory Clinics with those of patients studied in other worldwide ADNI initiatives.",
    "Relative stacked column graphs show comparable SNR and CNR values in I-ADNI qualified centers.",
    "From each volunteer, two T13D (scan-rescan) and one axial-PD/T2-FSE volumes (8 sites, 1 subject per site, 16 T13D acquisitions, 8 Dual Echo FSE acquisitions) were obtained.",
    "Indeed, although there was an intrinsic variance due to different population characteristics, when we compared ICVs computed from scans acquired with the same scanner model from different subjects we found homogeneous variances between the two cohorts (I-ADNI and NA-ADNI).",
    "The learning phase was considered concluded once each tracer achieved an intra-class coefficient of correlation (ICC) greater than 0.80.",
    "The major goals of the NA-ADNI are: (i) to develop improved methods that will lead to uniform standards for acquiring longitudinal multisite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data on patients with AD, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and elderly controls, and (ii) to build an accessible data repository that describes the biomarkers longitudinal changes [8] .",
    "These results indicated a reduced ICVs variability between centers and the possibility to compare the MRI data between different Italian academic clinical centers.",
    "In this manuscript, we described the validation of procedures of acquisition and processing of structural MRI in different Italian academic AD clinics following NA-ADNI procedures.",
    "A significant difference in hippocampal volume was found between AD and controls on 1.5 Tesla scans (p < 0.001), confirming known group validity test.",
    "The preparatory phase involved the collection of the I-ADNI MRI scanner features in terms of manufacturer, coils adopted, and magnetic strength (see Table 2 ).",
    "Post-hoc inter-scanner signal repeatability.",
    "Moreover, I-ADNI cohort showed a lower proportion of medium quality MPRAGE scans in comparison to NA-ADNI (10% and 28%, respectively), while the percentage of low quality MPRAGEscanswerethesamebetweencohorts (Fig.2) .",
    "The description of the practical procedures concerning the image transmission of the data collected in this study on a centralized repository at the FBF has been detailed to every partner of the I-ADNI consortium.",
    "The software used for the manual segmentation was the Multitracer V1.0 software.",
    "The activities of daily living were more compromised in AD than MCI patients (p < 0.001, Supplementary Table 2) .",
    "Seven out of nine I-ADNI sites exhibited similar SNR and CNR patterns to each other (p > 0.05).",
    "Starting from year 2 onward, the NA-ADNI MagPhan \u00ae phantom was circulated among all I-ADNI sites to measure post-hoc inter-scanner signal repeatability.",
    "Subsequently, we compared the homogeneity variances of ICV among scanners of the two different cohorts stratified by strength field.",
    "The sample of patients enrolled in the I-ADNI can be considered representative of those attending memory clinics [26, 27] .",
    "These segmentations were considered the reference standard.",
    "On this prospective, our study has some limitations relative to this ideal scenario: a) in the site qualification phase, useful to fine tuning all the acquisition parameters according to the NA-ADNI standard, each MRI site scanned a different set of subjects preventing direct comparison of the scanners; and b) only one phantom acquisition has been completed in all the I-ADNI centers, mainly due to the lack of time, preventing the acquisition repeatability and stability of the scanners in the longitudinal period.",
    "This is the first Italian study applying standardized procedures for the collection and analysis of MR imaging for AD.",
    "Details of the protocols adopted by the different I-ADNI sites are represented in Supplementary Table 4a .",
    "The inter scanner signal repeatability results from post-hoc analysis on the MagPhan \u00ae phantom are summarized in Fig.",
    "ICV showed homogeneous variances across scanners except for Siemens scanners at 3.0 Tesla (p = 0.039).",
    "Conclusion: This study has provided standardization of MRI acquisition and imaging marker collection across different Italian clinical units and equipment.",
    "Moreover, FTD were mainly men than AD patients (p = 0.003, Table 1 ).",
    "For each center, the intra-class correlation coefficient (absolute model) of hippocampal tracings was computed to assess the intra-and inter-reliability.",
    "An expert tracer from the coordinating center segmented the hippocampi of these images according to the protocol described above.",
    "The aim of the I-ADNI was to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the NA-ADNI methods enrolling and assessing a naturalistic population."
