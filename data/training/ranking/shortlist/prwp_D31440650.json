    "The literature found a positive correlation between FMIS budget coverage and PEFA scores (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2016, Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017) , as well as a negative relation between FMIS budget coverage and the deviation between planned and actual deficits (Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017) .",
    "It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world.",
    "This shows on the same plot the cumulative share of the number and volume of transactions.",
    "2019) has shown that the transaction profile tends to be skewed with few high-value transactions making up the majority of the budget.",
    "Budget execution systems across all countries can be mapped into one of the above quadrants, and the challenge this paper seeks to address is how to navigate from a sub-optimal situation to the quadrant that facilitates both control and the necessary flexibility.",
    "A review of a large number of countries (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2018, Hashim et al.",
    "This paper argues for a paradigm shift: to control for high-value transactions, while allowing for more flexibility for low-value transactions, without compromising accountability.",
    "This strategy could also be useful for countries where state of the art systems has been put in place, but the budget coverage remains low.",
    "Dorotinsky and Yasuhiko (2002) map out the various avenues of how FMIS systems can contribute to the larger PFM objectives (Dorotinsky and Matsuda 2002) .",
    "For full budget coverage, decentralizing the FMIS to all districts and lowest level spending units is often advocated, including in the 2016 FMIS diagnostic framework (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2016) .",
    "A rough estimation of this proportion is 20: 80, with larger countries being more skewed toward high-value transactions.",
    "This would yield useful results early in an FMIS rollout phase, and address some of the cost-benefit issues that are frequently raised (Glenday 2015) .",
    "by using a web-portal interface with the system.",
    "A sample transaction profile for a typical lower-middle-income country is shown in figure 3.",
    "There is thus little guarantee of the integrity of the expenditure data.",
    "These processes and controls associated with budget execution are shown schematically in figure 1 (Pattanayak 2016) .",
    "Last, the paper proposes an innovative deployment strategy for a budget execution system that would facilitate both good control and flexibility.",
    "To understand what the benefit and cost functions look like, it is helpful to visualize the transactions profile.",
    "All card transactions are aggregated monthly by service, to generate a \"record of bank transactions\".",
    "To overcome this conundrum, the paper argues for a paradigm shift: a purposeful policy shift that subjects high-value transactions to the full set of rigorous controls, while relaxing controls for low-value transactions that apply to important aspects of the service delivery sectors.",
    "This situation can be mapped into a control and flexibility quadrant, as developed in figure 2.",
    "In his seminal 1998 paper, Allen Schick outlines three objectives of a public finance system: (i) aggregate fiscal discipline -that budget totals should be the result of explicit enforced decisions; (ii) allocative efficiency -that expenditures should be based on government priorities and on effectiveness of public programs; and (iii) operational efficiency -that agencies should produce goods and services at a cost that achieves ongoing efficiency gains and is competitive at market prices (Schick 1998) .",
    "In practice, the spending units that generate these large transactions are few 1 and capturing transactions from these units would result in the same high coverage.",
    "Such an approach could yield a very high budget coverage despite focusing only on a limited number of transactions.",
    "This has been pioneered by the French government, as described in the box below:",
    "This paper recognizes the critical importance of FMIS systems in expenditure management, without which the desired progress in fiscal discipline and service delivery may be difficult to achieve.",
    "To achieve such results, countries need to distribute and record financial resources in a reliable and timely manner so that they can be audited to ensure that money is being used properly (Andrews et al.",
    "The frequency distribution of SUs which generate the transactions is not as skewed as that of the transactions.",
    "The paper proposes utilizing innovations in the banking sector to maintain financial accountability for these transactions.",
    "Some practical implications of what this may entail are addressed in the FMIS deployment architecture chapter.",
    "Applying these may require a paradigm shift but holds promise of a more effective engagement and achieving expedited results.",
    "This paper presents an alternative approach to expenditure management and argues that FMIS systems should be deployed in a cost-effective manner with consideration to fiscal risk and flexibility in budget execution at point of service delivery.",
    "In some countries, these make up 90-95 percent of the budget (Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017).",
    "Vendors must be registered (levels 1 & 3) and must implement software to transmit public market references (level 3 only).",
    "As it is critical to have comprehensive budget execution reports, all transactions executed outside the FMIS need to be posted to the ledger periodically on an ex-post basis and consolidated with the FMIS-generated transactions.",
    "Recognizing this problem, the paper develops a two-pronged, risk-based deployment strategy for financial management information systems: (1) deploy such systems to high-value transactions, and (2) use banking sector innovations for advance payments, such as smart cards or mobile money, to facilitate flexibility for low-value transactions without compromising the integrity of transactions or accountability.",
    "-Level 3 cards: These are used for purchases made within the framework of registered public markets.",
    "Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen (2016) have found that frequently large expenditure items are not channeled through the FMIS, in which case any controls would naturally not apply to those budget lines and thus open avenues for engaging in expenditures that were not vetted through the legislative process.",
    "This suggests that there are very high returns in terms of fiscal control for capturing high-value transactions, but the return diminishes rapidly as the value of the transaction declines.",
    "The paper continues to argue that these transactions, which constitute advance payments, could instead be captured on an ex-post basis through banking or mobile sector innovations such as smart cards or mobile money accounts.",
    "If the threshold is set at a low value (e.g.",
    "At the same time, the same set of countries are committing to invest in human capital and use an increasing share of public resources toward goals such as universal health coverage.",
    "Such a strategy could be a useful first step in implementing a reasonable budget execution system in countries that do not have one.",
    "US$ 1,000) then a very large number of SUs will need to be covered since most SUs will generate one or two transactions of this value.",
    "An overview of the changes required from a cash-based system to the introducing of e-payments for low level transactions through commercial banks or mobile money is provided in the matrix below.",
