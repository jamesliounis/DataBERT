  "shortlist": [
    "ARM data are the reference irradiance in this study, and the latest data available are used during the breakup forecast.",
    "[8] We derive a data set of breakup times and modes by analyzing ground-based observations recorded by a web camera, a coastal radar and ice observers as well as satelliteremote sensing data to arrive at a better understanding of the landfast ice breakup process at Barrow and examine its variability on the time scale of a decade.",
    "[28] In 2010, data are available on currents and sea level near UIC-NARL.",
    "On the basis of historical data, we inferred that both modes likely occurred between the 1930s and 1950s, and that breakup between 1973 and 1976 was likely thermal every year.",
    "Here, we took an approach employed in numerical sea ice models and advanced statistical models of glacier ablation by integrating measures of irradiance [Hock, 1999].",
    "Here, we summarize these observations through specific examples.",
    "In line with past studies [e.g., Reimnitz et al., 1994;George et al., 2004] we consider landfast ice as an aggregate of grounded pressure ridges and attached shoreward level and rubble ice (\"nearshore ice\"; see Figure 2).",
    "Recent work by Mahoney et al.",
    "RADARSAT and European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to complement the analysis were provided by the Barrow Area Information Database (BAID) project.",
    "The analysis of breakup in these studies was typically constrained by the types of observations (ground based, remote sensing) available for a particular location, with little intercomparison between different types of observations and very few long-term studies of changes in breakup dates.",
    "Independent of this study, records of Barrow community members are available on the first day of boating activity launched from the Chukchi Sea shore (C. George, personal communication, 2010).",
    "Here, breakup is defined as the date the ice concentration decreases to 10% [Kniskern and Potocsky, 1965], which is similar to our record of the breakout of pressure ridges (Table 1).",
    "[4] Breakup of landfast sea ice in the North American Arctic has been studied mostly in the context of ice trafficability and offshore oil and gas development [e.g., Sackinger and Rogers, 1974;Spedding, 1983;Barry et al., 1979] or coastal dynamics [Short and Wiseman, 1975;Shapiro and Barnes, 1991].",
    "Yet, within the limits discussed above, the consistently acquired set of physical observations can be used as indicator for conditions that are meaningful in a broader context.",
    "[26] Breakup dates and the period of disappearance of pressure ridges at UIC-NARL are summarized in Table 1 and shown in Figure 8 (Appendix A).",
    "[47] Differences in the dates of breakup and boating presented here may serve to illustrate that stages of the sea ice cycle are defined in relation to a specific purpose or use of the ice cover [Eicken et al., 2009].",
    "While we were not able to find comparisons between model forecasts and observations, Gudkovich specifies predictive success relative to climatology at 20 to 35%.",
    "[2007a] provided an update on earlier work for the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas but relied exclusively on remote sensing observations with data acquired at 10 day intervals.",
    "Also, regions with low forecasting skill may turn out to exhibit a bimodal distribution of breakup modes similar to Barrow, a potentially helpful insight for forecasting.",
    "On the basis of ARM data, 2002 exhibited a significant reduction of tundra albedo by 25 May, 1 to 2 weeks earlier than in other years since 2000.",
    "melt seasons 2009 and 2010 (presented in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Regional Sea Ice Outlook; www.arcus.org/search/seaiceoutlook).",
    "[1979] state that 55 to 140 and 140 to 220 melting degree days (MDD) are required to observe opening and movements of nearshore landfast ice and complete clearance of landfast ice off coast, respectively.",
    "On the basis of a start date of 5 June, years of thermal breakup accumulated between 700 and 760 MJ/m 2 , while years of mechanical breakup and 2002 experienced breakup after 560 to 590 MJ/m 2 , with the exception of 2010 in which 700 MJ/m 2 were accumulated ( Table 1).",
    "As a result, this appears to be one of the first studies of the interannual variability of the breakup process of landfast sea ice.",
    "[12] Our measurements at Barrow [Druckenmiller et al., 2009] show that ice thickness of level nearshore ice increases from 0.6 to 0.8 m in January to reach its maximum of 1.4 to 1.6 m in mid-May.",
    "On the basis of a summary of 25 (unspecified) years of observation starting in the 1930s, according to their definition, breakup at Point Barrow happened at the earliest and latest on 15 June and 24 August, respectively, with an average given as 24 July [Kniskern and Potocsky, 1965].",
    "The range reported by Bilello [1980] for the complete removal of ice at Resolute was higher (120 to 190 melting degree days), similar to the respective range reported by Barry et al.",
    "Data from Barrow indicate that thermal breakup occurred once a threshold in the cumulative irradiance recorded at the ARM site had been passed (700 MJ/m 2 , starting integration at 5 June; cf.",
    "[44] While 2 years is too short a time to reach definite conclusions about the skill of forecasts of springtime irradiance, the consistency in forecast breakup dates ( Figure 17) suggests that systematic correlations might exist between forecast and observations at the comparatively long time scale of 2 weeks.",
    "Reprojected Landsat images were obtained through the USGS Global Visualization Viewer, while reprojected MODIS images since 2004 were provided by the NASA MODIS Rapid Response System.",
    "[49] Our observations can be placed in historical context on the basis of observations of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office [1958].",
    "[30] Figure 14 shows the cumulative irradiance at the time of breakup for different start dates of integration.",
    "[45] We focused on one particular definition of breakup in section 4 on the basis of a physical process at one reference location in section 5.4.",
    "Russian scientists have also developed empirical or statistical models that take into consideration wind speed and the local topography in predicting breakup dates [Gudkovich, 1995].",
    "The best performance would have been obtained for a starting day of year 158; that is, 7 June (cumulative irradiance threshold MJ m \u00c02 ).",
    "For example, investigating which of the two ice decay modes dominates at a particular location may guide the selection of indicators for breakup forecasts in the Canadian Arctic and elsewhere; for example, leading to the use of predominantly dynamic indicators in exposed areas and thermodynamic indicators in sheltered areas.",
    "While ice motion during the general breakup period in 2008 was complicated (see above), in all years for which we have radar observations of drift in the coastal lead during thermal breakup, ice in the coastal lead and nearshore ice at UIC-NARL drifted predominantly in the same direction (2006,2008,2009).",
    "However, among the 3 years of highest Figure 11.",
    "Ice conditions observed in 2006 are likely typical of this more traditional ice regime, as also noted by local ice experts (R. Glenn, personal communication, 2006).",
    "[54] We have compared two empirical measures for breakup progress, melting degree days and cumulative irradiance, and found cumulative irradiance to be the more precise indicator for thermal breakup of landfast sea ice at Barrow.",
    "The novel aspect of this work is the combination of an in-depth investigation of the breakup process, previously limited to studies of one season, with an investigation of the predictability of breakup, which is limited to long-term studies.",
    "[52] This work highlights the importance of grounded pressure ridges for the stability of landfast sea ice in the Alaska Arctic, and the significant interannual variability of breakup dates observed during the past decade.",
    "[5] For the Siberian Arctic, studies of the mechanisms of ice breakup have led to the development of simple forecast models [e.g., Spichkin, 1961;Gudkovich, 1995].",
    "The nearshore environment allowed us to observe the transition from the commonly acknowledged preferential melt of melt ponds on a single piece of ice to agglomerates of ice floes with significantly larger cumulative perimeter, marking the beginning of a nonlinear, catastrophic disintegration of landfast ice driven by both lateral, top and bottom ablation.",
    "Shapiro and Barnes, 1991].",
    "Brief periods of temperatures above 0\u00b0C were observed as early as April (e.g., 2002April (e.g., , 2003April (e.g., , 2004April (e.g., , 2005April (e.g., , 2009, at a time of ice growth and increase in snow depth and clearly before the onset of appreciable melt.",
    "While previous studies often considered breakup at multiple locations, the transferability of our results will still have to be tested.",
    "In keeping with common practice we express MDD in\u00b0C days (i.e., 8.64 \u00c2 10 4 Ks) [Petrich and Eicken, 2010].",
    "All modeling studies acknowledged the contribution of dynamic processes to breakup of weakened ice.",
    "In years where boat access leads breakup at UIC-NARL, coastal ice broke up in stages from the south (near the residential areas of Barrow) to the north (at the reference point of this study)."
