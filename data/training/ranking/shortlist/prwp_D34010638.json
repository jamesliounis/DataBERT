    "This paper contributes to two strands of the literature.",
    "Second, our paper contributes to the strand of literature on the (distributional) impact of energy subsidies on household and firm behavior (Komives et al., 2005; Davis, 2014; Younger et al., 2016; Basurto et al., 2020; Hahn and Metcalfe, 2021; Berkouwer et al., 2022) .",
    "Thus, data from these countries will provide comprehensive evidence of the effect of the pandemic and associated policy measures on households and firms in the context of developing economies.",
    "This paper uses administrative data on electricity billing records from Ghana and Rwanda.",
    "Results are shown in Table 1 .",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Results (DID estimates) are presented in Figure 5 (details in Tables 8 and 9).",
    "The dataset contains the billing records of the universe of electricity customers in Rwanda from January 2018 to December 2020.",
    "Abay, K., Berhane, G., Hoddinott, J., and Tafere, K. (2020).",
    "These studies range from the effects on food security (Amare et al., 2021; Abay et al., 2020) , wel-fare (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2021) , firms (Cong et al., 2021) , employment (Cortes and Forsythe, 2020; Albanesi and Kim, 2021; Klein, 2022) , energy use(Cicala, 2020), water consumption (Irwin et al., 2021 ), pollution(Zhang et al., 2021 , as well as the effectiveness of the government policies during this period (Gentilini et al., 2020) .",
    "We complement the electricity data with monthly data on temperature and total precipitation from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.",

    "In this paper, we examine the electricity demand response of households and firms to the COVID pandemic in Africa using unique administrative data on billing records from Ghana and Rwanda.",
    "We use data on billing records of the universe of electricity customers of the ECG from January 2018 to December 2020.",
    "To address these challenges, we leverage the detailed (panel) nature of our datasets and model electricity consumption at the customer level before and after the roll-out of the COVID lockdowns (SAH) compared against the typical (average) consumption levels during the same period in the previous years (Irwin et al., 2021) .",

    "(2017) for instance, compares corruption experiences of citizens living in close proximity to gold mining firms with the corruption experiences of citizens living in areas close to a yet to be opened mine in a difference-in-difference design to estimate the effect of mining on corruption in Africa.",
    "where DID \u03c9 essentially measures the changes in electricity consumption during the COVID months relative to the typical consumption levels in the same periods during the previous years.",
    "This result is in line with economic data from several countries indicating the devastating impact of the pandemic on the tourism sector's contribution to GDP 19 due to SAH and restrictions on international travels (Mulder, 2020; Abbas et al., 2021) .",
    "Results on the DID estimates are presented in Table 2 , while the first difference estimates are shown in Table  A1 in the Appendix.",
    "To this end, we estimate the dynamic model specified in equation (1) for the various user categories as well as the full sample.",
    "The results in Figure 1 show interesting trends, that plausibly reflects the dynamic responses of various users to the effects of the pandemic.",
    "The parameters of interest are the DID estimates, which compare the pre-post differences in consumption during the period March-December 2020 with the average pre-post differences in consumption over the same period in the pre-pandemic years.",
    "This paper examines the effect of the COVID pandemic on electricity consumption patterns among households and firms in Sub-Saharan Africa using administrative data on billing records from Ghana and Rwanda.",
    "First, the broader literature on the effects of COVID-19 on households and firms in emerging economies.",
    "The DID estimates are presented in Table 3 and Figure 2 .",
    "The results in Table 1 suggest that the pandemic led to a modest, 1.7% increase in (monthly) electricity consumption in Rwanda (column 2).",
    "Similar to the analysis in Section 5.1, we begin by looking at the average effects of the pandemic on electricity consumption in Ghana, estimated separately for the various user groups, as shown in Table 6 .",
    "The DID estimate in column 2 suggests that overall, relative to the pre-COVID lockdown period, electricity consumption increased by about 20.8%.",
    "Thus, comparatively, the results provide suggestive evidence that the electricity subsidies played a key role in the relatively high increase in electricity consumption during the COVID period in Ghana.",
    "Taken together, the analysis of the Rwandan electricity data suggests a modest increase in electricity consumption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit, non-residential electricity consumption experienced large declines.",
    "The results as shown in Figure 6 reveal interesting trends in the responses to the subsidy.",
    "Overall, the findings from this paper highlight the effects of the pandemic on households and firms, and the role of relief measures such as subsidies in mitigating the effect of the pandemic on end-users.",
    "For each customer and year-month, it records the amount (kWh) of electricity consumed, the monetary value in Ghana Cedis (GHS), meter type (postpaid vs prepaid), and location (district) of the customer.",

    "For instance, in Figure 1a , while the consumption of electricity by all users increased by about 2% during the start of the COVID lockdown in Rwanda, consumption declined by approximately the same level in the second month of the lockdown (April 2020), before rising steadily thereafter, to about 5%, seven months after the start of the pandemic.",
    "We show the results in Table 11 .",
    "(2022) that the (initial) design of the subsidies was (plausibly) regressive, our back-of-envelop calculations based on administrative data on actual consumption suggest that the eventual extension of the subsidy period for low-income households made the program progressive than regressive.",
    "The Ghana data comes from the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), which is the largest distributor in the country with operations in the southern and middle belts.",
    "Cicala (2020) for instance shows that the COVID pandemic led to a substantial increase in electricity consumption by residential customers in the United States."
