  "shortlist": [
    "The specific section of interest is cited below:",
    "At this juncture we exam the finding and start with the results indicated in Table 1 .",
    "For this study data were obtained for all school district in the state of Illinois.",
    "In general testing results could be improved and it seems to be feasible in the context of the findings in Tables 1 and 4 .",
    "Thus, c4 = 86.7-0.0000022 p1 +0.137p2-0.713 c3\nThis can be represented as a F-statistic = 9.38 and p value = 0.01 Table 5 : Highest paid high school principals (estimates).",
    "As we see in Table 2 the constant terms is statistically significant and twice the value as reflected in Table 1 .",
    "There are other results of this study that need to be addressed.",
    "The source of the data is the Illinois State Board of Education.",
    "What we see at the high school level in Table 3 the variable representing the number of low-income students is inversely related to the dependent variable as before not at same strength but statistically significant.",
    "The constant term is useful here because it is statically significant and indicates that the slope for the parameters of best fit in the regression model.",
    "The state board all so provides data pertaining to percent of low income students by school district, the years of experience for teachers at the elementary and high school levels by school districts, and most importantly the percent of students at/or exceeding standards (high school and elementary) levels by school district.",
    "In fact, based on the correlations as the average salaries for the top ten school districts increase the percent of students meeting or exceeding standards decreases, which is statistically significant that is while controlling for the percent of low-income students.",
    "They must publish the average results for all students, as well as the results broken down by ethnic groups and other subsets.",
    "Going back to the discussion of the constant term please observe that from model one to model four it decreases in importance as the coefficients and also in statistical significance.",
    "The key point is that the variable, the number of low-income students, is inversely related and at relative high level of statistical significance.",
    "The affluent districts in Tables 2 and 3 by high years are challenged by high school drop rates for minority students who are disproprotionately represented in the low-income student category in such school districts This helps to reduce the low-income student impact at the high school level (from roughly (-12 to-3 in terms of statistical significance).",
    "The hypotheses are as follows:\n1.",
    "As indicated in Tables 5 and 6 there are the findings pertaining to the highest paid teachers and principals in the State of Illinois.",
    "For this study there are four major hypotheses as follows:\n1.",
    "Based on the findings of the study there is evidence that challenges the assumption of the current administration regarding the effectiveness of monetary incentives to reduce the poor test results of low-income students [3] [4] [5] .",
    "Data are utilized for both high and elementary teachers.",
    "For the lowest salary per school district as presented in Table 4 the impact of the number of low-income students has diminished considerably to the effect of not being statistically significant.",
    "Data are utilized for both high school and elementary principals.",
    "Results from the 2009 National Assessment of Education Progress, commonly called the Nation's Report Card, showed Chicago's eight graders scored 27 points lower (out of 300 total) than their peers nationwide in their understanding of several core areas of science; physical, life, earth and space.",
    "The study uses linear regression for multiple variables with equations stated as follows:\n1. c4 = c5 +c2 -c3 where c4 = 92.9 -0.00014 c5 +0.276 c2-0.337 c3\nThis can be represented as a 3. c4 = c5+ c2 -c3 where c4 = 13.0 +0.000437c5 +1.89c2-0.541c3\nThis can be represented as a Table 4 : Lowest paying school districts (high school teachers) OLS estimates.",
    "The results of the research conducted in this study challenges some of the assumptions of the current administration's education reform policies [1, 2] .",
    "Turning around the lowest-achieving schools (40 points)\nThis paper provides a study of the correlations of rewards, at least, salaries and student performance, i.e., standardized test results.",
    "The controlling variables are again specified in the respective models.",
    "Thus, c4 = 129-0.0478 p2 -0.327c3 -0.0002063 p2\nThis can be represented as a",
    "Apparently, there are identified factors that directly (positively versus inversely) related to the dependent variable (testing results).",
    "Again, Jonathan Kozol has documented this in his work regarding \"apartheid education\" in this country.",
    "The variables are as follows: c4 = exceeds/or equals standards; c2 = years of experience; c3 = % low -income; and c5 = salaries.",
    "Again, these findings pertain to the 25 lowest paying school districts in terms of average salaries.",
    "The data for the variables are only for the top ten highest paid elementary principals in the state of Illinois.",
    "There is the frequent justification that higher average salary may be driven by the fact that in one district, for example, teachers have master's degrees and several have double -masters.",
    "Salaries and years of experience are averages for schools districts.The data for the variables are only for the top ten highest paid high school principals in the state of Illinois.",
    "Please observe that the coefficient of determination is at 99% with only 1% of the explanation of the variation in the dependent variable not being explained by the specified variable.",
    "However, this speculative and warrant further research but I hypothesize a school dropout factor.",
    "Let us see if this pattern persists for the high school level.",
    "The latter, however, is, once again, statistically significant.",
    "Mr. Duncan, Head of the Department of Education, said the estimate, based on an analysis of testing trends and the workings of the federal law's pass-fail school rating system, was the latest evidence of the law's shortcomings and the need to overhaul it.",
    "The sample is the highest 25 highest paying school districts.",
    "At the other side of the correlation is the percent of students meeting or exceeding state standards.",
    "Nevertheless, close to 50% of the coefficient of determination is reflected in the selection of the specified variables.",
    "Building data systems that measure student growth and success, and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction.",
    "1. c4 = p1+p2-c3 which same as above except elementary teacher pertains for average salaries (P1) and average years of experience (p2).",
    "The percent of students that exceed/meet standards is directly related to principal salaries and years of experience and inversely related to the percent of low-income students.",
    "At any rate, the relatively insignificant contribution of the variables teacher salaries and years of experience (elementary grades) has to be considered.",
    "At the elementary level, the variable highest average teacher salary is statistically significant yet the variable, years of experience, is not.",
    "Though Cities such as New York City, Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Houston ranked ahead of Chicago, the overall findings showed a widening achievement gap between urban and suburban districts that is of concern to the Obama administration."
