    "The analysis in this paper contributes to several strands of the literature.",

    "(2007) , Guariglia and Poncet (2008) , Cheng and Degryse (2010) , and Zhang et al.",
    "We then match the SDC Platinum data on the use of capital markets with the Bureau van Dijk Orbis data on annual firm-level balance sheet information for publicly listed companies from 2003 to 2011.",
    "To conduct the analysis, we rely on our merged data set that combines the SDC Platinum database on the use of capital markets with firm-level balance sheet information on the post-IPO period from Orbis and Worldscope.",
    "(2012) , Freund and Pierola (2012) , and di Giovanni and Levchenko (2012).",
    "(2007),Lane and Schmukler (2007),Shah et al.",
    "Throughout the paper, we report the data in constant 2011 US dollars.24 Although the size of total assets for the median firm without an issue seems small, this figure is consistent with that calculated byAllen et al.",
    "Our data on capital raising activity come from the Thomson Reuters' SDC Platinum database, which provides transactionlevel information on new issues of common and preferred equity and publicly and privately placed bonds with an original maturity of more than one year.",
    "This table reports the quantile and mean regressions of sales on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction term with these two dummies.",

    "This table reports the quantile and mean regressions of total assets on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction term with these two dummies.",
    "Based on the matched SDC-Orbis data set, in China, 425 firms are equity users, 195 are bond users, and 1,915 are non-users; in India, those numbers are 727, 291, and 3,428, respectively.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "These data are augmented with data from other sources such as offering circulars, prospectus, surveys of investment banks, brokers, and other financial advisors, news sources, trade publications, and wires.",
    "We focus the analysis on some key performance indicators (described in Appendix Table   1 ).",
    "6 We also use the Thomson Reuters' Worldscope database to obtain information on capital expenditures and to check the robustness of the results.",
    "To study this, we estimate four density estimates: two for the distribution of firm size as of 2003 (one for users and one for non-users of capital market financing) and two analogous ones as of 2010.",
    "5 To do so, we compile transaction-level information on new capital raising issues of common and preferred equity from 1990 to 2011 and on corporate bond issues from 2000 to 2011 from Thomson Reuters' Security Data Corporation (SDC) Platinum database.",
    "The data 15 Our merged data set comprises both financial and non-financial firms.",

    "To obtain information on firm investments, which is not available in the Orbis database, we match the SDC Platinum database on the use of capital markets with the Thomson Reuters' Worldscope database, which also contains balance sheet information for listed firms.",
    "To conduct the analysis, we assemble a unique and comprehensive data set on domestic and international capital raising activity and performance by Chinese and Indian firms.",
    "Notably, all these differences between users and non-users are associated with the 7 These findings are consistent with a growing literature that highlights that the top firms in a country play a particularly important role in more aggregate outcomes.",
    "(Allen et al., 2005 ), but a firm-level survey suggests that bank financing has spurred firm growth (Ayyagari et al., 2010) .",
    "This paper contributes to this literature by studying how widespread the use of capital markets by firms is, as well as the firm dynamics around the capital raising activity, in comparison to a relevant control group of publicly listed firms.",
    "The top and the bottom 1 percent of the observations for each dependent variable are excluded from the sample in this This table reports the panel regressions of firm attributes on a three-year window around (non-IPO) capital raising issues that took place between 2003 and 2011.",
    "(1999),Cooley and Quadrini (2001),Guiso et al.",
    "The results typically reinforce the findings from the Cox regressions (Table 2, right panels).",
    "(2012), among many others.",
    "The regressions also provide evidence that the distributions of both users and non-users shifted between 2003 and 2010.",
    "27 We compute this type of event studies for each of the firm-level attributes analyzed above using dummy variables that estimate a three-year window around the use of capital markets.",
    "To analyze the characteristics and performance of the firms that issue and of those that do not issue in domestic and foreign capital markets, we match the data on security issuances from SDC Platinum with firm-level balance sheet data from the Bureau van Dijk's Orbis database over the 2003-2011 period.",
    "Third, we obtained similar results using the Worldscope data, as further described in Section 4.3.",
    "The regressions use all the available data for all firms in our data set.",
    "The top and the bottom 1 percent of the observations for each independent variable are excluded from the sample in this This table reports the panel regressions of firm attributes on a three-year window around (non-IPO) capital raising issues that took place between 2003 and 2011.",
    "We first test the differences in medians between users and non-users of capital markets for a set of firm attributes by pooling all firm-year observations ( Table 1 ).",
    "(forthcoming), and references therein.",
    "The differences in the density functions between equity or bond users and non-users in both China and India are all statistically significant according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests ( Figure 5 , bottom panel).",
    "This data set covers issues by 3,884 firms from China and 6,483 firms from India.",
    "This table reports the panel regressions of firm attributes on a three-year window around (non-IPO) capital raising issues that took place between 2003 and 2011.",
    "Section 2 describes the data.",
    "In particular, we pool the information on firm size at two points in time, 2003 and 2010, for all firms in our sample and estimate quantile regressions on a constant, a dummy variable that takes the value of one for users of capital markets between 2003 and 2010, a dummy variable that takes the value of one for observations in 2010, and a term with the interaction of these two dummy variables.",
    "First, the findings are robust to the exclusion of SOEs, as shown in Appendix Table 2 .",
    "These trends for China and India are consistent with the evidence in the growing literature on the overall patterns of financial development.",
    "The dependent variable pools the data on total assets at two points in time, 2003 and 2010, for all firms with data on both years.",
    "To analyze the capital market financing and performance of firms in China and India, we assemble a new and comprehensive firm-level data set covering firms' security issuances in capital markets around the world as well as balance sheet data."
