  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "Data are available via Dataverse [50] .",
    "These existing data were derived from the Data.",
    "In each measure, we used the 2014-2015 school-level data from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data, as the numerator [61].",
    "The low access measures derived from the 2010 Decennial Census, the 2010-2014 American Community Survey, locational data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and TDLinex, and the Nielson directories of supermarkets and large grocery stores that serve as \"proxies for the complete set of stores that sell a wide variety of healthy foods at affordable prices\" [58] (p. 2).",
    "A limitation of this study is that data used in these analyses were collected across different years, ranging from 2010 to 2017.",
    "Table 3 have statistically significant model chi-square values, which suggest the models significantly and reliably predict a school's open campus policy.",
    "Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for each study variable.",
    "Table 3 summarizes the results from our logistic regression analyses.",
    "This study contributes to previous research by advancing a new empirical analysis of the prevalence of open campus policies among Oregon public high schools, and it is the first to identify multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding.",
    "Our guiding theoretical considerations informed the development of this variable [27] [28] [29] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",
    "In two of the cases, we used High-schools.com as an alternative source for accessing National Center for Education Statistics high school-level NSLP data from 2015-2016 [62].",
    "Instead, we drew on publicly available results of a U.S. Department of Agriculture-sponsored study to assess school exposure to food desert census tracts within a 500-m Euclidean buffer around the schools [58] .",
    "These findings align with our guiding ecological, systems, organizational, and institutional theoretical frameworks [27] [28] [29] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",
    "However, the effects of the walkability (OR = 1.035; 95% CI = 1.017 to 1.054) and the 20-mile food desert (OR = 0.977; 95% CI = 0.957 to 0.998) variables maintain their magnitude and statistical significance with the inclusion of the organizational environment variable in Model 2.",
    "Including the organizational environment variable in Model 2 also better accounts for spatial dependence in the predictors of open campus policy holding-as seen in the comparison of the Moran's I tests of the model regression residuals in both models.",
    "We based this decision on our objective to develop a parsimonious regression model wherein we use alternative and related measures of the social environment discussed below (see Section 2.2.3).",
    "However, that particular measure of food desert tracts has the greatest amount of variability (SD = 41.97%).",
    "Including the organizational environment variable eliminates the spatial dependence in Model 2 and contributes to better model fit with a higher pseudo R 2 value and smaller \u22122 log likelihood value [61].",
    "To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that identifies factors associated with open campus policy holding.",
    "Furthermore, at the time of this study, we did not possess high-resolution, geocoded food outlets data that are typically used for mapping food deserts [57] .",
    "Drawing on this literature, we explore the extent to which school-to-neighborhood SES and racial similarity is a predictor of an Oregon public high school holding an open campus policy, which would permit students to leave campus and interact with the proximate SES and racial conditions.",
    "These findings provide an empirical understanding of the associated multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding, and they enable more informed decisions moving forward regarding a policy with potential health implications for Oregon students.",
    "This is an additional area for future research.",
    "At the time of this study, we did not have access to the geographic locations of establishments typically used in previous food desert research as markers of healthy or unhealthy off-campus food options [52] .",
    "In Model 2, we see that a one-percentage point increase in the nearest 45 high schools that have an open campus policy is significantly associated with a 6.2% increase in the odds of the focal school within that organizational environment having an open campus policy (OR = 1.062; 95% CI = 1.036 to 1.088).",
    "We then summed each block-level SES and racial counts and divided them by their respective universes of housing units and population to create aggregated, neighborhood-level percent measures.",
    "In this study, we described the prevalence of open campus policies among Oregon public high schools, and identified multiple environmental predictors of open campus policy holding.",
    "Future research should examine these social environmental factors and their associations with open campus policies in states with more heterogeneous racial demographics to see how they fare compared with other environmental factors.",
    "Among this research, one study found that high schools with open campus policies had higher rates of motor vehicle accidents among high school students and lower participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) compared to schools with closed campus policies [14] .",
    "In constructing this variable, we also sought to address spatial dependence in the logistic regression model.",
    "There are important, practical implications of our findings.",
    "These findings could reflect real differences in the prevalence of open campus policies in Oregon compared with other states, lending credence for further studying the Oregon context related to open campus policies and their implications for students' health.",
    "To maintain consistency with the 45-nearest-neighbor threshold used to measure the spatial extent of the influential organizational environment on schools in this study, we used the same 45-nearest-neighbor spatial weights matrix to diagnose the degree of spatial dependence in our regression models.",
    "Upon including this organizational environment factor, the significant effect of the racial aspect of the social environment on the school's open campus policy holding that was evident in Model 1 goes away (Model 2; OR = 4.801; 95% CI = 0.490 to 47.015).",
    "The large standard deviation (SD = 23.19) around the mean reflects wide variability in walkability across school settings.",
    "An extensive body of research attributes youth dietary behavior to varied cognitive, affective, habitual, and environmental influences [2] .",
    "The effect of our racial similarity variable-i.e., the ratio of the percent of white students to neighborhood white population-stood out as a very powerful and positive predictor of open campus policy holding in our first regression model.",
    "Values greater than one for the SES and racial similarity ratios indicate, respectively, higher school-level concentrations of low SES students than neighborhood SES and higher school-level white composition than neighborhood white composition.",
    "This spatial weights matrix is row-standardized, and it resulted in 22.50% spatial connectivity between schools.",
    "We interpret these variables as indicating higher exposure to food deserts when greater shares of a school's buffer are covered by low access food desert tracts.",
    "Walk Scores are widely used in research across disciplines and have been shown to produce valid measures of walkability in the United States and other countries [53] [54] [55] [56] .",
    "Figure 3 shows the Moran's I values for the residuals from Model 1, which excludes the organizational environment variable.",
    "The effect of our racial similarity variable-i.e., the ratio of the percent of white students to neighborhood white population-stood out as a very powerful and positive predictor of open The 200 public high schools that we analyzed reside within 146 school districts.",
    "These patterns appear to coincide with the finding that U.S. public schools have, on average, higher nonwhite composition [37] than their surrounding neighborhoods, which may be attributed to the flight of white families from public schools.",
    "We collected data on open campus policy holding during the fall of 2017 for all public high schools (not including charter or alternative schools) in the state of Oregon (n = 200) using the Oregon Department of Education's \"Oregon School Directory\" [48] .",
    "Without the organizational variable in Model 1, the regression residuals in that model exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation.",
    "Additionally, aggregate data were used, thus potential individual level confounders were unmeasured and inferences based on these study findings are limited to the aggregate level.",
    "However, these are associations, and there is a need to evaluate the impact of open campus policies on students' lunch time food purchasing, dietary, and physical activity behaviors across rural and urban settings with varying levels of walkability and access to healthy and affordable food.",
    "Findings from this study provide helpful insight into the multiple environmental factors associated with open campus policy holding that were previously absent from the literature and potentially even unknown to the policy decision-makers themselves.",
    "That is, a one-point increase in the ratio of the percent of white school students to the percent of neighborhood white composition is associated with a 735% increase in the odds of a tract maintaining an open campus policy (OR = 8.348; 95% CI = 1.001 to 69.647)."
