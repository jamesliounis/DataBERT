    "There are a variety of databases that contain national data on a broad range of information related to higher education.",
    "18 Data is used by IHEs to examine existing curricula in science-related fields and businesses to understand and monitor employment trends in various industries and professions.",
    "The information reflected in the databases discussed below reflect a variety of survey methods.",
    "Following the tables, we provide a descriptive overview of each survey.",
    "This brief highlights several national databases yielding datasets pertinent to students with disabilities enrolled in postsecondary education including technical and vocational schools, and 2-year or 4-year colleges.",
    "Some databases have been revised over time; others are modified to conduct focused inquiries and reports to address current research questions and information needs.",
    "21 Transition and Postsecondary Outcomes Databases",
    "For each group of databases, a table is provided highlighting key features of the surveys.",
    "They are categorized in three groups: postsecondary education databases (data on current college students) longitudinal databases (data that are gathered at multiple points over time with college graduates), and transition and postsecondary-related databases (data on student outcomes including postsecondary education following high school).",
    "Although the list provided is not exhaustive, the databases presented in this brief illustrate that information is being collected at important points in time during a student's educational career.",
    "1 Participants for the BPS are drawn from the NPSAS 1 (See description below).",
    "Primarily, data serves to inform on doctoral level professional outcomes.",
    "The 11 databases described below reflect data from different points in time for college students with disabilities.",
    "Current databases are examining trends for students with disabilities before entering, during, and after graduating from college.",
    "Definitions of terms used in the tables include the following: \u2022 Target Population: The intended group of study.",
    "\u2022 Respondents: Individuals or institutions completing the survey instruments.",
    "They gather information from different respondents (e.g., students, parents, or institutions) on different constructs and variables of interest, depending on the purpose and focus of the data collection.",
    "22 According to the National Center for Special Education Research, surveys were administered and data collected at five different collection periods (referred to as waves) in the following formats; parent and student phone interview, student assessment using subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III achievement test, survey of school characteristics, survey of school program, survey of teachers, and transcript review.",
    "Information presented in this brief is intended to increase awareness of existing national data related to this population as well as help educators and researchers better understand current methods for tracking information concerning college students and graduates with disabilities.",
    "\u2022 Organization: The university or government agency responsible for managing the database.",
    "20 Data is used to track trends at a pivotal transition point from college to employment.",
    "While current data collection provides intriguing snapshots of elements of college access and success for students with disabilities, the field needs more comprehensive information and a more coordinated effort to gather data that can be used to better understand how students with disabilities are faring in higher education.",
    "13 Longitudinal Databases of College Graduates The B&B surveys graduates on employment and educational experiences after completion of a bachelor's degree.",
    "13 A designated sample of predetermined institutions, ranging from 2 to 4-year institutions of higher education (IHEs), is used to collect PEQIS data.",
    "4 Individualized reports are provided to universities interested in analyzing results while data from universities nationwide are pooled for broader reporting purposes.",
    "According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the BPS is used to examine trends such as the impact of financial aid on degree completion and other factors leading to exit from higher education programs.",
    "The disability types and descriptions included in the tables below come directly from the survey administrators.",
    "18 National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG) The NSRCG targets students who completed a bachelors or master's degree within the prior two or three years of data collection in a science, engineering or health-related field.",
    "For example, while the NPSAS database includes disability status of respondents, the purpose of the database is to report student aid information.",
    "Data obtained from the NSSE focuses on two main features of quality in higher education; student effort toward academics and student participation in university offered activities.",
    "\u2022 Access to Data: Data is typically available in public and/or restricted form.",
    "Similar to previous versions, data is collected in waves, with the latest wave occurring in 2014.",
    "Some are federal databases established to monitor and better understand educational policy and student outcomes.",
    "10 During the course of its use, the NPSAS has become a functional way to identify student subpopulations and therefore has served as a base of recruitment and establishment of baseline measures for other nationally administered longitudinal surveys including the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B).",
    "The SDR longitudinally tracks demographic and employment information about individuals who earned a doctorate degree in a science, engineering, or health field.",
    "While there are currently no databases focused specifically on college students with disabilities, several of the existing databases include datasets that provide information and perspective about the presence and experience of this population of college students.",
    "Definitions of disability and the types of disability reported vary widely across the various databases, making it difficult to interpret findings and examine trends across educational contexts.",
    "6 Institutional representatives are responsible for reporting on various content areas at three different data collection periods per year.",
    "The survey yields information about incoming students on a range of topics including general demographics, academic performance, student values, and decisions regarding college selection and financing education.",
    "The term public access refers to data that is available in multiple formats to anyone online including students, parents, faculty, researchers, media, or institutional representatives.",
    "\u2022 Record History: The dates of survey administration.",
    "The NSCG tracks a wide range of demographic information (e.g., age, race, citizenship status, disability status), professional and educational information (e.g., employment status, job satisfaction, salary, school enrollment status), and personal information (e.g., marital status, number of children, educationrelated loan debt) on students who have graduated from college with at least a bachelor's degree.",
    "Sampling occurs in a two-phase process by which institutions are identified using the IPEDS.",
    "However, there are significant gaps in the size and scope of disability-related data that is gathered.",
    "Then, individual participants who received a degree in the aforementioned fields are selected for participation.",
    "Others are housed at universities with research centers of national scope.",
    "10 Data collected from the NPSAS is used by the federal government to guide policy making regarding financial aid.",
    "Content on the B&B includes general information about advanced degree attainment and employment, but also inquires specifically about teacher related trends such as preparation and persistence at employment within the field.",
    "5 Surveys are administered in paper and online formats and commonly administered in large groups settings with a proctor.",
    "22 NLTS2 data is used to examine post high school outcomes for students with disabilities."
