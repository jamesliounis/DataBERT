    "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.",
    "All statistical analyses were performed using SAS package, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and significance was set at p\u2264 0.05.",
    "Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01.",
    "This research project used data from the BLSA, an ongoing prospective study of normative aging in community-dwelling volunteers living primarily in the Baltimore-Washington area (USA) 9 .",
    "Overall characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 .",
    "However, this finding may have been due to the presence of more severe AC in the older age group, and the hypothesis that BMD mediates the association of BMI with AC needs to be further tested in specifically selected populations.",
    "In multivariate ordered logistic analysis ( Table S2 ).",
    "Thus, our data provide a potential link between the so-called \"calcification paradox\" and \"obesity paradox\" 1, 49 .",
    "Participants included in the present analysis were those with measures of pulse wave velocity, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT) images of the body trunk and abdomen collected at the same visit 10 .",
    "This information could not be gained from previous studies, most of which used BMI as one covariate among others, without reporting its estimate in multivariate models 12, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .",
    "Table 1 also presents the characteristics of study participants by severity of AC.",
    "The validity of our data was substantiated by the fact that traditional risk factors associated with AC such as age, smoking and systolic blood pressure were highly predictive of increase severity of AC.",
    "The trends of the variables presented in Table 1 did not significantly differ when considering women and men separately, although statistical significance was lost in some sub-analyses most likely due to the smaller sample size (see Supplemental Table S1 ).",
    "Because of the nonlinear trend of BMI and obesity across AC severity groups (Table 1) , a BMI-squared term was entered into Model 1 and a significant nonlinear relationship between BMI and AC severity was observed (p=0.026).",
    "The present study has some limitations.",
    "Variables known to potentially affect AC and/or showing significant univariate associations with it were entered in multivariable models.",
    "Though limited by the cross-sectional nature of the analysis, this methodology and the reduction in beta estimate we found in our cohort suggest possible causal pathways between variables 19 .",
    "Therefore, as part of the conditions necessary for mediation, we firstly confirmed the existence of a reciprocal association between the mediator (BMD), the predictor (BMI or body weight or body height) and the outcome (severity of AC) by estimating Spearman's correlation coefficients between these variables.",
    "However, whereas several previous studies adjudicated the presence and severity of AC from plain thoracic or lumbar radiographs 7, 12, 34-36, 38, 48 , we used a combination of CT scout images of the chest and CT slices of the upper and lower abdomen to generate a comprehensive severity score of AC.",
    "Table 1 Characteristics of study population overall and by number of aortic segments with apparent calcification.",
    "Comparisons between the AC severity groups were drawn by one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests, as appropriate.",
    "However, there was a borderline interaction between BMD and age (p=0.07) and analyses stratified by median age suggested a stronger relationship between BMD and AC in participants older than 68 years old (OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.60-0.97, p=0.03) as compared to the younger ones (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.62-1.07, p=0.15).",
    "Longitudinal research may shed some light on temporal relationships between BMI, BMD, and AC, whereas experimental studies may gain insight into the causal mechanisms by which a reduction in body size may increase AC, for instance through mobilization of bone calcium.",
    "Univariate correlation coefficients between predictors, mediator and outcome of the predefined mediation pathway are shown in Figure 1 .",
    "Results were consistent even after accounting for variables with significant univariate associations with AC and known to potentially affect vascular calcification and bone density, including physical activity, blood levels of vitamin D and calcium, use of vitamin D supplements and bisphosphonates (Table 2, Model 3).",
    "More importantly, the strength of the association between BMI and AC severity was reduced and was no longer significant after the analysis was adjusted for BMD, suggesting a mediation effect of BMD, as depicted in Figure 1 and previously proposed by Kovacic and colleagues 8 .",
    "The BLSA study protocol was approved by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging and the Institutional Review Board of the MedStar Health Research Institute (Baltimore, MD).",
    "Remarkably, in our study, as in others 25, 30 , former and current smoking was an independent predictor of the severity of AC, but no significant interaction was found between smoking and BMI or body weight, and the prevalence of smokers was comparable in normal weight, overweight and obese study participants (43%, 49% and 40%, respectively).",
    "We then added BMD to the model in order to examine i) the independent association of BMD with AC and ii) the mediator effect of BMD in the association between BMI and AC.",
    "Notably, mediation analysis in cross-sectional studies is considered a causal model that can suggests a direction of influence, based on pre-defined causal associations among the variables posited by the investigator (Figure 1 ).",
    "As shown in Figure 2 , both normal (OR: 1.76; 95%CI 1.24-2.50, p=0.0015) and obese (OR: 1.23; 95%CI 0.84-1.80, p=0.295) participants had higher AC severity than the intermediate overweight group.",
    "Due to the high mean age of the sample (67\u00b113 years), 70% of participants included in the present analysis (229 women and 251 men) had evidence of calcification involving at least one aortic segment.",
    "We then used a mediation pathway approach 19 and calculate the percentage decrease of odds ratio for BMI after adjusting the model for BMD (see Figure 1 and its legend).",
    "To better understand the meaning of this quadratic relationship, Model 1 was run separately for participants with BMI \u226425 kg/m 2 (normal), BMI 25-30 kg/m 2 (overweight) and BMI>30 kg/m 2 (obesity) 6 .",
    "Race was combined into two categories (African Americans vs. non African Americans), according to previous literature showing lower prevalence of AC in the African Americans race group 18 .",
    "Interestingly, in this BMD-adjusted model, the size of the odds ratio for BMI associated with lower AC was reduced by about 14% and was no longer statistically significant (OR 0.967, 95%CI 0.932-1.003, p=0.0729).",
    "The prevalence of male gender also tended to increase across AC severity groups, together with the number of participants of white ethnicity and the use of lipid-lowering drugs (mostly statins), bisphosphonate and vitamin D supplements.",
    "The interaction of each independent variable (BMI, body weight, body height, BMD) with age, gender and African American race was also included in the respective multivariate regression models, to test whether associations were consistent across race, gender and age groups.",
    "A nonlinear relationship between BMI and AC was noticed (p=0.03), with decreased AC severity among overweight participants.",
    "Indeed, our findings support the hypothesis that decreased body weight determines a reduction in BMD, which in turn determines an increase in vascular calcification.",
    "Firstly, binary and ordered logistic regression models were used to assess the independent association of BMI with the presence and severity of AC, respectively.",
    "Our findings extend this observation and suggest that the same hypothesis applies to AC.",
    "We confirmed the inverse relationship between BMD and AC reported in previous studies (reviewed by Persy and colleagues 1 ).",
    "RESULTS-Age and cardiovascular risk factors were positively associated while both BMI (r= \u22120.11, p<0.01) and BMD (r=\u22120.17, p<0.0001) were negatively associated with AC severity.",
    "Predictors of AC were assessed by logistic regression, and the role of BMD using mediation analysis.",
    "Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals are adjusted for age, gender, race, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, LDL cholesterol, lipid-lowering medications, glomerular filtration rate, diabetes and smoke.",
    "Further prospective studies are encouraged in order to test whether such interventions may help preventing not only bone demineralization but also vascular calcification that happen with aging.",
    "From the original cohort of 711 individuals who met these criteria, 23 subjects were excluded because of missing covariates and 1 subject because of the presence of aortic and iliac intraluminal prostheses, leaving a final sample of 687 individuals, 351 women (mean age 66\u00b112 years, range 31-95) and 336 men (mean age 68\u00b113 years, range 28-94).",
    "Use of medications was determined at each study visit according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system recommended by the World Health Organization.",
    "Whole-body BMD was measured by DEXA using the Lunar Prodigy Scanner with version 10.51.006 software (General Electric, Madison, WI) 13 ."
