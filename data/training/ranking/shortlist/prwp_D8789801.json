    "For the data sources and detailed explanations, see Appendix 1.",
    "These data were kindly provided by Leandro Prados, who used them recently in \u00c1lvarez-Nogal and Prados de la Escosura 2006, which in turn were taken from Yun Casalilla (1987: p. 465) and Ramos Palencia (2001: p. 70 ).",
    "The source of both data is Maddison (2002) which is turn based on Maddison (1971: pp.",
    "The Chinese result is driven in part by the available data which focus on the income of Chinese gentry, the top 2 percent of the population.18 Note that the high intercept of the line indicates a very high income share of the very top (people even richer than the top 1 percent).",
    "29 Malanima, however, revises these original data, uses information about salaries and other sources of income, and constructs a new distribution (which we use here) composed of nine groups, each consisting of 10 percent of the population, and the top decile divided into three groups (see Malanima 2006: Appendix) .",
    "Estimated from Allen (2003, Figure 9, p. 428) .",
    "[ Table 2 and Figure 3 about here]",
    "The rest of the book gives the data on Chinese GDP and taxes from which one can calculate total household disposable income, and when combining this information with the estimates of gentry total income and its share in the Chinese population, calculate gentry's (upper's and lower's) per capita incomes (see the last line in the table below).",
    "[ Table 3 and Figure 5 about here]",
    "9 Gini2 is routinely calculated when published income distribution data are only reported as fractiles of the In the empirical work that follows, we shall depend almost entirely on social tables or tax census data obtained from secondary sources, including some estimates of our own.",
    "The source is Malanima (2006: p. 31) , who uses the tax census data from 1811.",
    "For example, in a regression using ancient inequality evidence (not included in the text) a dummy variable for colony has a strong positive impact on the extraction ratio.",
    "Interpolation based on the data for 1700 and 1820.",
    "1/ From Goldsmith (1985) .",
    "Goldsmith's (1984) estimates.",
    "Indeed, in his pioneering study of world incomes, Colin Clark (1957, pp.",
    "Area: Treadgold (2001, p. 5 ).",
    "Population is taken from Goldsmith (1984: p. 263) .",
    "From Milanovic (2006, pp.",
    "We can then transform (5) Note that the data we have here are: (i) the bottom cut-off point (y), the share of people above that income level, H(y), and (iii) the share of total income they receive, s(y).",
    "Maddison (2002) gives only population and income shares, but if we combine this information with Maddison's own estimates of GDI per capita for India (see below), we can calculate $PPP income estimates for each social group.",
    "15 In particular, this is likely to be the case for subtropical or tropical regions where calorie, by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) , who, in calculation of multidimensional inequality (income times life expectancy), use a calibration to transform these two variables into one.",
    "For 1750, from Bergier and Matthieu (2002: Mean income in $PPP.",
    "One of the best examples of social tables is offered by Gregory King's famous estimates for England and Wales in 1688 (Barnett 1936; Lindert and Williamson 1982 ).",
    "To underline his doubts, Kuznets once asked (rhetorically) at a University of Wisconsin seminar \"Do you really think you can get good conclusions from bad data?\"",
    "7 This inference should not imply a disinterest in actual distribution at the top; indeed, we will assess the empirical support for it in section 4.",
    "They are also bad data judged by the modern World Bank standards since those three surveys from the mid-20th-century would now be given low grades on the Deininger-Squire scale assessing the quality of income distribution data (Deininger and Squire, 1996: pp.",
    "Large regional differences are mentioned byGoldsmith too (1984: p. 265).",
    "The Indian population in 1750 is estimated from Maddison (2003: appendix HS-8, Table 8a, p. 256) .",
    "For population, see Milanovic (2006, p. 461) .",
    "[ Table 1 about here] population and their income shares are the only data given.",
    "The supplement provides a careful breakdown of gentry incomes by different sources, division of these income sources between upper and lower gentry, and the population shares of both types of gentry (see the table below which is derived from Chang's Supplement 2).",
    "We conclude with a research agenda.",
    "Goldsmith also gives the area as 3.3 million km 2 , while Taagepera (1979: Table 2, p. 125) gives 3.4 million km 2 (for year 1, wrongly labeled as year 0).",
    "This is reflected in the fact that some 75 percent of families were grouped in the second class (just above the indigent; see Malanima 2006 , Table 3 , p. 9).",
    "The 1872 urbanization rate (share of cities 5,000 or greater) is 16.2 percent, interpolated between and 1900 from Bairoch (1988: Table 26,3, p. 423) .",
    "This can be contrasted with Maddison's (2004) Income distribution data.",
    "Furthermore, while a relation between conflict and actual inequality has proven hard to document on modern evidence (see Collier and Hoeffler, 2004) , we conjecture that the introduction of the inequality possibility frontier and the extraction ratio might shed brighter light on that hypothesis.",
    "The 1750 estimate from Lees and Hohenberg (1989: p. 443) .",
    "Once gentry per capita incomes are derived, commoners' incomes are obtained as the residual (using total household disposable income, line d in Table below , minus gentry's total income, and dividing by commoners' total population).",

    "The estimated Gini of between 37 and 40 might seem low in the light of the excesses of wealth in Rome (see Table below with data gathered from Tacitus's Annals) But this extraordinary wealth was limited to a very few people at the very top.",

    "This is based onMaddison's (1998, p.12) assumed subsistence minimum.",
    "Using (1) and (2), we can link G(y) and H(y): Expression (5) is the key relationship that we fit in order to get the Pareto constant and to interpolate for the values that we do not have in the original data.",
    "Milanovic (2006, Table 4 ), based on Goldsmith (1984, p. 268) and the amount of alimenta paid from the public treasury to boys under 15 years of age.",
    "This point has been previously noted byJackson (1994) andHoffman et al.",
    "Income distribution data.",
    "The estimated commoners' per capita income of 4.92 taels should be contrasted with the estimated subsistence minimum (based on wage data) which was between 5 and 6 taels (Chang) .",
