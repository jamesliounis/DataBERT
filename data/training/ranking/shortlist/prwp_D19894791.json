    "Atkinson, 2011; Bleichrodt and van Doorslaer 2006; Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2011) ?",
    "The plan of the paper is as follows.",
    "The burgeoning literature has provided a plethora of measures and applications to data sets, from early attempts by Roemer and his associates (for example Roemer et.",
    "A recent selection would include Fleurbaey and Peragine (2013),Ooghe, E., Schokkaert, E. and Van de Gae (2007) andPeragine (2004).",
    "(2009) and the related literature have in effect analyzed the determinants of a range of outcome variables.",
    "Although the empirical analysis to which the literature has given rise is useful and is to be welcomed, current methods for quantifying and implementing the concept with a view to informing the policy discourse face a series of fundamental questions that remain unanswered.",
    "Of particular interest is a line of analysis established by the work of de Barros et al.",
    "2003) , to more recent applications in specific contexts like health (for example, Jusot, Tubeuf and Trannoy, 2013) .",
    "(2009) , attempt to implement in empirical policy oriented work.",
    "On the basis of this method, de Barros et al.",
    "(2009) use alternative metrics which we will discuss below.",
    "The authors further argue that the average access measure can be deflated by the dissimilarity index to give a measure of effective access correcting for inequality of opportunity -their Human Opportunity Index (HOI).",
    "The response of de Barros et al.",
    "This predicted probability is then compared to the average probability of access across all circumstance variables.",
    "(2009) explicitly highlight -with approval -the inclusion of effort and luck among these.",
    "And, conditional on a consensus or close to a consensus on these questions, can the inequalities be partitioned empirically in a fashion that is credible and meaningful for policy?",
    "(2009) could be that we are constrained by data which does not allow us to separate out the effects of parental influence, and that their estimate of HOI, just like their estimate of IEO, contains an underestimate of the true inequality of opportunity.",
    "A number of specific questions can be raised on the dissimilarity index and the implicit weights used for small and large departures from the average.",
    "Key perspectives in this, from Roemer (1998) , Barry (2005) , and Swift (2005) , are summarized by Jusot, Tubeuf and Trannoy (2013) [children's] efforts. \"",
    "(p. xviii) Again, that race, sex, location, and parental education and income are determinants of outcomes in the income dimension is not a surprise -it is a commonplace finding in almost every non-parametric and parametric analysis of income distribution.",
    "\"\u2026although the six variables employed in this chapter are a richer set of circumstances than those used in any previous study known to the authors, it is still possible to think of other relevant variables that are not observed.",
    "'s (2009) partitioning of influences on outcomes into illegitimate and legitimate.",
    "(2009) and we will take these up in turn in this section and in the next.",
    "But we are then up against the same set of issues as discussed in the previous section -the danger that the value of HOI is taken not as an underestimate but as a point estimate; and that the value of HOI across countries may be determined simply by differences in data availability, not true differences in equality of opportunity.",
    "The last two decades have seen a number of attempts to formulate the concept of equality of opportunity with a view to policy application, not least in the World Bank through its World Development Report 2006 (World Bank, 2005 and the subsequent \"mini-industry\" which has developed in estimating measures of inequality of opportunity using household survey data (for example, de Barros et.",
    "Of course the above example with parents and children takes us back to other examples in Cohen (1989) , which highlighted difficulties in Dworkin's (1981a Dworkin's ( , 1981b attempts to introduce the notion of responsibility into egalitarian philosophy by drawing a distinction between preferences and resources.",
    "In fact, as one of us has argued elsewhere (Wagstaff, 2013) , the whole empirical approach used by de Barros et al.",
    "The extent of inequality of opportunity reported to policy makers will be dependent on whether or not the data set collects certain types of information.",
    "He addresses the question of how exactly to calibrate the effort of an individual, and argues that the rank of an individual in the effort distribution across individuals with the same circumstances should be the relevant metric.",
    "The modern flowering of the equality of opportunity literature in economics owes much to the work of Roemer (1998) , who is recognized for example by the authors of the World Development Report 2006 (see World Bank, 2005 Bourguignon, Ferreira and Walton, 2007) .",
    "(2009) and Friedman (1962) argue the former.",
    "Most of the outcome indicators investigated by de Barros et al.",
    "The resulting subgroups are known in the literature as \"types.\"",
    "These difficulties are the subject of a large literature and debate.",
    "Thus the authors start with the outcome variable as being access to social infrastructure such as education, health, water, electricity, etc.",
    "Section 3 then introduces the attempts at application and quantification at a general level, particularly in the policy context, and presents a critique.",
    "For example, given the attention they receive in the media, one might imagine the big culprits in relation to diet are too little polyunsaturated fatty acid, and too much processed meat, trans-fatty acids, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat.",
    "The conceptual basis and implementation method is stated succinctly by de Barros et al.",
    "Thus, in this case as well, the number put out for policy purposes is a lower bound and open to similar notes of caution in the policy discourse.",
    "Thus the partitioning of influences on outcomes into legitimate and illegitimate has now been undertaken empirically in a large number of contributions across many countries.",
    "First is its systematic application in a consistent manner across a range of countries as done for Latin America in de Barros et al.",
    "This is not a trivial comparison: dietary risks are estimated to have accounted for more deaths worldwide in 2010 than alcohol and tobacco combined (Lim et al., 2014) .",
    "To this must be added another worrying aspect of the empirical approach.",
    "When presented with these findings, how might policy makers react?",
    "The strong suggestion in the motivating discussion of the study is that with this focus there is likely to be a strong consensus on the policy objectives: \"This study defines basic opportunities as a subset of goods and services for children, such as access to education, to safe water, or to vaccinations, that are critical in determining opportunity for economic advancement in life.",
    "The authors first estimate how the probability of a child's access depends on the child's circumstance variables: \"parents' education, family per capita income, gender, family structure (number of siblings, single-parent household) and area of residence (urban versus rural).\"",
    "But a more important point is that analogous criticisms can be made to this approach as were applied to the first approach discussed in Section 3.",
    "Indeed, it is nothing more than standard inequality decomposition analysis which has been conducted in economics and development economics for a long time (Kanbur, 2007) .",
    "Yet these are not actually the biggest causes of diet-related deaths worldwide: over six times as many deaths are attributable to people consuming too much sodium, and too little fruit, nuts, seeds, vegetables and whole grains (Lim et al., 2014) ."
