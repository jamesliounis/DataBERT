    "More details about the sample construction procedure, readers are referred to Ahsan, Emran,",
    "Similar to this paper, they recognize that the residual from a linear regression of children's education, for example, on a set of variables dening the circumstances is not a clean measure of eort as it partly reects the eects of family background.",

    "The summary statistics for our main estimation samples are reported in Table 1 .",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

    "There is a small literature that exploits the information in conditional variance by estimating quantile regression models of intergenerational mobility.",
    "(2012) and Hederos et al.",
    "The empirical analysis uses exceptionally rich data free of sample truncation because of the nonresident children at the time of the survey.",
    "(1) The data are from children who were born between 1950 and 1989 using the CFPS 2010 round for China, the IHDS 2012 round for India, and the IFLS 2014 round for Indonesia.",

    "The data for Indonesia come from Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) 2014 wave.",
    "The focus of the analysis is the parameter \u03b2 which is known as intergenerational regression coecient (IGRC, for short) in the literature.",
    "For our empirical analysis, we use household survey data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2010, India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2012, and Indonesia Family Life 3 We are not aware of any studies on intergenerational mobility that estimates the eects of parent's economic status on the conditional variance of children's economic outcomes.",
    "We use the following household surveys for our empirical analysis: China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) for China, India Human Development Survey (IHDS) for India, and Indonesia",
    "There is a small literature on intergenerational mobility that exploits the information in conditional variance using quantile regressions.",
    "For recent surveys of this literature, see Iversen et al.",
    "These data sets are suitable for our analysis because they do not suer from any signicant sample truncation arising from coresidency restrictions commonly used to dene household membership in a survey.",
    "The weighted RIGRC for various sub-samples dened by gender and geography (rural/urban) are reported in the odd numbered columns in Table 7 for our main estimation sample of 1950-1989 birth cohorts.",
    "The estimates of the risk adjusted relative and absolute mobility for the full sample are reported in Table 5 along Table 4 ) show that a failure to take into account the eects on conditional variance overestimates the expected years of schooling for this subgroup of children by 48 percent in China, and by about 26 percent in India and Indonesia.",
    "A large literature on intergenerational mobility focuses on the eects of family background on the conditional mean of children's economic outcomes and ignores any information contained in the conditional variance.",

    "For example, the estimates for the aggregate sample in row 1 of Table 7 suggest that the magnitude of underestimation in the standard IGRC estimate is 26 percent in China, 41 percent in India and 10.4 in Indonesia.",

    "( 42) The Evolution of Conditional Variance: Evidence from Decade-wise Birth Cohorts Table 4 reports the estimates for equations (1) and (2) for decade-wise birth cohorts: 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989 If we focus only on the mean eect as is done in the existing literature, the evidence suggests that relative mobility has improved in India and Indonesia over time, while it has worsened in China.",
    "21 While a CRRA coecient of 1 across countries helps understand the role played by the inuence of family background on conditional variance, one might prefer to use dierent estimates of the CRRA coecient for dierent countries when the focus is on interregional and intergroup dierences within the same country.",
    "14 As measure of eort, they use the sterilized residual from the regression of the residual squared (the residual from the earlier stage) on circumstances.",
    "There are dramatic dierences in the earlier cohorts across countries: the estimate is negative in China, positive in Indonesia, and a zero eect in India for the 1950s 16 The standard mean eects (see the IGRC estimates in the odd numbered columns of Table 3) show that the inuence of father's education is much higher for daughters in terms of the rst moment (expected years of schooling) in China.",
    "Section (4) reports the evidence on the conditional variance.",
    "A substantial literature suggests that a CRRA utility function with risk aversion parameter of 1 is consistent with a variety of evidence (see, for example, Chetty (2006) on the United States, and Gendelman and Hern\u00e1ndez-Murillo (2014) for cross country evidence including many developing countries).",
    "9 RIGRC estimates from the full sample (1950-1989 birth cohorts) for this subgroup shows that the standard IGRC overestimates relative mobility by 37 percent in China, and by 63 percent and 28 percent in India and Indonesia respectively.",
    "The estimates of the risk adjusted and standard measures of relative and absolute mobility across the distribution for rural vs. urban areas are reported in Table 6A for all three countries.",
    "The estimates of gender dierences are reported in Table 6B .",
    "In the online appendix, we discuss the estimates for four subsamples dened by gender and rural/urban location of a child (see Table A .1 in the online appendix section OA.1).",
    "This suggests that the positive eect in the full sample found earlier for rural India and the daughters in India is driven by the earlier cohorts.",
