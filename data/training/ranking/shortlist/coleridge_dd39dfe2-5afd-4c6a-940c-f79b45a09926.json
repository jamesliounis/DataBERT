  "shortlist": [
    "In addition to the references cited in the body of the article, citation details for the studies reported in the tables are included in the list of references.",
    "The mean and range of the estimates are reported in Tables 1 through 3, by crop, state or country (hereinafter, both referred to as state), and event (or transformation type).",
    "We were constrained by the data to use this measure as a common denominator so that the maximum number of studies could be included.",
    "A sample of studies estimating the aggregate impacts is also included.",
    "They collected farm-level data on the net benefits of the Bt varieties and, using the same basic modeling approach as Moschini, Lapan, and Sobolevsky (1999) and Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson (2000), estimated the distribution of benefits among farmers, seed companies, and research institutes/companies.",
    "They used unpublished market survey data, as well as published agronomic and farmer survey data to estimate their supply shifts in the US and assumed that the ROW would experience either the same or half of the efficiency gains as the US.",
    "Burton, James, Lindner, and Pluske (2000), using the same methodology as most of the other aggregate studies, considered the effects of various identity preservation schemes on the total and distributional aspects of the benefits from adoption of genetically modified (GM) canola.",
    "2 The purpose of this study is to collect and characterize the farm-level economic evidence for field crops available in the public domain, organize it, and determine if any general implications can be drawn from it.",
    "However, we have omitted the USDA study by Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride (2002), along with several others, whose results were based on the earlier (in this case 1997) ARMS data.",
    "(See also Falck-Zepeda, 1999.)",
    "Where the data permit comparisons, Bt cotton was more profitable than its conventional counterpart.",
    "It is worth emphasizing again that estimates of farmlevel impact summarized in Tables 1 through 3 are for a relatively small number of locations and years.",
    "But, as discussed in Marra (2001), in the early years this survey evidence was biased against the transgenic crops.",
    "1 Many of these critics cite early USDA estimates of differences in profit, pesticide use, and pesticide cost between transgenic and conventional technologies, from an annual survey known as the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS; USDA Economic Research Service [ERS], 1999).",
    "Most of the studies present their results in terms of total welfare effects and the distribution of those effects under various scenarios, or assumptions, regarding parameters they see as important.",
    "As more useful farm-level data become available for economic comparisons\uf8e7both in the US and, more particularly, in the rest of the world\uf8e7estimates of this type can be viewed with more confidence.",
    "Sources examined fall into one of the following categories: field trials, farmer and consultant surveys, expert opinion and secondary data, and studies reporting ex ante estimates of economic impacts.",
    "We obtained estimates of several measures of farm-level impacts associated with commercially available transgenic field crops from a search of the relevant academic journals, Internet searches, and inquiries of researchers who work in this area.",
    "Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson (2000) modeled the change in welfare effects from adoption of Bt cotton and Roundup Ready soybeans using a basic two-region framework (US and rest of world [ROW]), based on the approach in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1998), in which the farm-level benefit is allowed to vary among US states, creating several subregions.",
    "Table 2 shows reduced pesticide use is also evident with Bt cotton\uf8e7on average, a reduction of between 1.3 and 3.4 pesticide sprays per acre per season.",
    "Fulton and Keyowski (1999), in a theoretical modeling exercise, pointed to the importance of farmer heterogeneity in modeling the distribution of benefits when the transgenic and traditional markets are segregated.",
    "Estimates of differences in yield, revenue, pesticide cost, and pesticide use, and estimates of net returns to transgenic crops were taken directly or, in some cases, imputed from the reported information.",
    "The problem has been solved in more recent versions of the ARMS survey, but the early estimates are still being used to support critics' arguments.",
    "A few studies have attempted to estimate the aggregate economic impact of a particular transgenic field crop (or group of crops) and the distribution of the impact on the various sectors involved.",
    "As shown in Table 1, the range of differences in yield between Bt and conventional cotton is quite large, mostly because of the wide range of pest incidence in the years since the commercial introduction of Bt cotton.",
    "It seems reasonable, then, to look elsewhere for evidence of the farm-level impacts of these technologies.",
    "However, preliminary conclusions can be drawn at this point in several cases.",
    "Pray, Ma, Huang, and Qiao (2001) considered the impact of Bt cotton in China.",
    "Moschini, Lapan, andSobolevsky (1999) modeled the global welfare effects of RR soybeans.",
    "Some ex ante estimates were discovered, as well, for technologies not yet released for commercial adoption at the time of the studies.",
    "Based on Fulton and Keyowski, they assumed that adoption of GM canola decreased marginal costs at the farm level by 8.5%.",
    "One important aspect is the \"convenience factor\" for the RR crops.",
    "Table 3 reports similar results for other transgene types.",
    "They examined the sensitivity of their results to the supply shift assumptions and found that the magnitude of the shift for any region can have a large impact on the size and distribution of the welfare changes.",
    "In the two studies available the stacked gene cotton (including both Bt and RR technologies) compared favorably with conventional cotton, with an average 292 pounds per acre yield increase and a $243 per acre profit increase.",
    "It is time also for an initial attempt to quantify the nonpecuniary benefits and to gain a better sense of the economics of the spatial and intertemporal (externality) effects of conventional versus transgenic technologies regarding their pest resistance and biodiversity consequences.",
    "In the states where a range of yield differences could be reported, all show an unambiguous yield increase with Bt corn, although one estimate (Illinois 1998) is probably below the break-even yield increase that would cover the additional cost of the Bt corn seed.",
    "They divided the world into consumers and producers of GM and nonGM canola and estimated the distribution of total surplus accruing to each group under various assumptions about the form of technical change, the incidence of identity preservation costs, and the impact of a technology fee.",
    "They found that, for the 1996 and 1997 crops, Bt cotton adoption generated large global benefits and significant benefits to US producers at the expense of producers in the ROW.",
    "The estimates of farm-level benefits used in both studies are based on a consensus of expert opinion.",
    "Since its commercialization in 1997, the proportion of cotton acres planted to RR cotton in the US increased from 4% to 70% (Gianessi & Carpenter, 2001; USDA NASS, various years).",
    "The impressive rates of adoption for many of these transgenic crops are strong evidence of their perceived value to farmers.",
    "They found significant aggregate net benefits to farmers and much smaller benefits to the seed companies and research institutes/companies.",
    "The average per-acre profit measures for each state unambiguously favor the RR cotton varieties over conventional varieties in the four states for which we have data.",
    "Yet vocal critics persist, their arguments based in part on their beliefs that neither farmers nor other members of society benefit from these technologies (see Benbrook, 2001;Duffy & Ernst, 1999;Hart, 1999).",
    "Additional studies are warranted to estimate the potential pecuniary benefits more precisely using on-farm results based on farmer decisions.",
    "However, most of the available evidence for RR soybeans shows slightly lower yields-as much as a 5.7 bushels per acre deficit in Nebraska in 1997.",
    "Although definitive conclusions will require more research, the widespread adoption of this technology clearly indicates that the production costs are sufficiently lower to make RR soybeans profitable for the vast majority of growing conditions and farm types throughout the US.",
    "The most consistent result from these studies is that transgenic field crops have been profitable.",
    "Policymakers and consumers will benefit from better estimates of the farm-level benefits, because information costs are part of the cost of regulation."
