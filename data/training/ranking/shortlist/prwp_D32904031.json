    "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: a conceptual framework model is presented in section 2; section 3 outlines the data handling, data sources and the descriptive analysis.",
    "The data covers the universe of Malawian imports (about 3.3 million transactions in total) and is obtained from the Malawi National Statistical Office (NSO).",
    "The paper also uses unpublished and novel data of Malawian imports from the European Union (EU), spanning between January 2007 to December 2018 at the 8-digit level of the Harmonized System (HS).",
    "Our data differs from that of the study byDevereux et al.",
    "As well documented in the literature survey by P. K. Goldberg and Knetter (1997) , incomplete pass-through implies that the difference between the estimated coefficient and full pass-through is offset by changes in the markup when a cost measure is included as a control variable.",
    "See for instanceDevereux et al.",
    "This paper uses a monthly series of customs-level transaction data for Malawi's imports from the EU between January 2007 to December 2018.",
    "In comparison with the literature, the contribution is twofold.",
    "The ERPT findings are in line with the findings of Casas (2019) for these sectors and the higher tariff pass-through compared to exchange rate pass-through are in line with (Mallick & Marques, 2008) .",
    "According to Bacchetta and Wincoop (2005) , the currency of a monetary union tends to be used most for trade invoicing by members, but our data shows the dominance of dollar invoicing in world trade prevails even in imports from the eurozone.",
    "One key factor is due to the lack of data that details invoicing currencies used for both advanced and developing economies.",
    "As demonstrated by L. S. Goldberg and Tille (2005) , exporters are not restricted to invoice entirely in one currency, and this is supported in the data.",
    "Since the data does not provide importer and exporter identifiers, in order to have consistent prices and tariffs for each time the product appears in the data, we provide evidence in the next section on the mechanism to ensure that we are observing actual changes in tariff rates as opposed to changes due to importer characteristics or other unobservable information from the data.",
    "(2017) and who study imports of Turkey and Colombia respectively.",
    "Using highly disaggregated customs level data, this paper provides, to my knowledge, the first empirical evidence on the role of invoicing currencies in both exchange rate and tariff pass-through to import prices for a developing country.",
    "Table A2 presents the product level regression results.",
    "Second, it does so using very detailed data that allow identifying i) the country of origin and the product being exported (as in most of the related literature), ii) the exchange rate but also the tariff duty affecting the good's price in the destination country (while most of the literature typically focuses on exchange rate pass-through due to a lack of good data on applied tariffs), and iii) the currency of invoicing for the good (which is relatively rare information at that level of disaggregation).",
    "Thanks to these rich data, we are able to i) estimate exchange rate and tariff pass-through within an integrated framework at a high level of disaggregation, and ii) estimate pass-through rates for various groups of countries (Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members and non-EMU EU members), various currencies of invoicing (euro and the U.S dollar) and various sectors.",
    "Thanks to these rich data, we are able to i) estimate exchange rate and tariff pass-through within an integrated framework at a high level of disaggregation, and ii) estimate pass-through rates for various groups of countries (Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members and non-EMU EU members), various currencies of invoicing (euro and the 1 U.S. dollar) and various sectors.",
    "It is possible that the interval between product observations is affected by the pass-through, but given the data set, this is unlikely to be a critical factor and would not be likely to impart a significant bias to the estimated mean pass-through, and not the relationship between pass-through and invoice currency(Devereux et al., 2017a).",
    "This implies that in a month, there are several transactions of similar characteristics with a different tariff rate and we need to define a product and its related price that can be tracked over time in order to conduct panel estimation with a monthly series.",
    "The last three columns of Table 3 shed some light on this.",
    "These results are comparable to those of (Devereux et al., 2017b) who use the same specification, in that the pass-through of both dollar and euro invoiced products were higher (higher than the local currency priced products), despite the euro not having a large share in the Canadian imports.",
    "First, the paper provides evidence on pass-through rates on exports from high-income to low-income countries, namely from various European Union (EU) countries to Malawi.",
    "Since some countries joined the euro area during the sample period, we do not group member states solely based on the dates joined but also based on the number of observations in the two periods.",
    "For instance, if a country joined the euro area in 2014 but all transactions in the data are prior to that period, then this country is accounted for as a non-member state.",
    "The transactions that fit in these criteria can be observed at most once in a month and enables empirical analysis using a large panel data set.",
    "Figure 5 displays the dependent variable over product types in our time sample.",
    "Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.",
    "Although importers are not identified, the data allows for careful construction of unit values measured at the level of a transaction, extending beyond the traditional use of aggregate level data.",
    "where k is the currency to be analyzed, D k takes the value 1 if a product is invoiced in k and 0 otherwise, \u03c6 1 and\u03c6 2 are ERPT and TPT of products not invoiced in k respectively, \u03b2 k and \u03b1 k directly pick up estimates for goods invoiced in k. In this case, D k represents D U SD , D EU R , D GBP : dummy variables for observations of transactions invoiced in the U.S. dollar, the euro and the pound respectively.",
    "Based on the findings of Hayakawa and Ito (2015) and the theoretical model of Feenstra (1989) , incomplete pass-through means that an increase in T or ER induces the firm to decrease \u03c0 to reduce the impact of the shock on consumers prices.",
    "To test these hypotheses, we introduce dummy variables for whether a specific product is priced in the euro or the dollar, and include a full set of interaction terms with the exchange rate similar to Devereux et al.",
    "L. S. Goldberg and Tille (2005) found that non-euro area countries have higher U.S. dollar invoicing while euro area countries are more likely to invoice in the euro.",
    "However, it has been shown in the growing body of literature that most of the world's trade is invoiced in a vehicle currency, especially the U.S. dollar.",
    "The results are generally in line with theory, with some heterogeneity across sectors and whether products are from the EMU or non-EMU EU country.",
    "L. S. Goldberg (2008) found that the euro is mainly used by countries with geographic proximity to the euro area, but not extensively used elsewhere.",
    "Among the few developing country studies is Mallick and Marques (2008) for India, who find that on average exchange rate pass-through is a dominant effect compared to tariff rate pass-through in explaining changes in India's import prices.",
    "Estimations from equation 8 are presented in Table 1 .",
    "To arrive at a consensus for the tariff rate without having to average the rates within the set L, we select the tariff rate and transactions that most represent the transactions in the set.",
    "This paper brings these aspects in the literature together extending these studies to analyze the use of the euro in producer currency pricing and as a vehicle currency by EMU and non-EU European exporters in trading with a developing country and implications for ERPT and TPT.",
    "The asterisks indicate which group the country was considered in based on euro area membership, for the analysis.",
    "The sample includes 28 EU member countries (See Table A1 in the Appendix).",
    "Another study in this literature is Menon (1996) for Australian manufacturing, focusing on exchange rate pass-through and non-tariff barriers.",
    "The goal then is to select L r : transactions within L with the exact same tariff rate applied each time they appear in the data.",
    "(2020) find that countries that joined the European Union (EU), EU candidate countries, and other European countries have experienced marked increases in the use of the euro as an invoicing currency.",
    "The other \"anomaly\" for EU wide results where the symmetry does not hold, i.e.,",
    "Kamps (2006) empirically showed that a country's membership or prospective membership of the EU increases the probability of choosing the euro as an invoicing currency.",
    "Studies on EU trade and euro usage in trade have mainly been done with a sample of advanced economies and/or trade partners.",
    "Similarly, Benassy-Quere et al."
