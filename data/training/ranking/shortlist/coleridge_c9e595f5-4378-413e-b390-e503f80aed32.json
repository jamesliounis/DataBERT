  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from two public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study.",
    "First the datasets were converted to the BIDS format, then the t1-volume preprocessing pipeline of Clinica was applied [10] .",
    "Indeed, quantitative data can be obtained from different medical imaging modalities, for example binding potential maps obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) or gray matter (GM) probability maps extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
    "The rest of the ADNI dataset was used as training/validation set.",
    "These analyses are performed to assess the stability of the visualization method and provide a baseline value by using the inter-subject similarity for the different metrics.",
    "Different experiments were conducted to assess whether the method was robust enough to help interpret the results of the CNN.",
    "This indicates that the impact of the distribution of the data between training and validation is minimal compared to the initialization of the CNN and the training process.",
    "In the longitudinal analysis, all the sessions of one subject were compared by pairs and the mean value of these comparisons gave the intra-subject similarity for this subject.",
    "In this paper, we adapted the method of [8] to 3D medical images to find on which basis a network classifies quantitative data.",
    "For the cross-sectional analysis, the mean value of all pairwise comparisons of baseline sessions of all AD subjects gave the inter-subject similarity measure.",
    "For that purpose, a 5-fold crossvalidation (CV) was performed, which resulted in one fold (20%) of the data for validation and the rest for training.",
    "This experiment aims to assess the coherence of the proposed visualization approach with the a priori knowledge of the disease.",
    "Finally, though we explored the effect of four hyperparameters of the visualization method ( : , = : , = ) we did not conduct an exhaustive study on the impact of the learning rate and the number of epochs performed (correlated to the patience, the tolerance and the maximum number of epochs).",
    "Hence we need to check if the visualization method gives coherent results based on the CNN training.",
    "We used the T1w MRI available in each of these studies.",
    "The following sections describe the evaluation procedure, the hyperparameters selection and implementation details that are linked to the classification of AD vs CN subjects with CNNs.",
    "Table 3 These results highlight the stability of the method toward the hyperparameters choice, as two consecutive hyperparameter values led to two masks with a ROI-based similarity superior to the inter-subject similarity (0.80).",
    "This focus of the CNN on the hippocampi only may be partly due to the dataset: ADNI is a research cohort from which patients with multiple phenotypes are excluded, leading to a very homogeneous cohort in which the main symptom of the patients is memory loss.",
    "The ADNI dataset was split into training/validation and test sets.",
    "Indeed [15] highlighted that some visualization methods developed to interpret the results of neural networks (for example guided back-propagation and guided grad-CAM) did not depend on model parameters, as they gave the same result with a pretrained network or a randomized one.",
    "Once the architecture was chosen and the CNN was trained on all folds, the classification performance was evaluated on the independent test set to ensure the absence of overfitting.",
    "Moreover, we would like to study whether the visualization method is able to differentiate between overfitting, random and correctly trained networks.",
    "The goals of this work are to assess whether the visualization method initially developed for natural images is suitable for 3D medical images and to exploit it to better understand the decisions taken by classification networks.",
    "Preprocessing of T1w MR images was performed with the Clinica software platform (www.clinica.run) [9] .",
    "The model selection procedure, including model architecture selection and training hyperparameter fine-tuning, was performed using only the training/validation dataset.",
    "The population of ADNI and AIBL are described in Table 1 .",
    "We ensured that age and sex distributions between training/validation and test sets were not significantly different.",
    "The higher intra-subject similarity compared to the inter-subject similarity ensures that the visualization metric is robust as the same pattern is generated for different sessions of the same subject.",
    "This is an issue as the advantage of deep learning is precisely to be able to adapt to the rawest data possible.",
    "We could thus conclude that the network was not overfitting and we could use it for the visualization task.",
    "For both hyperparameters the similarity is high between two consecutive values (>0.90), as can be seen in Table 3 .",
    "A grid search was performed to choose the set of hyperparameters linked to the computation of the mask: the coefficients for the regularization : , = , : , = in equation (2) .",
    "The hyperparameters explored for the architecture were the number of convolutional blocks, of filters in the first layer and of convolutional layers in a block, the dimension reduction strategy (by using a max pooling layer or by setting the stride of the last convolutional layer of the convolutional block to 2), the number of fully-connected layers and the dropout rate.",
    "After having assessed the robustness of the visualization method, we applied it to better understand the factors influencing the training process of the CNN classifier based on several scenarios: for different folds (different initialization, different training/validation split) and different runs (different initialization, same training/validation split).",
    "With the prob CNN metric using the validation set, the dissimilarity between folds and 5 runs of the same fold are equivalent with respectively 0.78 and 0.82.",
    "The AIBL dataset was used as an independent test set to assess the CNN generalization ability.",
    "This problem of robustness in CNN training may exists for many medical applications in which the number of samples is not sufficient for the network to learn stable meaningful features.",
    "We first assessed the robustness of the proposed visualization approach.",
    "Other hyperparameters such as the learning rate, the weight decay, the batch size, the data preprocessing and the intensity normalization were also part of the search.",
    "The intra-subject similarity and dissimilarity were evaluated to 0.94 and 0.11 for the ROI-based and the prob CNN metrics respectively.",
    "For each experiment, the final model was the one that obtained the highest validation balanced accuracy during training.",
    "To observe this similarity, we reused the same masks as those produced for the grid search (see Figure 3 and 4) .",
    "The inter-subject similarity and dissimilarity were evaluated to 0.80 and 0.58 for the ROI-based and the prob CNN metrics respectively.",
    "This could mean that the regions on which the CNN relies on to identify the diagnosis mainly depend on the initialization and the training process and that the CNN training is not robust towards the regions identified.",
    "To confirm this visual observation, the list of the 5 ROIs in which the mask has the lowest values was extracted for each fold.",
    "The proposed visualization method extends the framework of [8] .",
    "We used as inputs GM probability maps, a proxy for atrophy, extracted from T1-weighted (T1w) MRI.",
    "This problem might be resolved by using more samples and with a better initialization, given for example by an autoencoder pretraining.",
    "We extended a visualization method to 3D medical imaging data and used it to better understand the decisions made by a classification network.",
    "To find the regions most related to Alzheimer's disease according to the CNN, we computed a mask based on the subset of images of AD subjects that were in the training set and validation set and all correctly classified by the network."
