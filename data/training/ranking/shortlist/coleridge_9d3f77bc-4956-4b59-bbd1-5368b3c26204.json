  "shortlist": [
    "Table 1 provides a list of all these variables from the literature reviewed for the present study.",
    "The ARMS data for U.S. rice farms collected in 2006 was used to evaluate the relationship between multifunctionality and a set of factors suggested by previous literature.",
    "Such statistics are computed in the empirical section.",
    "For the final model, higher education and technical assistance were found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 and 0.010 levels, respectively (Table 3).",
    "This study uses data collected for rice farms in 2006.",
    "This modeling framework is selected because of its wide application to many empirical studies and the fact that it is appropriate for a binary dependent variable.",
    "These variables and their sample means are included in table 2.",
    "For the initial estimated model, all the available independent variables suggested from literature in table 1 were included.",
    "Based on the results of the initial model and the descriptive statistics of the variables, a second model was estimated only including those variables at least minimally significant in the original logit model or strongly suggested in the literature.",
    "It should also be noted that each observation in an ARMS data set is given a weight to indicate how many farms it likely replicates.",
    "This assumption can be related again with the regions that in the last years had less intensive production systems.",
    "Greater numbers of observations could be generated by using a series of years and this might add needed variability to the sample.",
    "PROC LOGISTIC procedure of the statistical package SAS was used to obtain parameter estimates.",
    "This study contributes to the empirical analysis of factors associated with multifunctionality in U.S. rice production.",
    "We suspect that this sample size problem also rolled over to the individual variables.",
    "1 To estimate the functional relationships we estimate a binary logistic model where the dependent variable takes a value equal to one if the farm operator reports in the ARMS survey participation in conservation programs, recreation or agritourism activities, zero otherwise Past studies provide references to factors that affect the adoption of best environmental practices or participation in conservation programs for the U.S. (see for example Caswell et al., 2001;Lambert et al., 2007;Prokopy et al., 2008;Chang and Boisvert, 2009).",
    "However, the signs and parameter estimates for those variables suggest the effect of these variables on the decision to become multifunctional may be important in a study with a larger sample that includes other crops and profitability which has led to the expansion and consolidation of farms in Arkansas and Missouri (Baldwin et al., 2011).",
    "The final estimated model only includes those variables significant in the preliminary model, or whose importance was emphasized in previous studies.",
    "The study found that operator educational level and conservation technical assistance have a significant and positive relationship with participation in multifunctional activities on rice farms.",
    "But the lack of a \"state\" being significant suggests that there is a sample size problem.",
    "According to the model estimates, the operator educational level has a major impact on the adoption of multifunctional practices (figure 2).",
    "An intermediate aggregation could also be explored where multifunctionality is categorized into groups that are related to: (1) working lands conservation programs, (2) land retirement programs and (3) agritourism/recreation.",
    "Multifunctionality was defined for the purpose of this study to include participation in conservation programs and reported income from recreational and agritourism activities.",
    "Such an approach with the current sample would likely not be successful.",
    "Although there are similarities among various studies, not all the studies use the same variables and the impact of the selected variables sometimes differs from one study to another.",
    "Second, rice production has received considerable attention as a multifunctional crop in different regions, as for example in the European Common Agricultural Policy or in Japan and other Asian countries (Cooper et al, 2009;Matsuno et al., 2006).",
    "There are also potential issues of endogeneity in the independent variables that may be making it more difficult to find statistical significance.",
    "Given the large disparity in participation rates among the states just discussed, it is surprising that the state binary variables in the estimated model are not statistically significant.",
    "In such situations we suspect the weights can skew the impact of particular variables.",
    "Another variable, implementation of water management plans for irrigation, was found not significant but it may have an endogenous effect on the dependent variable as participation in a conservation program may require development of a water management plan for irrigation.",
    "From this sample, a total of 489 farms were included in our analysis.",
    "Yield is a potential example.",
    "In the far right column the values indicate the percentage change in the odds ratios for a one unit change in the independent variable.",
    "Since the estimated proportion of farms participating was 22%, there apparently was not sufficient variation to identify a state effect.",
    "The estimated logit model can be used to identify and understand the impact of factors affecting choice of rice farms to engage in multifunctional activities, either because farm operators receive income or cost sharing from conservation programs or because farm operators receive income from conducting recreational activities or agritourism on the farm.",
    "The estimated parameter sign suggests that farms with larger capital should be more likely to participate in multifunctionality, but it is clearly not significant, unlike the finding by Lambert et al.",
    "The effect of having some technical assistance is slightly lower with an impact of about a factor of two.",
    "2 The coefficients in the logit model are difficult to interpret, but the effect of marginal changes on the odds ratio for a unit change in one of the independent variables can be easily computed.",
    "Also, sample size could be greatly enhanced by expanding the model to incorporate different farm types rather than have it be solely a rice model.",
    "While the binary logit provides a point of departure for the analysis, future investigations should consider using a multinomial logit model.",
    "In part of our estimation it became clear that participation in Missouri was so small that to get reliable estimates of model parameters we had to combine Missouri into one state with Arkansas.",
    "Even with more years and farm types, expanding to a multinomial model with six different types of multifuncitonality might be beyond the ability of a logit model to find significant results.",
    "1 shows the estimated distribution of the total number of rice farmers participating in multifunctional practices for the different states.",
    "Based on the ARMS 2006 sample, an estimated 22% of the rice farms registered income for the multifunctional activities considered for 2006.",
    "However, as we subsequently discuss, a multinomial logit model could have application.",
    "These values are then computed by exponentiating the estimated coefficients for each variable.",
    "Table 4 displays the estimated odds ratios based on the estimated coefficients for each variable.",
    "Selecting rice as a case study to analyze multifunctionality in U.S. agriculture is useful for two reasons.",
    "For example, if large farms are more likely to be multifunctional, then their impact may be overshadowed by smaller, non-participating farms that will enter the estimation routine with larger weights.",
    "Using the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) we analyze factors associated with participation in conservation, recreation and agri-tourism activities as a function of farm structure, farm financial measures, production practices, and socio-demographic characteristics of the farm operator."
