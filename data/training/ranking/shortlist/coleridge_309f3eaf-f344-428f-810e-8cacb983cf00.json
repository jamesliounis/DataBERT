    "The Survey of Consumer Finances data have been extensively used for research.",
    "This study uses data from two national surveys: the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS).",
    "This paper compares the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey and the 2001 Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
    "The study uses three methods to compare households: Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and Gini coefficients of inequality distributions.",
    "Two studies are particularly relevant to this research.",
    "Regression models account for the complex survey design in the estimations (see Dubman).",
    "Milligan (2004) found similar results using data from Canada.",
    "The most recent 2001 SCF data include information for 4,442 households.",
    "Overall, the descriptive statistics and Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests support the life-cycle hypothesis for all farm and nonfarm households and by household type.",
    "The mean separation tests for income and wealth based on age group are shown in tables 4, 5, and 6.",
    "Only a few studies compared farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data sets.",
    "Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore provided various statistics on family finances of households and examined changes in finances between 1998 and 2001.",
    "With the Tukey-Kramer test, two means are significantly different from each other when ( ) where i y and j y are the means for group i and j, s is the root mean square error also known as the pooled standard deviation, n i and n j are the number of observations in the ith and jth group, and ( ; , ) q k v \u03b1 is the critical value for the studentized distribution of k normally distributed variables with v degrees of freedom at the \u03b1 significance level.",
    "Table 1 and table 2 provide descriptive statistics for farm and nonfarm households.",
    "In summary, the regression results confirm the findings from the Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests that both farm and non-farm households exhibit strong life cycle in income and wealth.",
    "This study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the economic well-being between farm and nonfarm households, based on the type and life-cycle stages of the household.",
    "Their results, using the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances, confirm that the life-cycle stages are important determinants of consumer debt.",
    "The ARMS data for 2001 include information for 7,343 households.",
    "The regression results show different trends by household type.",
    "The comparisons between farm and nonfarm households are conducted for all households and then by household type and age group.",
    "Both data sets include weights to expand the sample households in the data to represent all farm and nonfarm households in the U.S.",
    "(2002) provided statistics on the business income to total income ratio, the business net worth to total net worth ratio, the returns on assets, and Gini coefficients for both farm and nonfarm households.",
    "The results shown in tables 7 and 8 indicate that in comparison to the age group of less than 34 years, both farm and nonfarm households generally exhibit higher incomes and net worth later in life, with the exception of farm household's income with heads older than 65 years.",
    "Mean separation tests are also conducted for the three types of farm households and two types of nonfarm households, with these 5 types of households considered together ( Income and net worth exhibit patterns consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis.",
    "A more comprehensive analysis reveals that the level of income and net worth and their distribution among households and across life-cycle stages may differ significantly across different types of households.",
    "Poterba and Samwick (1997) found that there are significant differences in the portfolio allocation of wealth across different life-cycle stages using the Survey of Consumer Finances.",
    "Hopkins and Morehart (2004) compared the cumulative distributions of income and wealth for farm and nonfarm households.",
    "Specific objectives include: 1) to compare income and wealth of farm and nonfarm households using Tukey-Kramer mean comparisons tests, 2) to compare households based on their involvement in business activities for nonfarm households and on their diverse typology for farm households, 3) to examine the equality of the income and wealth distributions among different types of households using Gini coefficients, and 4) to examine the life-cycle differences in income and wealth of these households.",
    "If a pairwise t-test is applied to compare multiple means, then the confidence level would not be (1-\u03b1 ) but rather (1-k\u03b1 ) , where \u03b1 is the significant level and k is the number of groups compared.",
    "Gini coefficients for all farm and all nonfarm households and for groups of households based on their type and age are shown in tables 9 and 10.",
    "The objective of this study is to undertake a comprehensive comparison of the economic wellbeing of farm and nonfarm households using two national, representative surveys.",
    "With equal group sizes, the appropriate test is the Tukey test, while with unequal group sizes the appropriate test to compare multiple means is the Tukey-Kramer test.",
    "Several studies considered the life-cycle hypothesis.",
    "Three methods are used to compare the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households: the Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and Gini coefficients.",
    "Tukey-Kramer tests are used to test for the equality of mean income and net worth for all farm and nonfarm households and also based on household type and age group.",
    "Baek and Hong (2004) defined life-cycles not only by considering age but also by incorporating marital status, employment status, and the presence of children.",
    "The Tukey-Kramer mean comparison tests show that income and wealth differ among some types of households and are similar across others.",
    "While farm households on average are comparable to nonfarm households in well-being, the results from this study show that different types of farm and nonfarm households differ significantly from each other.",
    "The Tukey-Kramer tests and regression analysis show that both farm and nonfarm households follow the life-cycle pattern for income and net worth.",
    "The Gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula: where the households are ranked in ascending order of y i an i y and n i are the mean and number of observation of group i, respectively.",
    "The life-cycle hypothesis is also tested using regression analysis.",
    "However, when the means of more than two groups are to be compared to each other, multiple comparison tests need to be used.",
    "The life-cycle hypothesis is tested using regression analysis where the different stages of the lifecycle (ages 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, >65) are represented with dummy variables.",
    "Fifty one households in the SCF data reported that they had a farm business and are subsequently excluded from the analysis, leading to 4,391 nonfarm households.",
    "The t-test is used to compare means when only two groups are present.",
    "The results also show that similar life-cycle trends are followed by the five household types.",
    "Jappelli (1999) confirmed the hump-shaped life-cycle of wealth using data from Italy.",
    "A difference of 0.01 is considered statistically significant.",
    "These findings are consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis.",
    "The results show that wealth is slightly more equally distributed than income for farm households, with coefficients of 0.5659 and 0.5993, respectively."
