  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "The PET data acquisition details can be found online in the study protocols of the ADNI project.",
    "This multisite open-source data set was designed to accelerate the discovery of biomarkers and to identify and track AD pathology.",
    "The mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the crossvalidation experiment are shown in Figures 6 and 7 and Table 2 .",
    "The results of the comparison experiment are shown in Figure 8 and Table 3 .",
    "Demographic and clinical information of these patients are described in Table 1 .",
    "Although the data used in different studies are not identical, they all come from the ADNI database; therefore, they share a similar acquisition and preprocessing procedure, allowing comparisons to be made.",
    "As shown in Table 4 , we achieved the best results in accuracy and sensitivity and achieved almost the best results in specificity.",
    "We obtain the ROIs with spatial coordinates according to Pearson correlation of the sample series, which can reflect better differences between samples than single voxel or the ROIs obtained based on the Euclidean distance.",
    "Age, sex, and MMSE did not differ significantly between the 2 data sets as shown in Table 1 ; we propose DBN as the main deep model for feature learning in this study.",
    "As a result, classification experiment with RBF kernel has best accuracy, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) value.",
    "The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate the model performance.",
    "In the study by Lu 13 et al, the voxels in each ROI were clustered into patches through k-means clustering based on the Euclidean distance of their spatial coordinates, which means that voxels spatially close to each other would belong to the same patch.",
    "18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans acquired at the baseline visit were used in the present analysis.",
    "(2) Many other modality characteristics in the ADNI data set, such as clinical information, age, education, and CSF parameters, are not used, and it is still necessary to design a multimodal deep learning network to learn potential relationships among features from multiple modalities.",
    "As we can see from the Table 3 , ROIs extracted by the region-growing algorithm better reflects the differences compared to the AAL template; compared to traditional PCA, DBN has better feature extraction capability.",
    "Figure 3 shows the average of standardized uptake value ratio of samples in all ROIs.",
    "Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to validate the results.",
    "In this study, we achieved an 86% accuracy to predict AD from MCI, which is a better result than others reported in the literature.",
    "In the classification experiment, 3 kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and radial basis) were used for detecting features' generalization ability and classification reliability.",
    "Because similarity is measured through correlation, we chose to measure the similarity between 2 regions as the mean correlation between the series of any 2 voxels, each belonging to a different region.",
    "Suk 15 et al performed a 2sample t test on each voxel, selected voxels with a P value smaller than the predefined threshold, and extracted patches as ROIs with a fixed size by taking each of these voxels as a center.",
    "In the deep learning model, with a relatively small number of training samples, the DBN, which was stacked with RBMs, has certain advantages.",
    "Because in the case of a small amount of data, if the training set error is small, it may appear overfitting.",
    "In this study, a new framework for the early diagnosis of AD using DBN to extract the features of FDG-PET data is proposed.",
    "The feature vector mapping of the DBN is optimized, and the size of the input apace is simplified.",
    "Although our method based on a single modality can guarantee a high level of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity, some limitations and disadvantages also exist in our method: (1) Due to the limited data in the ADNI database, we only used a limited data set, so the network structure used in our experiment to discover information from MCI is not necessarily suitable for other data sets.",
    "These ROIs may offer enhanced clinical utility by utilizing information specific to PET signals.",
    "Also, the number of cases in this study appeared not much for a current AI learning, and it is still not enough to generalize our experimental results.",
    "Participants (n \u00bc 109) were evaluated at baseline and in 6-to 12-month intervals following initial evaluation for up to 10 years.",
    "Methods: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET images of 109 patients recruited in the ongoing longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were included in this analysis.",
    "First, a DBN stacked by 3 RBMs was used for feature dimension reduction and recoding like an autoencoder.",
    "We need more indepth research, such as learning the optimal network structure from big data, for a practical application of deep learning in clinical scenarios.",
    "The autoencoder acts as an unsupervised concept extractor for the original data samples.",
    "Young 11 et al proposed building an AD versus NC classifier using a Gaussian process, which was then used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters.",
    "As a comparison, the classification accuracy of the combination of PCA and SVM and AAL and SVM was 79.5% and 63.1%, respectively.",
    "Therefore, only a small amount of a sample can train a good classifier using a DBN, which has obvious advantages in the recognition of a small sample.",
    "These ROIs in the sample series are composed of voxels whose series share some similarity; some regions are homogeneous while some are heterogeneous.",
    "Experiments in the FDG-PET image database of 109 patients provided evidence to support 2 assertions: (1) The proposed method, which uses only features derived from a single FDG-PET modality, can be superior to existing methods that use multimodal features in the sMCI versus pMCI classification task; (2) the proposed network can learn the discriminant mode from the difference ROIs to obtain a more robust classifier with better discriminant performance.",
    "Therefore, the present study aimed to propose a novel framework with a deep neural network based on DBN, which can effectively learn the patterns of metabolic changes between MCI converters and nonconverters using FDG-PET images.",
    "18 The aim of preprocessing was to spatially normalize the images into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.",
    "Hence, 18F-FDG-PET is recognized as a potential tool for presymptomatic diagnosis of AD, offering acceptable sensitivity and accuracy.",
    "Effectively visualizing or interpreting the representation of potential features is a major challenge that needs to be addressed by both machine learning and the clinical neuroscience community.",
    "Each column represents a single sample, and each row represents the same ROI from the regiongrowing algorithm.",
    "For pairwise training between nodes of input layers and hidden layers, a conditional Gaussian distribution is used:\nwhere sig is the logistic function: sig\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1 1\u00fee \u00c0x .",
    "(3) For the classification, we use SVM for classifiers to replace SoftMax in last layer of BP network because SVM has prominent advantages in solving the problem of identifying small samples.",
    "In the classification experiment, using features from the DBN with radial basis, kernel, linear, and polynomial achieved accuracies of 86.6%, 83.9%, and 79.2%, respectively, to distinguish MCI-to-AD converters from stable patients with MCI.",
    "The input of the SVM is the result of feature coding of the original regions ROIs by the DBN.",
    "9 For example, Zhang 10 et al used Multiple Kernel Learning to build a classifier for MCI and normal group (NC), which was further used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters.",
    "We argue, therefore, that the proposed method can be a powerful means to represent neuroimaging biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of AD populations.",
    "The number of PCA eigenvectors was chosen to retain 95% variance, and the feature after dimension reduction was used as the feature input of SVM."
