    "The purpose of the present study was to analyze an international large-scale data set using a cognitive assessment approach.",
    "For an overview of DCMs, the reader is referred to DiBello, Roussos, and Stout (2007) , Fu and Li (2007) , Rupp and Templin (2008a) , and Rupp et al.",
    "The DINA model has been used in analyses of the TIMSS data by several authors, including Lee et al., (2011) and Choi, Lee, and Park (2015) .",
    "Several recent studies (e.g., Dogan & Tatsuoka, 2008; Im & Park, 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Toker & Green, 2012; Lee et al., 2013) have been conducted to compare students' achievements on international large-scale assessments (e.g., TIMSS, PIRLS) using DCMs.",
    "This study showed the application of a CDA-based assessment for a large-scale test data set, which has been originally analyzed with a traditional IRT model (3PL).",
    "All analyses were conducted using an object-oriented software package called OxEdit (Doornik, 2003) in order to obtain DINA model estimations using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.",
    "As Leighton and Gierl (2007) stated, recent CDM studies have been applied for posthoc analyses and item analyses rather than constructing the tests (Chapter 7).",
    "This comparative study attempted to analyze TIMSS data sets for Korea and Turkey using a DINA model in order to present an application of a CDA-based analysis.",
    "Hence, this CDA-based study examines the following research questions:\n1.",
    "This study focused on the DINA model.",
    "The codes for the DINA model were requested from de la Torre (personal communication, February, 2014) .",
    "Since IEA (The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) used 3PL IRT model for TIMSS analyses, results of 3PL IRT model were also provided for two samples before presenting main DINA model results (see Table 5 ).",
    "Using the attribute list in Table 2 , 32 items were coded independently by four doctoral students with advance degrees in mathematics education at one large public university in the Southeast.",
    "Korea (the top performing country) and Turkey (the focus of the study) were selected for analyses in this study to show how a DINA model can be used to obtain fine-grained information about the performances of the students from these two countries.",
    "Assuming that we have enough model-data fit, we can make several conclusions based on DINA model results.",
    "Although some researchers question the relationship between student-level (or country-level) achievement and comparison studies based on such international large-scale assessments (Holliday & Holliday, 2003; Wang, 2001 ), In order to provide an example to show how diagnostic feedback can be given using real data, this study analyzes TIMSS 2011 data from a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA; Leighton & Gierl, 2007) perspective.",
    "Results of the DINA model were used to make a detailed comparison between students of these two countries.",
    "It should be noted that model-data fit and item fit statistics may have an effect on the interpretations of item parameter estimates obtained from a DINA model.",
    "DINA model was used in this study, because the DINA model requires an estimation of two parameters for each item, and the number of attributes does not affect the number of estimated parameters in the DINA model.",
    "Since the first administration of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 1995, the comparison of the relative performances of participating countries has become very helpful for finding out country-level success relative to other countries.",
    "More appropriate conclusions can be made based on models with better fit.",
    "As de la Torre and Lee (2008) showed, the results of the DINA model are consistent with that of the IRT models for the same data.",
    "Fit statistics for DINA model analyses are presented in Table 4 .",
    "The conjunctive kernel of the DINA model can be presented as below:\n, where is the latent variable which is coded as zero or one for respondent r and item i, and is the Q-matrix entry described above.",
    "This is done with the conjunctive kernel of the DINA model, which is presented as a latent response vector ( below (Equation 1).",
    "Although, our study demonstrated that retrofitting of a CDM via the DINA model can be very useful for the TIMSS assessment, it is evident that more benefit can be obtained from CDM-based analyses when tests are designed using CDMs in advance.",
    "Table 6 presents item parameter estimates for slipping, guessing and the discrimination index for both countries.",
    "In the DINA model, these two item parameters are defined as follows: , After defining slipping and guessing parameters, the probability of the correct response of a respondent in latent class c for item i can be computed as below:\nAccording to Equation 4, respondents need to master all attributes measured by an item in order to answer this item correctly.",
    "As shown in Table 6 , Items 4, 24, and 25 (the three with the lowest guessing and slipping parameter estimates) are the most informative items for Korean and Turkish samples.",
    "This study retrofitted the TIMSS 2011 eighth grade mathematics assessment by applying a specific CDM called the DINA (the deterministic, inputs, noisy, \"and\" gate) model to data from South Korea and Turkey.",
    "As stated by Mullis, Martin, Foy, and Arrora (2012) , 42 countries and 14 benchmarking entities participated in TIMSS 2011.",
    "Like most of the CDMs, the DINA model requires a Q-matrix (Tatsuoka, 1985) that shows the relationship among items (i,...,I) and attributes (k,...,K).",
    "It is desirable for a DINA model to have small guessing and slipping parameter estimates for a good model-data fit (Rupp et al., 2010) .",
    "By means of examining the attribute prevalence estimates (see Table 7 ), it was concluded that Turkish students were particularly weak in mastering Attributes 1, 8, and 13 when compared to their Korean peers.",
    "In addition to item parameter estimates, the DINA model provides respondent parameters estimates (attribute probability and attribute prevalence).",
    "As can be seen in Table 6 , Korean students had higher guessing parameter estimates and lower slipping parameter estimates than Turkish students for most of the items.",
    "An attribute was included in our Q-matrix if at least two coders agreed that an item measured that attribute (see Table 3 ).",
    "The administration of Booklet 2 to Korean and Turkish students was selected for the DINA model analyses in this study due to the following reasons: (a) there were relatively more topics-13-in Booklet 2; (b) the subject areas of the items were distributed evenly-nine items for Numbers, nine items for Algebra, seven items for Data and Chance, and seven items for Geometry; and (c) the cognitive domains among the items were also distributed evenly-10 items required knowing, 13 items required applying, and nine items required reasoning.",
    "Korean sample had a higher attribute prevalence than the Turkish sample (see Table 7 ).",
    "Slipping, guessing and discrimination parameter estimates for Korean and Turkish samples are presented in Table 6 .",
    "The mean values for item guessing, slipping parameters and the discrimination index are presented in the last row of Table 4 .",
    "A number of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), also known as diagnostic classification models (DCMs), have been developed (Rupp, Templin, & Henson, 2010) to apply the CDA approach.",
    "General DCMs include the log-linear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM; Henson, Templin, & Willse, 2009) , the general diagnostic model (GDM; von Davier, 2005) , and the generalized DINA (G-DINA; de la Torre, 2011) model.",
    "According to Im and Park (2010) , the results of those studies pointed out that factors contributing to Korean students' high achievement could be grouped under social and instructional factors.",
    "Hence, in comparison to Korean students, as in the Dogan and Tatsuoka (2008) study, Turkish students also did not perform well on the data and chance problems that investigated the chance process and using and evaluating probability models.",
    "Let be the response of examinee r to item i, and let",
    "Similarly, Im and Park (2010)",
    "Under this condition, item parameter estimates from the DINA model can provide feedback for students from the two countries.",
    "For example, Items 6 and 8 yielded higher slipping parameter estimates for both samples.",
    "Therefore, standards from high-performing countries played a significant role in the development of the CCSSM (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2014)."
