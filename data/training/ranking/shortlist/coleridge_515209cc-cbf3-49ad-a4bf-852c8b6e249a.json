    "A relevant review can be found here [35] .",
    "[83] , which is based on Thirion and Calmon [84] , and that by Pieperhoff et al.",
    "A database such as that proposed under recommendation (3) would facilitate such a comparison.",
    "Their study showed not only how well the automated methods performed compared to the average expert segmentations, but importantly it also highlighted the variability between experts, which should be taken into account in setting up a database.",
    "and method-related effects, such comparisons between analysis methods should be performed using the same common dataset(s).",
    "More recently, Durand-Dubief et al.",
    "One of the first uses of the proposed database could be to investigate inter-expert variability, and possibly standardize manual outlining methods in order to improve the validation of automated methods for quantifying lesion volume change and atrophy rates in MS.",
    "Sample size calculations in RRMS showed similar sample sizes were required for BSI and SI-ENA [90] .",
    "(3) A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS.",
    "The method proposed by Ait-Ali et al.",
    "A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS.",
    "The availability of two consecutively acquired MP-RAGE scans provides an opportunity to study the reproducibility of methods [98] , and including similar scan-rescan data in an MS test dataset would be highly desirable.",
    "As indicated in the section on image acquisition, results are also influenced by the choice of imaging parameters, and so tissue contrast and spatial resolution should be optimized.",
    "In order to be able to handle the large volumes of imaging data emanating from large therapeutic trials, it would seem appropriate to strive for further, if not complete, automation.",
    "The OASIS dataset also contains short-term rescan images for reliability analyses.",
    "The database should be accompanied by the framework necessary for carrying out objective and quantitative evaluation of different methods against ''gold standard'' expert annotations, including standards for reporting the results of those comparisons, and thereby facilitate an unbiased and transparent assessment of image analysis methods.",
    "Partly simulated image data in which the true change is known, as used in their study, may also facilitate such developments in MS, especially when based on representative images from MS patients and made widely available as recommended below.",
    "The methods that Llad\u00f3 et al.",
    "[78] highlights the state of the art and remaining challenges for application in a clinical or clinical trial setting.",
    "Therefore, it seems imperative that to make real progress, training data should be made available that captures the variability that is encountered in a real clinical or trial setting, not only the variability due to inter-patient differences, but also that due to the heterogeneity of scanners and imaging protocols.",
    "Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the influence that choice of analysis method has on the results.",
    "These points should prove complementary: the standard test dataset may facilitate development and improvement of the integrated segmentation techniques, which in turn would benefit from the isotropic spatial resolution of the acquisition.",
    "For both these issues, challenges remain, and solving both might be facilitated by the standardized test dataset discussed under recommendation (3).",
    "In contrast, a recent paper on MS demonstrated that, following a standardized imaging protocol and identical longitudinal VBM analysis methods, the differences between centers in the longitudinal VBM changes observed in MS patients are much smaller than the disease-related changes, indicating that pooling of data from different centers may be feasible for longitudinal VBM analysis in MS [94] .",
    "Data collection and analysis methods for longitudinal MR imaging studies of brain lesion load and brain atrophy in MS have proved to be of great value, but can be improved.",
    "One example application is the group-level lesion probability mapping (LPM) approach, which several studies have used cross-sectionally [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , but few so far have used to investigate longitudinal changes [30, 31] .",
    "The MICCAI MS lesion challenge has been mentioned above, and the sustained availability of those data allows further development of MS lesion segmentation methods.",
    "A recent review of the literature on correlative studies between MRI and histopathology in MS [10] recommended improvement of imaging specificity, highresolution image acquisition, and use of combination of imaging methods in longitudinal studies to gain a deeper understanding of the disease processes in MS.\nAgainst this background, this paper focuses on what we consider desirable future developments in image acquisition and analysis for the longitudinal assessment of brain lesions and brain atrophy in MS.",
    "Although the method by Gerig et al.",
    "In order to allow investigators to select an analysis method, based on an unbiased assessment of various alternatives, one possible approach is to create annotated longitudinal MR image datasets from carefully selected and representative MS patients from multiple scanners/ centers.",
    "Although promising results are often reported for images from a single scanner, performance on diverse datasets can be poor due to the different tissue contrasts that may be unknown to the algorithm.",
    "Both this difference between SIENA-R and longitudinal VBM, and the superiority of (within-subject) registration-based techniques may be explained by the design of the methods: analysis methods that analyze within-subject change over time directly, by concurrently analyzing multiple timepoints, make use of the fact that intra-subject variability is generally smaller than inter-subject variability.",
    "Several databases are available that meet some of these requirements.",
    "It was shown for 2D images that the number of changing T2 lesions observed from the beginning to the end of a trial is statistically more powerful than the number of gadoliniumenhancing lesions from monthly scans [80] .",
    "It would therefore be prudent to investigate alternative approaches; such approaches could be informed by a detailed analysis of the errors that occur when applying current methods to data already collected in longitudinal studies of MS.",
    "However, a recent paper showed that a single combination of option settings yielded quantitatively very good results across a range of 3D T1-weighted image types in MS patients [57] , obviating the need for further adjustment.",
    "Improved accuracy and sensitivity will reduce the numbers of patients required to detect a given treatment effect in a trial, and ultimately, will allow reliable characterization of individual patients for personalized treatment.",
    "Therefore, a test dataset should not be restricted to simulated images based on healthy control data, but should also include real patient data.",
    "These scanner effects are important issues in most large-scale studies in MS, and this discrepancy merits further investigation.",
    "It is clear from the discussion of published methods above that far more methods have been developed than just the selection listed in Table 2 that are available for installing locally.",
    "While the ''holy grail'' of a comprehensive segmentation method accessible by all researchers in the field should still be pursued, improvement of existing techniques may be a useful alternative approach.",
    "Optimizing SNR and tissue contrast through choice of field strength, pulse sequence design, and optimization of sequence parameters prior to initiation of a study is imperative.",
    "For all these methods, there are several choices to be made on issues such as the type of registration, whether and how to include prior information on expected lesion and atrophy-related change, among others; these choices should be informed in part by comparing results against expert manual analysis.",
    "For group studies, registration errors due to the presence of severe pathology may be limited by using disease group-specific templates rather than standard healthy control templates, together with appropriate regularization of the registration [55] .",
    "Such concurrent analysis of multiple timepoints for one patient has been implemented in the CLADA software for longitudinal cortical atrophy measurement [50] and in the FreeSurfer software package for cortical thickness measurement and deep GM volumetry [51] , while another paper demonstrated how difference images, obtained by subtracting coregistered images from two timepoints, may be used in the automated quantification of lesion volume change [52] .",
    "This result was perhaps to be expected based on the different mechanisms of the two methods, with VBM quantifying local GM density and its change over time, while SIENA-R measures displacement of the local brain-non-brain boundary.",
    "Table 1 lists these artifacts and possible solutions.",
    "This review includes a table that clearly shows the lack of consistency in quantitative performance metrics used in the literature, clearly illustrating the need for standardized reporting methods.",
    "Finally, the spatial, temporal, and possibly causal relations between brain lesions and brain atrophy [30, 33, 34] , could be studied better if both the atrophy and the lesions were imaged with (near) isotropic spatial resolution of the order of 1 mm.",
    "In order to distinguish between disease-related effects (different disease types, patient selection, follow-up durations, etc.)"
