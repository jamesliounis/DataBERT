    "Annual cotton yield data for each county available from the NASS archive were used as the reference to evaluate GOSSYM simulations.",
    "Th is was done by using 1979 to 2005 mean yields.",
    "Figure 7 compares the spatial frequency distributions of all cotton-grid pointwise relative mean biases, standard deviation ratios, and correlation coeffi cients of the original and redeveloped GOSSYM.",
    "Th e prevailing cultural information on the plant row spacing and density as well as planting and harvest dates are from the Agricultural Statistics Board (1997) and State Cooperative Extension together with published literature.",
    "Th e model formulation, development, and application of GOSSYM have been well documented (Baker et al., 1983; McKinion et al., 1989; Baker and Landivar, 1991; Boone et al., 1995; Hodges et al., 1998; Reddy et al., 1997 Reddy et al., , 2002 .",
    "Both values were derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) archive at the county level.",
    "A companion study (Liang et al., 2012a) fulfi lled the third objective, where spatiotemporal variations of cotton yields and their responses to climate stresses simulated by the redeveloped GOSSYM were compared with observations.",
    "Both models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitude; however, the temporal correspondence between modeled and observed interannual anomalies was much more realistic in the redeveloped than the original GOSSYM because signifi cant (P = 0.05) correlations were identifi ed in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively.",
    "Th e NARR provides a long-term, consistent, high-resolution climate data set that represents the best available proxy of observations.",
    "Figure 3b shows the WP statistics averaged during 1979 to 2005 across the Southwest, Mid-South, and Southeast in terms of varying \u03b1 from 0.1 to 0.9 in increments of 0.05 for N 0 values of 440, 330, and 220 kg ha -1 .",
    "Signifi cant correlations were simulated by the redeveloped and original GOSSYM in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively.",
    "Th e climate conditions driving the standalone GOSSYM simulation were taken from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) (Mesinger et al., 2006) .",
    "Based on the Student t-test and assuming yearly independence, correlation coeffi cients >0.32 are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.",
    "Th e redeveloped GOSSYM generates its peak frequency at 17% when the correlation coeffi cient is 0.65, whereas the original model has its peak value at 16% when the correlation coeffi cient is 0.25.",
    "In the companion study (Liang et al., 2012a) , the redeveloped GOSSYM was used to study the responses of cotton growth to climatic stresses in the U.S. Cotton Belt and thereby to evaluate its ability to reproduce the observed cotton-climate relationships.",
    "Th us, these climate and crop models need to be coupled to better understand the interactions between regional climates, ecosystems, and agricultural crops (Tsvetsinskaya et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Osborne et al., 2009) .",
    "Missing records in this database were replaced with regional averages reported by the USDA (Potter et al., 2006, Table 34 ).",
    "When the experimental long-term standard deviations were compared with observations, CNTL (Fig.",
    "A similar experiment using the original GOSSYM was conducted in this study to simulate cotton yield distributions across the entire U.S. Cotton Belt during 1979 to 2005 under more realistic conditions that include observed CO 2 concentrations and climate variations, fertilizer application rates, and irrigation area percentages (all distributed on the CWRF 30-km grid), as well as state-specifi c planting and harvest dates.",
    "Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the geographic distribution of the USGS categories identifi ed as the dominant type (Table 1) in each CWRF 30-km grid and the USDA county-level harvested cotton acreage averaged during 1979 to 2005.",
    "Th e result shows that the redeveloped GOSSYM realistically reproduces the geographic distribution of mean cotton yields in 30-km grids, within \u00b110% of observations across most of the U.S. Cotton Belt, whereas the original GOSSYM overestimated yields by 27 to 135% at the state level and 92% overall.",
    "Model evaluation, while critical, has been limited and most oft en subjective, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive observations and coupled predictive systems (Th orp et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2008) .",
    "Th ese two parameters were validated indirectly by comparing the model total irrigated water amounts with U.S. statewide observations.",
    "Th e inverse modeling or optimization algorithm is well accepted and widely used in calibrations of crop growth models (Liu et al., 1989; Jones and Carberry, 1994; Calmon et al., 1999; Irmak et al., 2000; Gauch et al., 2003; Th orp et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2008) .",
    "Th is study, the fi rst in a series, addressed the fi rst and second objectives, with a focus on model development, including soft ware reengineering, physics improvement, and parameter determination.",
    "Th ey used the original GOSSYM, however, as a \"black box\" model (i.e., without the modifi cations outlined above) and did not provide a direct model validation as driven by realistic surface and climatic conditions.",
    "Figure 3a depicts the NP statistics averaged for 1979 to 2005 over the Southwest, Mid-South, and Southeast regions in terms of varying N 0 from 110 to 440 kg ha -1 (in increments of 27.5 kg ha -1 ) for \u03b1 values of 0.05, 0.50, and 1.00.",
    "(1989) derived the phenological coeffi cients for maize (Zea mays L.) through inverse modeling by closely matching the CERES-maize Th e use of this optimization in the current study required a large ensemble of GOSSYM standalone simulations.",
    "Th e interactive GOSSYM, as coupled with the CWRF model, can be used in future studies to provide more credible and detailed depictions of cottonclimate interactions.",
    "Th us, all current global and regional climate models incorporate comprehensive land surface models to predict surface-atmosphere exchanges of energy, momentum, water, and other mass constituents (Dickinson et al., 1993; Sellers et al., 1996; Dai et al., 2003) .",
    "Th e redeveloped GOSSYM has a peak frequency of 40% at the relative mean bias of -0.05, while the peak frequency of the original model is 7.5% at the relative mean bias of 1.05.",
    "Th ere are, however, no credible data to specify them correctly.",
    "For the relative mean bias, the occurrence of a larger frequency closer to 0.0 on the horizontal axis indicates that the model simulates more grids with smaller errors relative to observations, and hence is more realistic.",
    "When this information was not explicitly recorded, the irrigated area of cotton was estimated using the NASS Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) Census of Agriculture from 1984 from , 1988 from , 1994 from , 1998 from , and 2003 from .",
    "State-level data for annual N fertilizer rates (per fertilized cotton acre receiving N) during 1964 to 2005 are archived at the USDA Economic Research Service.",
    "Th ey diff er among the states (Table 2) .",
    "We fi rst acquired the USDA data archive to defi ne where and when cotton grows and whether it is irrigated.",
    "Th us, the two models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitudes.",
    "As such, the CSSP, which is most relevant to the coupling with GOSSYM in the present study, has outperformed major land surface models in predicting soil temperature and moisture distributions, terrestrial hydrology variations, and land-atmosphere exchanges (Yuan and Liang, 2011a) .",
    "A more important capability in modeling variability is the temporal correspondence between GOSSYM and observed anomalies from 1 yr to another.",
    "Inclusion of the above improvements and optimizations in the redeveloped GOSSYM produced good agreement with observations, where simulated 1979 to 2005 mean yields were within \u00b110% of observed values across almost the entire U.S. Cotton Belt.",
    "It predicts 11 layers of soil temperature and moisture (liquid or ice), fi ve layers of snow (mass, cover, and age), and a two-leaf (sunlit or shaded) canopy of temperature, radiation, and photosynthesis-stomatal resistance (Dai et al., 2003 (Dai et al., , 2004 .",
    "Th is can be measured by correlating the time series.",
    "Th e standard deviation ( Fig.",
    "Th e results showed that simulated annual irrigated water amounts were in good agreement with the FRIS data in the Southwest and Mid-South during the survey years.",
    "We developed a geographically distributed cotton growth model from the original GOSSYM and optimized it for coupling with the regional Climate-Weather Research Forecasting model (CWRF).",
    "Our strategy was to estimate both parameters through inverse modeling by optimization that minimizes local root mean square errors (RMSEs) of annual cotton yields simulated from observations during 1979 to 2005.",
    "Data analysis showed that the existing automatic irrigation scheme, based only on the static ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration under a fi xed water stress threshold (e.g., Hillel and Guron, 1973; Fischbach and Somerholder, 1974) , was likely to be the major cause for this overestimation.",
    "Th is was accomplished via inverse modeling to determine the irrigation ratio and initial NO 3 values that minimized model biases of observed yields, averaged across the entire integration period at each CWRF grid."
