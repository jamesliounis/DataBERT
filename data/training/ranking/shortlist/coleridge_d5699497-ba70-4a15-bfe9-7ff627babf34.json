    "Based on this dataset, the TCs composited by their intensification rate and environmental wind shear were analyzed to compare microwave signatures during different intensity regimes [66] .",
    "The HURSAT-microwave consists of data from the SSM/I platforms between 1987 and 2009, using global best track data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) to search for TCs [24] .",
    "A more advanced TC PMW TB database at 1 km spatial resolution has been developed at NRL-MRY from all available PMW sensors in 1987-2012 with more consistent inter-calibrated TBs at 89 GHz, better eye fixing, and high quality interpolation scheme [68, 69] .",
    "For example, a recent study indicates that introduction of the ATMS data into the HWRF system has significant impacts on forecasts of hurricane intensity and track [103] .",
    "The microwave data interpolated onto an 8-km grid in the hurricane satellite (HURSAT) archive was created in 2008 [65] .",
    "A statistical analysis of the distribution of temperatures with respect to TC axisymmetry (the deviation angle variance technique) continues to show great promise in not only diagnosing structure, but also helping with TC centering, genesis, and intensity [29] .",
    "Section 8 presents a brief summary of history, applications, and impacts of satellite remote sensing on TC structure, intensity, forecast, and monitoring.",
    "Some efforts focused on cataloging TCs through an extended climatology of microwave imagers.",
    "Other studies also revealed relationship between microwave imager data to TC intensity [62, 63] .",
    "A good review of TC rainfall's structure, intensity, and forecasts was recently reported [21] .",
    "Recently, a new study on eyewall size estimates using the HURSAT-microwave data compared to the aircraft reconnaissance measurements demonstrates the similarity of in-situ and satellitederived structural profiles [67] .",
    "Proper utilization of satellite data with positive impacts on forecast skills still requires more investigations and validations.",
    "Dvorak developed an empirical model to diagnose TC intensity based on cloud organization in the visible channel.",
    "It is still the most common method to diagnose TC intensity, with further attempts at intensity analysis heavily borrowing for this work's legacy.",
    "Use of AMSU data as part of an ensemble shows great promise for more accurate TC structure retrieval; a combination of the ADT and two different AMSU intensity estimates makes up the satellite consensus (SATCON) method of TC intensity estimation [57] , which has the highest skill of all satellite-based intensity estimation methods [58] .",
    "Therefore, this multisensor-panel imagery can be applied for better analysis of these important TC characteristics such as eyewall development, formation of concentric eyewall, convective zones and cells, rain band formation, central dense overcast, shear, and low-level center.",
    "The high-resolution airborne Doppler radar was recently used to update and extend these results [48, 49] .",
    "Efforts to make the process more objective led to the creation of a fully automated TC intensity analysis [25] , which itself continues to have updates as the Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) [26] .",
    "This kind of multi-panel display is used for a better analysis of the TC intensity, position, and structure.",
    "Similar studies were done to create a QuikSCAT climatology of storm sizes for the 34-kt radius and outer-core strength (OCS) intensity [34] [35] [36] .",
    "Thus, a high spatial resolution is required in making accurate TC simulations and predictions.",
    "Determining the TC's center position was the only reliably produced operational use of TC satellite analysis until the influential work of Dvorak [22] in 1972.",
    "Results indicate that SATCON performs well against the TC's best track dataset.",
    "The application and customization of Dvorak analysis worldwide described in [23] help demonstrate its versatility and robustness as a tool for TC forecasting.",
    "A flowchart of rules in the Dvorak method was created to consistently generate subjective estimates of TC intensity from the structural cues in satellite imagery.",
    "Results show a reduced bias of TC track for CRTL2 than CRTL1 so that impacts of the polar-orbital satellite data on TC track are further validated.",
    "To contrast, microwave imagers have a more recent appearance in TC analysis, with perhaps more potential for added value.",
    "Figure 13 presents the combined comparison results on track errors and standard deviations of the four TC forecasts between CRTL2 and CRTL2 + ATMS.",
    "Figure 7 presents the AMSU-retrieved temperature anomaly distributions at 4000 ft at different stages of Hurricane Rita during 18-21 September, 2015.",
    "It can provide additional information of the TC cloud patterns important to TC's overall structure and organization, especially for a potential low-level circulation center.",
    "The role of satellite observations in NWP forecast skills is normally assessed by the observing system experiments (OSEs) in which denying or adding a set of satellite data is applied from or to a baseline observing system in order to show its impacts on the forecast skills [96] [97] [98] .",
    "These features include a TB depression at the high frequency channel (85, 89 or 91 GHz) due to ice scattering and lower frequencies such as 37 GHz principally showing liquid hydrometeor emissions near and below the freezing level.",
    "This methodology leverages information in each channel (due to the weighting function representing different altitudes and chemical profiles) to emphasize specific structural features such as overshooting convective tops.",
    "A recent study based on TRMM rain datasets for landfall TCs over different parts of China presents various rainfall patterns relative to TC's motion at different times of landfall [79] .",
    "Section 2 discusses TC detections from satellite observations, while Sections 3 and 4 describe analysis of TC structure and intensity with satellite remote sensing.",
    "This image uses the model output from the ECMWF experiments, showing where Sandy was predicted to be located 5-days out with the normal satellite data inputs into the model (left) and without any polar-orbiting satellite data (right).",
    "The upper-left panel is the GOES IR image, while the upper-right panel is the enhanced IR image (VIS imagery is used in daytime when it is available) with the Dvorak method for improved TC analysis.",
    "Soon after the first satellite weather observations became available, routine TC intensity studies from this imagery began [23] .",
    "It clearly proves that the storm's intensity and position were accurate with the LEO satellite data, while its intensity would be weak and its position offshore without satellite data assimilations.",
    "It shows different characteristics depending on what matric is applied.",
    "The assimilation of additional ATMS data further reduced the bias of TC tracks and intensity as well as increased its lead time of forecasting.",
    "Results show that PHRaM is improved significantly compared with the standard R-CLIPER.",
    "Future efforts on optimum selections of the combined satellite sensor channels which have positive impacts and better data assimilation methods are necessary in addition to improvements in the next generation NWP models and developments as well as future advanced satellite sensors onboard adequate satellites for better spatial and temporal global coverage.",
    "A more detailed discussion about the utility of microwave imagers indicated that despite the ability to create the PMW-derived physical quantities (e.g., sea surface wind magnitude, precipitable water, and cloud liquid water) using multiple frequencies which utilize different spatial resolutions, they smooth over important structural features of the TC [59] .",
    "It clearly shows evaluations of TC's key characteristics for purposes of a global TC monitoring and tracking.",
    "QuikSCAT scatterometer data were used to derive climatology of storm sizes at the 23 kt radius as well as an outer radius using a wind structure model [33] .",
    "The error trends of the TC's track forecasts have been consistently and significantly reduced in last few decades, while improvements on error trends of the TC's intensity forecasts are not so great [100] .",
    "The widely used analysis method for satellite remote sensing of TC is called the Dvorak technique [22] .",
    "Therefore, the TC intensity forecast skill has improved slightly; however, these improvements are still statistically significant [101, 102] .",
    "This conical scan pattern of PMW measurements provides for a consistent spatial resolution which is crucial in analysis of TC detection, intensity, structure, and monitoring [9, 10] ."
