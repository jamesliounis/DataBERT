    "The authors may be contacted at agrover1@ifc.org.",
    "The questions in the survey were drawn from previous surveys of TPOs conducted by the The number of employees in TPOs also varies significantly across countries.",
    "Several key findings emerge from the survey.",
    "Figure   15 provides the share of TPOs that answer that the corresponding virtual program had the largest number of applicants, or the largest expenditure share.",
    "The survey also asked TPOs which were the virtual programs with the largest shares of applications, and which represented the largest expenditure share during COVID.",
    "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
    "Figure 16 shows how the largest number of applications by virtual program varied across TPOs in the four income groups.",
    "Surveys of firms around the world, namely the World Bank's Business Pulse Surveys, documented their responses to the COVID shock including their access to and use of government support programs (e.g., Constantinescu et al., 2022; Cirera et al., 2021) .",
    "\u2022 Help desks Figure 14 displays the shares of TPOs that have adopted each of these virtual tools during COVID, as well as the shares that are planning to continue to use them post COVID.",
    "So the evolution observed on aggregate (described above) was not common across income groups, but explained by the decline in budget in low-income countries in 2020, and the increase in budget in high-income countries in 2021.",
    "This paper is a product of the Development Research Group, Development Economics and the Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice.",
    "A 2021-22 survey of trade promotion organizations conducted by the World Bank to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their functioning suggests four main findings.",
    "Although the export promotion literature has shown that a focus on small exporters may generate higher returns (Volpe Martincus and Carballo, 2010).",
    "Considering the critiques of the earlier literature (Hogan et al., 1991) that TPOs' inefficiencies in the 1980s were explained by the fact that they were not sufficiently funded and too bureaucratic, these numbers suggest that TPOs in high-income countries may have overcome these problems to a larger extent than TPOs in low-income countries.",
    "The bottom panel of Figure 14 provides the same information by income group.",
    "There is also evidence that TPOs have been successful in helping exporters weather the drop in exports during the global recession in 2009 (Biesebroek and Volpe Martincus, 2016) .",
    "To explore this, we correlated changes in total government expenditure (using IMF data) with changes in TPO budgets and found a small positive coefficient, but that is not statistically significant, suggesting that this may not be the main rationale behind changes in TPO budgets during the pandemic.",
    "Note that these two observations could be related as a broader mandate may require a more hierarchical structure.",
    "Since marketing activities are the largest expenditure item of TPOs and also the only one with a significant shift in expenditure shares between 2019 and 2021, Figure 9 provides in the lower panel the distribution of expenditure shares on marketing activities by income group.",
    "It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world.",
    "To address this gap, the World Bank implemented a survey of TPOs in 57 countries between fall 2021 and spring 2022 with the objective of better understanding their responses to a crisis such as the COVID pandemic as well as their functioning more broadly.",
    "We divide our sample into four groups: high-income countries (17 TPOs), upper-middle-income countries (20 TPOs), lower-middle-income countries (11 TPOs) and low-income countries (9 TPOs).",
    "Section 2 describes the sample that responded to the TPO survey.",
    "Non-exporters face higher information barriers, and the literature has shown that this is an important margin on which TPO programs can exhibit high returns (Lederman et al., 2016) .",
    "where for each virtual activity more than 20 percent of TPOs reported it as having the largest number of applicants.",
    "The increase in the use of virtual tools post COVID is mainly driven by TPOs in low-and middle-income countries, as TPOs in high-income countries are expecting to only marginally increase their already high use of virtual tools.",
    "TPOs whether they adopted different virtual tools during the pandemic, and whether they were planning to continue to use these new virtual tools post COVID.",
    "The median TPO budget in high-income countries is 20 times larger than the median TPO budget in low-income countries, and the number of employees in TPOs in high-income countries is 11 times larger, and these differences remain large after controlling for export size.",
    "One may be tempted to speculate that because TPOs in high-income countries adopt a certain strategy or structure, this is likely to be more efficient, or perhaps draw policy recommendations for low-income countries from observed differences in the structure and responses of highincome countries.",
    "This is outside the scope of this paper, but is part of the research agenda of the World Bank.",
    "Combining the information on budgets and number of employees, we find that the differences across TPOs in terms of budget per employee are large but not as striking.",
    "Interestingly, one of the most popular virtual tools used during the pandemic in both high-and low-income countries was \"Training on e-commerce\" (as popular as \"B2B matching events\").",
    "The existing literature has shown that returns to export promotion are higher along the extensive margins, rather than the intensive margin (Volpe Martincus and Carballo, 2008) .",
    "But part of it reflects the changes implemented by TPOs during this period.",
    "We focus here on the comparison of TPOs in high-and low-income countries where differences are more striking.",
    "In high-and upper-middle-income countries, the decline was not as pronounced probably due to a more extensive use of virtual tools to replace inperson marketing activities.",
    "Middle-income countries tend to have a range of adoption of virtual tools in between the range for high and low-income countries.",
    "The largest number of firm applications were observed in these three virtual activities.",
    "This suggests that there was a strong demand for e-commerce training during COVID, and that this does not require large expenditures.",
    "These two observations put together may be explained by the fact that a broader mandate may require a more hierarchical structure.",
    "Second, they help us understand the responses of TPOs during the pandemic and how differences in budget can help explain how TPOs adapted.",
    "Finally, they provide a first look at what the post-COVID TPO world may look like, with virtual tools being more prominent.",
    "This is because high-income countries tend to have larger budgets but also a significantly larger number of employees.",
    "This was also the virtual program with one of the lowest expenditure shares, suggesting such programs are not only popular, but also relatively cheap.",
    "This could partly reflect the finding that TPOs in high-income countries tend to have broader mandates whereas TPOs in low-income countries mainly focus on export promotion.",
    "A potential explanation for these trends is differences in fiscal space.",
    "The largest number of applicants is observed for Trade Fairs, B2B matching events, and Training on e-commerce,",
    "Note that the median TPO had a stable budget over the period as discussed above, so this implies that expenditure on research also marginally increased.",
    "All budgets were converted from local currency to USD using a PPP adjusted exchange rate.3 Note that TPO budget differences between high-and low-income countries when controlling for export value are smaller, but the median TPO budget-to-export ratio is still twice as large for high income countries.",
    "First, there is significant heterogeneity in TPOs' size in terms of budget: the budget of the median TPO in high-income countries is 20 times larger than that of the median TPO in low-income countries."
