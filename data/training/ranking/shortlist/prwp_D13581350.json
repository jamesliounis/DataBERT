    "For advertising we employ the 1982, 1987, and 1992 input-output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).",
    "We subsequently employed the Chow test to test for the equality of coe\u00a2 cients across the two subsamples in (15) , (18) , (20) , and (21) .",
    "Table 1 presents the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of equations (15) and (18) , along with the values of the ordinary and adjusted R 2 statistics.",
    "We have employed in \u2021uence diagnostic techniques to identify observations that could be considered as outliers with respect to the true underlying regression model or observations that exert a strong in \u2021uence on the position of the \u2026tted regression.",
    "3 The paper's empirical \u2026ndings are robust to reasonable changes in model speci\u2026cation as well as to variations in the measures of \u2026rm size dispersion and sunk costs.",
    "We supplement the advertising data from input-output tables with data from Schonfeld & Associates.",
    "A comparison of (2), (14) , and (15) indicates the following relationships between the estimating coe\u00a2 cients and the parameters of the model:",
    "For example, for the 1982 cross section with A=S included in the right-hand side of (15), the Chow F = :21 < F :95 4;242 = 2:41; and the probability level at which the F-test rejects the equality of coe\u00a2 cients across the two sub-samples is .93; similarly, in (18) the Chow F = :33 < F :95 4;242 = 2:41; and the probability level at which the F-test rejects the equality of coe\u00a2 cients is .85.",
    "12 Table 2 presents estimates of (15) and (18) using the pooled data from the 1982, 1987, and 1992 censuses.",
    "More recently, there have been several empirical tests of Gibrat's law based on diverse data sets and employing careful statistical techniques.",
    "8 We also \u2026nd highly statistically signi\u2026cant relationships in the 1987 and 1992 cross-sections.",
    "18 The main focus of this paper has been to assess the impact of tangible sunk costs on \u2026rm size dispersion.",
    "For 1982, we obtain the following parameter estimates (standard errors in parentheses): Thus, we again \u2026nd that there is a statistically signi\u2026cant relationship between the variables determining sunkenness and \u2026rm size dispersion.",
    "The parametric restrictions that are implied by the model are con\u2026rmed by these data.",
    "The likelihood ratio test indicates that the maintained hypothesis H 01 : b 1 = b 2 is not rejected at the 5 percent level in all three temporal cross-sections (1982, 1987, and 1992 1;426 = 3:86 and the probabality level at which a standard F-test rejects the restriction is .78; for 1992, F = :18 < F :95",
    "6 In the presence of serial correlation, FGLS is preferred because it is more e\u00a2 cient and its test statistics are at least asymptotically valid.",
    "Both OLS and the asymptotically more e\u00a2 cient 1 2 For the 1982 cross-section, F = :07 < F :95",
    "2 Previous 0 This paper-a product of the Environment and Energy Team of the Development Research Group-is also being published in the Review of Industrial Organization.",
    "In a recent paper,Cabral and Ross (2008) question the received wisdom that sunk costs create a barrier to entry.",
    "In fact, if there is any relationship at all, it suggests that a larger percentage of \u2026rms in very concentrated industries use more frequently accelerated depreciation in comparison to \u2026rms in unconcentrated industries, pointing to a probable positive correlation between concentration and depreciation.",
    "These \u2026ndings are robust to alternative measures of \u2026rm size dispersion, the time period chosen, estimation procedures, and functional speci\u2026cation.",
    "We employ industry-level data to construct meaningful proxies for sunkenness and thus directly to quantify contestability.",
    "13 However, the test derived by Wooldridge (2002) , suggests that the null hypothesis of no \u2026rstorder autocorrelation is rejected in favor of AR(1).",
    "Moreover, the parametric restrictions implied by the model are not rejected by these data, which provides a measure of con\u2026dence in the model and the measure of sunkenness proposed in (8) .",
    "empirical studies have focused on the technological explanation of concentration, underscoring the signi\u2026cance of the cost curve (especially the minimum e\u00a2 cient scale of production) and barriers to entry by new \u2026rms (Davies and Lyons, 1982) .",
    "This paper seeks to provide a new, economic explanation for the observed interindustry di\u00a4erences in the size distribution of \u2026rms.",
    "For each four-digit industry, the Census also reports the values of the truncated Her\u2026ndahl index H, representing the sum of squared market shares of the largest 50 \u2026rms in the industry or the entire universe, whichever is lower.",
    "Separate regressions were estimated for the census years 1982, 1987, and 1992.",
    "( pooled 1982, 1987, and 1992 data) Equation 15: Equation 18: In assessing the impact of intangible sunk costs on \u2026rm size dispersion, we limit our attention to advertising.",
    "which again is intuitively appealing because it distinguishes two aspects of the single summary measure H i of concentration: fewness, represented by N i , and size disper-",
    "The evidence that is presented in this paper indicates that increased market contestability, as signi\u2026ed by low sunk costs, tends to reduce the dispersion of \u2026rm sizes.",
    "For example, in Table 3 , when advertising is omitted from (20) and 21 Table 3 reveals that the e\u00a4ects of REN i , DEP i , and RES i are more pronounced when advertising sunk costs are taken into account.",
    "Table 3 presents the nonlinear least squares estimates of the parameters in equations (20) and (21) .",
    "1 4 When we apply the Wooldridge test on (18) we obtain F = 57:31 and P rob > F = 0:00.",
    "When we do \u2026nd a di\u00a4erence, it appears that the statistical signi\u2026cance and quantitative importance of the variables that determine tangible sunk costs are actually enhanced when intangible sunk costs are taken into account.",
    "This paper departs from mainstream practice by focusing on the observed inter-industry di\u00a4erences in the dispersion of \u2026rm sizes-the variance equivalent component of concentration.",
    "1;425 = 3:86, and the probabality level at which a standard F-test rejects the restriction is .62. feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were employed.",
    "7 These results are available from the authors upon request.",
    "The higher is the rate of entry, the smaller are size inequalities (Simon and Bonini, 1958; Davies and Lyons, 1982) .",
    "1 There is a vast theoretical and empirical literature on market structure and its various elements such as the 4-\u2026rm concentration ratios.",
    "A comparison of (14) and (18) indicates that with respect to (18) the hypothesis of interest is:",
    "16 1 3 We perform the Bickel (1978) version of the Breusch-Pagan test on (18) .",
    "This ranking of sunkenness is available from the authors upon request.",
    "\"5 It is important to note that even in the single-product case and with a U-shaped average cost, the optimal solution will not always involve equal outputs by all \u2026rms.Baumol and Fischer (1978), andBaumol et al.",
    "We regress the squared residuals on powers of the predictions: for = 5; F =1:03 and P rob > F = :39: Thus for = 5, the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity cannot be rejected at the 5% level.",
    "3 The \u2026nding that sunk costs in \u2021uence the size distribution of \u2026rms is also consistent with the predictions of the Stackelberg-Spence-Dixit model of entry deterrence."
