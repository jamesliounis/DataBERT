    "The statistical comparison in this report were based cm the t statistic.",
    "Occupational data were recoded using the Duncan SEI scale as used in HS&B.",
    "The statistics in this report are population estimates derived from the sample described in the preceding section.",
    "All comparison cited in the text were made using Students' t tests.",
    "Sometims the data in the tables or figures are stucknt-reported information and the soume of data reported for these numbers is the student survey only.",
    "Race Also was constructed from several soirees of info:mat:kw The first source was the student selfreport (item 31A).",
    "B   includes standard errors and sample sizes for the sures and tables presented   :4   t   the rep= The data presenwd in this repwt are from both the stucknt and teacher surveys.",
    "Chapter I discusses the purpose and format of the report and limitations of the study.",
    "Since the student is the unit of analysis and the teacher data wae merpd with the students', the soume of data for these tables and figures is repwted as being from both the sturkat and teacher surveys.",
    "The following classification variables were used in this repon.",
    "Interested readers can compute the t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables using the following formula: Pl.P2 SQRT (set * sel + se2 * se2) where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se2 are their conespcmding standard arms.",
    "However, the majority ce the tables and figures present teacher-reported data and the table or figure titles make this ckar.",
    "In dr NELS:88 data, for instance, it is clear that the highest achieving students in mathematics study algebra with the greatest intensity.",
    "This method corrects de significance (cr alpha) level fin-de total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable.",
    "At the cmcluskm of the report, a summary chapter (chapter 5) reviews dm major findings awl the policy implications.",
    "The rust four components from tim stmknt data are the same as the components used from parent data (in other words, edwation-level data, items 34A and 348, similarly recoded; occupation' data, items 4B and 7B of stolent questionnaire part ow, also recoded).",
    "First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics may appear to merit special attention.",
    "Given time limitations, users of NELS:88 data should exercise caudal in interpreting findings kr certain groups.",
    "In this analysis, data from both the student and the teacher components of the survey were used.",
    "A preface lists highlighted findings, tables, and figures included in the document.",
    "This is somewhat misleading, since the size of the t statistic depends not only on de observed differences in means or percentage being compared but also on the number of respondents in tie categories used fox conparison, and on the degree of variability among respondents within categcries.",
    "Using the standanlized formula score in this report, we know that the mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10, thus we consider any difference in effect sizes of 3 points or more (.3 of a standard deviation) to be stanAically and practically significant",
    "To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrast was used.",
    "While many contrasts will be statistically significant given the large sample sizes, cally a few may reach practical significance.",
    "The data were merged together making the student the unit of analysis.",
    "Generally, whether de statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value fct the diffaence between a pa:7 of means or Foportions and corn g this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels.",
    "The standard errors were calculated using the STRATTAB pnagram, which uses a Taylor series approximation to calculate standard ernrs based upon complex survey designs.48 A version of this program is available from NCFS upon request The standard errors repcced take into account the clustering in the sampling procedure; they are generally higher than standard errors calculated under the assumptions of simple random sampling.",
    "The relationships presented are bivariate association umuljusted statistically for covariates.",
    "Only differences that are statistically and practically significant (see appendix A for a more detailed discussion of the method) are discussed in the text.29 Using this method, differences of about three or more pcdnts in scores are ccmaidered of practical significance, if the difference is statistically significant.",
    "Tin weights used to calculate the estimates were consumed in a fashion that compensawd fo instrument Weighting miceduzes axe explained in the NELS:88 Base Year Student User's Afamial.",
    "Most of these variables were taken directly from the student data file.",
    "Group differences were apparent in levels of participation in science experiments (table 2.3).",
    "(The alpha statistic for each scale is shown in the Science experiments and equipment # Science Experiments (BYT2_26 --how often students conduct experiments) 1=None or .cone/mo (collapsed codes 4-5) 2=About one/mo( code 3) 3=About orie/wk (code 2) 4=About one/dy (code 1) Amount of science equipment (BY12_28 -Amount of science mem fix use) 1 1-2 pupils (collapsed codes 1-2) 2=Groups 3 or mon 3=Littk to now Comlition of equipnent (BYT2_29 -Coxlitioi of science equipment used) 1=Good to excellent (collapsed codes 1-2) 2=Fair",
    "In addition, the NELS:88 data used Imre are fron the base year survey of an ongoing longitudinal study, and, thus, are only cmss-sectkmal.",
    "See appendix A for a more detailed &scission.",
    "If this source was missing or not available, then the sex variable from school rosters was used.",
    "McKnight, et al., 1987. science, however, there is less concentration in any one area.",
    "In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics, a number of issues must be kept in mind.",
    "21bu 3McKnight, C., Crosswhite, F., Dossey, J., Kifer, E., Swafion, J., Travers, K. and Cooney, T., The",
    "This oversampling was sponsored by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA).",
    "H. Braddock, \"Tracking the Middle Gmcks: National Patterns of Gmuping for Instruction,\" Phi Delta Kappan, Febniary 1990,445-449.",
    "Fix example, in a recent report, it was maintained that students in compensatory and remedial programs received instruction in smaller groups or classes and spent large amounts of time engaged in seat work activities.36 33The sample of smdents in science classes with either 1 to 15 pupils ix in classes with mat than 30 students was too snail to find a statistically significant difference between the average scores of students in classes of these sizes.",
    "Tin table below shows the scales created and the input variables for each.",
    "The stucknt data were used to construct SES if all comments based on parent data were missing and at least one component based on student data was not missing.",
    "A small difference =pared across a large number of respondents could result in a large t statistic.",
    "This composite is a scale that included such questions as wixther students placed a high pricaity an learning, whether teachers encouraged students to do their best, whether students were expected to do homework, and whetha they faced competition for grades.",
    "However, the nature of the error depends upon the sample design, and the error properties of many types of sample designs (including two-stage designs such as the one used in this stixly) are known.",
    "The use of effect size allows one to compare mean differegzes among group even when the tests are on different scales.",
    "Boiferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons were made where appropriate.",
    "Standard errors for the estimates in each of the tables are presented in the appendix."
