    "Demographic details of these cohorts are provided in Table 1 .",
    "This result accords with several previously reported studies [16, 18, 21] .",
    "PVC and adoption of white matter as reference led to a considerably smaller estimated sample size needed to achieve an 80% power and two-sided type-I error of p = 0.05 to detect a reduced rate of amyloid accumulation in hypothetical anti-amyloid therapy trials.",
    "The estimated sample sizes for anti-amyloid therapy trials were smaller based on LC_Dyn data compared to the LC and the observed longitudinal MCSUVR change had smaller p values and larger effect size (Table 6 vs. Table 4 ).",
    "The sample size calculation was performed using MATLAB (R2015b) (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) function: sampsizepwr, in the statistics and machine learning toolbox v10.1.",
    "In comparison, in this current study in the DIAN cohort using PiB as the tracer, we observed a substantially larger annual rate of 0.02\u00b10.03 in SUVR in a cohort that is a mixture of MCI (CDR = 0.5) and asymptomatic participants using similar reference region.",
    "PVC and using white matter as reference region also led to larger effect size (Table 4 ).",
    "Cross-sectional and longitudinal [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed.",
    "A cross-sectional cohort (CC) was selected from the Washington University in St. Louis (WU) site DIAN cohort, including 69 participants (38 mutation carriers) with valid baseline PiB scans on the same PET scanner.",
    "Here, we investigate the impact of 1) reference region selection; 2) correction for partial volume effects; and 3) choice of quantification technique using cross-sectional and longitudinal [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) imaging data from the DIAN study.",

    "More recently, Brendel et al.",
    "Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YS AZS DSM.",
    "The analysis performed in this study is based on the DIAN cohort using PiB as the imaging tracer.",
    "Analyzed the data: YS TMB CJO JJC KF NJM QW AZS KC EMR CX.",
    "[17] , was approximated by combining corpus callosum and the ROI labelled as \"UnsegmentedWhiteMatter\" by FreeSurfer.",
    "PVC based analysis generated significantly (p<0.0005) larger longitudinal percent change in MCSUVR regardless of the reference regions used ( Table 4 ).",
    "The difference in annual rate of change and similarity of estimated sample size is likely a combined effects of cohorts, tracer, and quantification methods, and further investigation is necessary.",
    "These criteria include low inter-subject variability in reference regions [15, 22] , strong group differences between control subjects and AD patients [15, 16, 22] , and, in longitudinal studies, strong longitudinal changes [16, 17, 25] .",
    "The MCSUVR change from baseline to follow-up had the smallest p values with (p = 0.0000075) and without (p = 0.000017) PVC when core white matter was used as the reference.",
    "Improved statistical power with full dynamic scanning likely is attributable to greater consistency in the selection of the time window used for quantification.",
    "White matter referencing, MC_CW = mean cortical region SUVR using core white matter as reference; MC_TW = mean cortical region SUVR using total white matter as reference; MCRSF_CER = mean cortical region SUVR using cerebellar cortex as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_BS = mean cortical region SUVR using brainstem as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_CW = mean cortical region SUVR using core white matter as reference with RSF partial volume correction; MCRSF_TW = mean cortical region SUVR using total white matter as reference with RSF partial volume correction; delta = change in SUVR from baseline to follow-up; delta% = percent change in SUVR from baseline to follow-up; p is the strength of the difference between follow-up and baseline SUVRs based on a paired t-test; Rate = the annual rate of SUVR change; sample size is the estimated number of participants per arm needed to detect a 25% or a 50% reduction in amyloid accumulation rate due to treatment with 80% power and a two-tailed type-I error of p = 0.05 in a 12-month placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.",
    "It is observed that cerebellar cortex referencing led to the smallest test-retest variability ( Table 5) , while the other reference regions did not differ significantly.",
    "[16] using white matter as reference region based on the same dataset.",
    "This technique depends on segmentation of high resolution structural MR data.",
    "TOF-MRA data was acquired with during the same imaging session as the T1-weighted structural scan for the AQ cohort.",
    "PVC emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences.",
    "And it appears that the inter-individual variability was larger when cerebellar cortex was used as reference than when white matter were used as reference.",
    "A large white matter region of interest (ROI) has been proposed as an reference region to provide improved discrimination between clinically defined groups [16] ; and a smaller \"core\" white matter reference region was reported to improve the detection of changes in tracer retention in longitudinal studies within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [ 18 F]florbetapir data [17] .",
    "This trade-off should be carefully evaluated at study design.",
    "Follow-up MCSUVRs were compared with their corresponding baseline measurements using paired t-test.",
    "In addition, we also estimated the number of participants per arm needed to detect a 25% and 50% reduction in amyloid accumulation rate due to treatment with 80% power and a two-tailed type-I error of p = 0.05 in a 12-month placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.",
    "SUV values were calculated for the four candidate reference regions (CER, BS, CW, and TW) and the mean cortical (MC) regions using the same time window as the SUVR analysis.",
    "In addition, the observed longitudinal change in MCSUVR agreed well (Pearson r = 0.66, p = 1.03E-8) when cerebellar cortex and brain stem were used as the reference region.",
    "For the ADAD population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with PVC may be optimal for current interventional trials.",
    "While MR data is generally available for most of the ongoing neuroimaging studies, quantification methods that does not require MR [37] [38] [39] have their advantages and warrant further investigation.",
    "However, the observation of amyloid deposition in the cerebellar cortex of familial AD cases [13, 14] had led to the identification and validation of pons as an alternative reference region [15] .",
    "Among several reference regions, core white matter provided the greatest sensitivity for the detection of longitudinal changes.",
    "Cohen's d effect size measure was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the annual rate of change in MCSUVR.",
    "The estimated sample size needed for anti-amyloid trials were similar between the two studies.",
    "Using ADNI [ 18 F]-florbetapir data, Chen et al.",
    "In the LNC cohort, larger test-retest variability was observed when core white matter was used as reference region in comparison to cerebellar cortex referencing.",
    "An IDAIF was obtained using a recently developed technique by combined analysis of TOF-MRA, T1-weighted MR, and dynamic PET imaging data [30, 34] .",
    "We focused our comparison of quantification methodology on those utilizing structural MR obtained on the same participant.",
    "[16] and our group [18] found PVC improved the power to detect longitudinal amyloid burden change.",
    "For the LC cohort, using either cerebellar cortex or brain stem as the reference region, longitudinal MCSUVR change was not significant without partial volume, while PVC revealed the change (Table 4 ).",
    "These techniques require longer dynamic PET acquisitions initiated in synchrony with tracer administration and are less attractive because of increased participant burden, study cost and complexity of quantification.",
    "One study comparing two-component (brain and non-brain) vs. threecomponent (gray matter, white matter, non-brain) reported relative advantages and disadvantages of both methods [20] .",
    "The participants included in this study were recruited as part of the international Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) [26] .",
    "When a full 70-min dynamic scan was available, regional time-activity curve for each ROI was extracted followed by regional binding potential (BP ND ) (DVR-1) estimation using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellar cortex (CER) serving as the reference [23] ."
