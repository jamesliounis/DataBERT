  "query": "What dataset was used in the paper?",
  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "Data was collected by means of participant observation and semi-structured, individual interviews.",
    "Tesch\"s method (1990) was employed to analyse the data.",
    "In the coding process, the raw data were read, and units of meaning were identified and labelled.",
    "The study used a generic qualitative approach, as we intended to uncover and understand the perspectives of the participants involved in the LLP (Merriam, 1998) .",
    "The recent Global Information Technology Report (Bilbao-Osorio, Dutta & Lanvin, 2014 ) ranked the quality of the South African educational system at 146th out of 148 countries.",
    "Ethical research procedures included receiving approval from the relevant authorities, acquiring written informed consent from the participants, anonymity of places and people, and confidentiality of sources.",
    "Triangulation was applied across the four data sources, namely principals, district officials, facilitators and academics, to search for convergent evidence.",
    "When parts of a system are connected, synergy can be fostered (Duffy & Reigeluth, 2008) .",
    "An investigation by Louis et al.",
    "Furthermore, triangulation was used to compare the participant observations with the interview findings.",
    "In this study, it was found that the poor working relationships among people within the system, contributed to disconnections within the system.",
    "South Africa was ranked the lowest amongst 50 countries in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) undertaken in 2003 (Letseka et al., 2012) .",
    "The aim of this study was to determine what may be learned about system-wide change from an exploration of the LLP.",
    "The crisis in the South African school system is well-documented (Bloch, 2009; Fleisch, 2008; Letseka, Bantwini & King-McKenzie, 2012 ).",
    "The system of interest in this study is the school district.",
    "The presenters used protocols, for example, taking the participants down \"The ladder of inference\" in order to challenge assumptions that were placed at the top of the ladder.",
    "An academic noted:\nThey were all speaking from their own experience, their own research, so they weren't speaking from book knowledge; so in that sense, it had emotive value, rather than purely cognitive value (A4).",
    "Therefore, \"when the demands on one part of the system are linked to the demand of other parts, those parts will only perform well if they are connected together\" (Bar-Yam cited in Duffy, 2010:3) .",
    "The data was analysed on completion of the LLP and did not have an action research orientation.",
    "This research found that in the long term, those schools whose leaders had participated in the programme achieved higher learner test scores than schools whose leaders had not been a part of the programme (Page, 2010 ).",
    "Field notes were used to keep track of observations, encounters and decisions made during the study.",
    "A qualitative approach was used to research this change intervention.",
    "Triangulation can be useful in facilitating cross-data validity checks (Patton, 2002) .",
    "An LLP framework (Figure 1 ) was then developed to conceptualise the intervention.",
    "Rorrer, Skrla and Scheurich (2008) have contended that the school district is an important agent for system change.",
    "The lead researcher of this paper, who was responsible for the data collection and analysis, was not actively involved in decision-making regarding the design and implementation of the LLP.",
    "However, since the different versions of the ANA were not comparable over the years, the GPLMS research remained inconclusive (Fleisch & Sch\u00f6er, 2014) .",
    "Various challenges arising from the systemic context of the school district were highlighted in the findings.",
    "Data triangulation from all four sources, namely principals, district officials, facilitators and academics, confirmed that the LLP enabled the building of more collegial relationships between principals and district officials.",
    "Based on the findings in this investigation, it is theorised that a programme such as the LLP does have the potential to initiate systemic change in the school district, subject to the following conditions.",
    "Two of these were the Systemic Enhancement for Education Development (SEED) in the Western Cape, and the Quality Learning Project (QLP) in De Aar (Fleisch, 2006) .",
    "The perspective that the district office is a catalyst for system-wide change in districts is supported empirically (Kaufman, Grimm & Miller, 2012; Zavadsky, 2012) .",
    "Instead, the solution can be found in the relationship among the various elements within the school district (Senge, 2006: 67) .",
    "However, more research into district change efforts are required in order to provide empirical guidance that district leaders might utilise to help them bring about system-wide change in their districts (Rorrer et al., 2008) .",
    "Furthermore, the district office has an awareness of the local context in which schools operate (Taylor, Muller & Vinjevold, 2003) .",
    "The emergent themes and sub-themes are presented in Table 1 .",
    "A system-wide approach requires the \"collective capacity\" of all those within the system \"to communicate and connect, to drive change forward and to align effort\", rather than individualised approaches, which focus on improving the \"individual capacity of single schools\" (Harris, 2010:197-198) .",
    "The participants were observed during the LLP contact sessions.",
    "A district official concurred as follows: The observation findings indicate that, in order to promote greater interaction among the participants, the venue for the contact sessions was reviewed.",
    "Harris and Jones (2010) emphasise that systemwide change is unlikely to succeed without structures for collaboration.",
    "This approach provided flexibility in addressing the emergent needs of the participants.",
    "Reflection and review by the academics took place after each session, in order to decide on the themes for the following session.",
    "The crisis is also confirmed by the results of both national and international evaluations.",
    "Systems theory (Banathy, 1991) gives primacy to the interconnectedness and interdependence of the elements in a system, as well as the evolutionary nature of a system (Banathy & Jenlink, 2004) .",
    "Thereafter, a memorandum of understanding between the two universities was drawn up, and funding was sought for the intervention.",
    "At the core of the framework (Figure 1 ) was improved academic outcomes in the school district.",
    "The term \"collective\" used here refers to any group of people who share work, such as partnerships, work groups and communities (McCauley et al., 2010) .",
    "Researchers from both universities were assigned to investigate the LLP.",
    "The interview schedule was piloted among each of these groups to strengthen validity.",
    "Codes were grouped into categories and synthesised into sub-themes and themes."
