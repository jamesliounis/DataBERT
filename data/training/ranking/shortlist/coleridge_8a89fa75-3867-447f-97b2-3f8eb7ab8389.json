  "shortlist": [
    "Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).",
    "Initially submitted April 10, 2017 ; accepted for publication March 20, 2018 .",
    "Univariate frequencies and percentages of GA, household SES, and covariates were computed for the eligible target population, the 2-year analytical cohort, and the kindergarten analytical cohort.",
    "First, we repeated all analyses using GA based on reported date of last menstrual period; these analyses included California births.",
    "Multivariable analyses with generalized estimating equations (GEE) based on the normal distribution were used to estimate differences in scores for each outcome accounting for clustering of subjects by ECLS-B-designed sample clusters using an exchangeable correlation structure.",
    "Briefly, the composite index was derived from the average of standardized values for each component variable; see Web Appendix 1 for more detail on index construction (17) .",
    "Although there was a large overall sample size, some GA-SES exposure groups had sparse data, especially for the early and moderate preterm groups and in analyses stratified by race/ethnicity.",
    "A major strength of the present study is the utilization of a large, population-based sample of US children with rigorous, prospective measurements of cognitive development at multiple time points.",
    "Finally, we repeated all analyses using complex sample weights.",
    "Finally, we assessed whether associations between GA, household SES, and cognitive/academic outcomes differed according to race/ethnicity by adding 3-way interaction terms as well as stratifying by race/ethnicity.",
    "Household SES was measured at wave 1 using a composite index created by ECLS-B reflecting mother's and father's education, mother's and father's occupation, and household income.",
    "Sampling weights were not applied in our main analyses because our primary interest was in obtaining internally valid estimates of relationships between GA, household SES, and outcome scores among study participants rather than in ensuring that our findings were representative of 2001 US births.",
    "Using data from a population-based cohort for studying outcomes of preterm birth, however, comes with the caveat that it may underrepresent children who are more ill and unable or unwilling to participate in such a study.",
    "Of the 6,150 children who were eligible for the analyses, 5,700 completed 2-year data collection and 3,900 completed kindergarten data collection (Web Figure 1) .",
    "Figure 1 displays hypothesized relationships among GA at delivery, prenatal and postnatal household SES, and cognitive outcomes based on existing guidance for representing effect modification in directed acyclic graphs (19) .",
    "To describe the observed joint distribution of gestational and household SES, we computed mean scores and standard deviations for the 25 subgroups of 5 GA categories and 5 household SES quintiles.",
    "The distributions of GA, SES, and covariates were similar in the 2-year and kindergarten analytical cohorts compared with the eligible target population.",
    "Presence of additive interaction was assessed by testing statistical significance of the set of interaction terms using the generalized score test statistic, by plotting modelpredicted scores by GA and socioeconomic quintile at mean covariate values, and by examining associations between preterm birth and each outcome after stratifying by socioeconomic quintile.",
    "This study analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a population-based longitudinal study of about 10,700 children born in 2001 and followed through kindergarten (17 (2007) (2008) .",
    "Findings were similar to our main analyses when using measurements of GA with last menstrual period, using alternative SES measures (including using the wave-2 measurement of SES quintile), and applying complex sample weights.",
    "We also standardized scale scores to a normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation (SD), 1) in order to interpret results in terms of standarddeviation differences between groups.",
    "While we were not able to assess whether such changes in SES occurred, the composite SES index-reflecting income, educational attainment, and occupation-was plausibly more stable against this concern compared with using only household income to measure SES.",
    "Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of our findings.",
    "However, the analytical samples were similar to the eligible target population in terms of gestational age, SES, and demographic factors.",
    "These findings echo previous research linking childhood poverty with adverse impacts on cognitive development and academic performance (2, 26) .",
    "The addition of terms for interaction between GA group and household SES was not statistically significant (P = 0.82; Figure 2B ).",
    "Due to differences across studies to date in terms of study populations, ages and tests used for assessing cognitive and academic outcomes, and methods of measuring SES, it is unknown whether findings are generalizable to the general US population.",
    "Adjusting models also controlled for child's race/ ethnicity, child's sex, parity, maternal marital status, and maternal age at delivery.",
    "ECLS-B cognitive assessments were administered by trained survey staff in subjects' homes using standard procedures (17) .",
    "potential confounders of both the exposure-outcome and modifier-outcome relationships were child's race/ethnicity, child's sex, maternal parity, maternal age at delivery, and household structure.",
    "In the present study, only postnatal measurements of household SES were available, and so our testable hypothesis was limited to assessing whether postnatal household SES modified the associations between preterm birth and cognitive outcomes.",
    "Third, we assessed the robustness of our results to our choice of SES measurement variables (25) by defining SES using maternal education (less than high school, completed high school, some college, bachelor's degree or higher), household income at wave 1 (<$25,000, $25,000-$75,000, >$75,000), household poverty at wave 1 (<130% of federal poverty level, 130%-185% of federal poverty level, >185% of federal poverty level), and using the SES composite index as a continuous variable.",
    "Stratifying by socioeconomic quintile, estimated risk differences for the preterm and early term groups compared with term children were similar across socioeconomic quintiles (Web Table 2 ).",
    "Dropout rates were exaggerated because about half of those lost between the 2 waves were part of a planned sample-size reduction carried out by systematically reducing sampling rates (17) .",
    "We analyzed scale scores, which estimated the number of items that a child would have answered correctly if they had been asked all of the scored questions (24) .",
    "The results of their study may be driven by its inclusion of only children born at 34 weeks or later; our study similarly found small cognitive deficits for late-preterm children and no significant deficit for early-term children.",
    "We fitted 2 sets of models: 1) estimating the mutually adjusted independent associations of GA (early preterm, moderate preterm, late preterm, and early term compared with full term (referent)) and household SES (quintiles, with the highest SES quintile as the referent) with each outcome; and 2) adding terms for interaction between GA and household SES (e.g., early preterm \u00d7 SES quintile 1).",
    "The study was approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board.",
    "SES was measured at the family level in the Taiwanese and Swedish studies and at the neighborhood level in the US study.",
    "Because of the known socioeconomic disparities across racial/ethnic groups in the United States, future studies should specifically examine whether relationships among preterm birth, SES, and cognitive development vary across racial/ethnic groups.",
    "SES is represented both as a potential confounder and effect modifier of the relationship between GA at delivery and cognitive outcomes.",
    "It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study in assessing potential complexities of pathways through which preterm birth and SES may separately and jointly influence children's cognitive outcomes.",
    "Scores in the full sample ranged from 12.39 to 82.48 on the reading assessment and 10.85 to 69.69 on the mathematics assessment.",
    "Because the ECLS-B did not report normed scores, our primary analyses used children's scale scores.",
    "Results from 3 studies in Taiwan (13), Sweden (14) , and the United States (public school children in Georgia) (15) showed that lower childhood SES exacerbated associations between preterm birth and lower school test scores in adolescence (13, 14) as well as lower firstgrade statewide test scores (15) .",
    "In our study, estimated disparities comparing the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups were larger than those comparing early preterm with term children and term-born children in the lowest SES quintile had predicted scores lower than most preterm groups in the highest SES quintile.",
    "For all 3 outcomes, 3-way interaction terms with race/ethnicity were not significant, and there was no significant interaction between GA and household SES in any racial/ethnic group in analyses stratified by race/ethnicity.",
    "There was no statistical evidence of additive interaction between GA and household SES (P = 0.47; Figure 2A ).",
    "They could also be excluded if the primary survey respondent was not the biological mother (n = 150) or if the birth weight reported on the birth certificate was implausible for GA based on cutoffs established by Alexander et al.",
    "There was no statistical evidence of additive interaction between GA and household SES (P = 0.68; Figure 2C )."
