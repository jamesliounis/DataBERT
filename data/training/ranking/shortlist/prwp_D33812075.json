  "shortlist": [
    "In this Appendix I provide details on the sample construction and some additional tables and graphs.",
    "In contrast, in this paper, I use census data obtained from IPUMS International (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, IPUMS, 2019), hosted at the University of Minnesota Population Center, which reports harmonized representative samples (typically 10%) of full census micro data sets for a large number of countries.",
    "The paper is organized as follows.",
    "3 On the other hand and more closely related to this paper, it contributes to the pool of studies using administrative data or census data.",
    "This set of papers includes on the one hand those that use household survey data or opinion surveys.",
    "In the case of Latin America, most of the literature has used household survey data or public opinion surveys (see for example, Hertz et al., 2007; Narayan et al., 2018; Neidh\u00f6fer et al., 2018) given that long panel data as well as administrative/registry data that allow the researcher to link generations are rare.",
    "First, it adds to the literature on intergenerational mobility in general (see Black & Devereux, 2011 , for a survey) but specifically to the literature focusing on the geography of socioeconomic mobility that recently received more attention in part because of the work of Chetty et al.",
    "This paper contributes to this goal by creating the estimates of mobility at a disaggregated geographical level and making them available in an online data appendix for future research.",
    "This empirical approach has been used in Alesina et al.",
    "Three sources of data have been typically used to estimate intergenerational mobility: 1cross-sectional samples of adult populations with retrospective questions about parental education, for example, Narayan et al.",
    "For instance, Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2021) study mobility among different marginalized groups and analyze geographic differences in India; Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2022) use 1940 census data to study the role of school quality in mediating upward mobility in the US; Van der Weide, Ferreira de Souza, and Barbosa (2020) study mobility at the sub-national level in Brazil; and most closely related to this paper, Alesina et al.",
    "(2020) use full-count census data for individual countries focusing on a much larger set of correlates.",
    "In this paper, I estimate intergenerational mobility in education for LAC countries at a disaggregated regional level using data from 91 censuses.",
    "In the Appendix, I report similar estimates (see Table A6 ) and maps (see Figure A5 and A6) at the district level, which corresponds to the finest administrative unit available in the data set.",
    "In particular, I use 91 samples of population and housing censuses from 24 countries, which are run to compute the total population and contain an educational attainment question in their questionnaire.",
    "Section II describes data and methodology.",
    "This paper expands over them in terms of country coverage of the region and cross-country comparability.",
    "Notes: The source of these estimates is Munoz and Siravegna (2021) .",
    "I run univariate regressions pooling all the countries linking IGM to geographical and initial conditions that have been discussed in previous studies on intergenerational mobility outside the continent (for example, see Alesina et al., 2021) .",
    "Given the unbalanced nature of the data set in terms of coverage over time and across countries, further research could shed more light on potential determinants of mobility in Latin America by focusing on the analysis of particular countries with relatively high data coverage, such as Chile, Mexico, or Brazil, which makes the collection of correlates by administrative unit easier.",
    "(2021) allow regional comparison but pooling together estimates generated with retrospective information and those with coresident samples, which may be problematic (seeMunoz & Siravegna, 2021).",
    "Below, I explain how this is addressed and I refer to recent evidence showing that the coresidence bias is likely to be very small for the indicators used in this paper.",
    "Country-level estimates of intergenerational mobility focused on secondary education can be found in Table A7 of the Appendix.",
    "For example,Munoz (2021) and Van der Weide et al.",
    "where the variables and subscripts in common have similar interpretation as in Equations 1 and 2, and the additional subscript r refers to the district or province according to the level of geographical dis-aggregation used in the analysis (provinces as the baseline estimates and districts as an additional exercise reported in the Appendix).",
    "Table A3 in the Appendix provides coresidence rates by country for different age groups.",
    "(2018) use household survey data that covers the 96% of the world population; (2) panel data long enough in its time dimension to include the socioeconomic or educational attainment of two generations, for example, Celhay, Sanhueza, and Zubizarreta (2010) use the Chilean CASEN to estimate mobility in schooling and income;",
    "Columns (5) and (6) give the number of observations used to estimate the country-specific IGM statistics (children whose parental education is reported in the censuses).",
    "(2018) , is valuable because it can help researchers understand the importance of localized patterns and drivers of IGM, as shown for the case of developed countries.",
    "The parameters \u03b3 b o , \u03b3 b y , \u03b8 t again refer respectively to fixed effects by decade-cohort of the generation above that co-resides with individual i, decade-cohort of the individual i, and census year.",
    "Column (2) gives the number of observations used to estimate the country-specific IGM statistics (children whose parental education is reported in the censuses).",
    "I examine whether these patterns hold in this novel data set by estimating IGM for males and females separately and documenting how the gap between these populations has evolved across birth cohorts.",
    "Columns 5and 6give the number of observations used to estimate the country-specific IGM statistics (children whose parental education is reported in the censuses).",
    "Table A4 reports the rates of co-residency by country-sample for different ages.",
    "4 The key advantage of this data set is that it contains the entire population (or at least a large share of it publicly available) at a point in time, allowing me to analyze mobility at a very disaggregated geographical level.",
    "Similarly, summary statistics of alternative estimates of intergenerational mobility that consider secondary education at the province and district levels can be found in the Appendix (see Table A8 , A9, A11, and A12).",
    "Recent studies have used household and public opinion surveys with retrospective information about parents' education to document the levels of IGM in education in LAC at the country level (for an example, see Hertz et al., 2007; Narayan et al., 2018; Neidh\u00f6fer, Serrano, & Gasparini, 2018) .",
    "The 24 countries under study are: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Saint Lucia, Suriname, and the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela (see Table A1 in the Appendix for the details about the fraction of the data available by census), and they represent 91 samples of these 24 countries drawn at various points from 1960 to 2012.",

    "Figure A16 and Figure A17 in the Appendix show estimates by sub-population rather than the gap between them for countries with data for at least 4 decades, suggesting that the gap has been increasing in favor of women because of an increase (decrease) more than proportional for them in upward (downward) mobility.",
