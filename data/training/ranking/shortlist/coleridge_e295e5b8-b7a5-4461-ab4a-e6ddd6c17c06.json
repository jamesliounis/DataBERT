  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "GraphPad prism 7 software (GraphPad, USA) was used to perform all statistical analysis and graphics.",
    "This study protocol was approved by the Kayseri Training and Research Hospital ethics committee (2020-3-/23), which allowed sampling for diagnostic and surveillance purposes.",
    "The primers used in PCR reactions were designed according to the sequences published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [21] .",
    "Lastly, we have compared the whole genome of hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 with a dataset of 3970 available SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries retrieved from GISAID.",
    "According to published case reports and GISAID metadata entries, at least 9 SARS-CoV-2 samples in the nearby clusters had a recent travel history to Iran [30] .",
    "The reads were aligned to the previously assembled sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank Accession: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner v.0.7.1 with the MEM algorithm [25] .",
    "The significance level was set as a p value of less than 0.05 where \ufffd p<0.05.",
    "Our data are in agreement with that of Harcourt et.al., in which SARS-CoV-2 replicated rapidly in Vero cells after an initial eclipse phase and increased gradually, peaking at 48 h post-infection [42] .",
    "In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of Vero E6, MA-104, SW-13 and HeLa cell lines to infection by SARS-CoV-2.",
    "The libraries were prepared using pooled amplicons with Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500 (Illumina, USA) platform with a 2x150 Cycle Kit (Gen Era Diagnostics Inc., Turkey).",
    "For multiple sequence alignment, complete (>29,000bp) and high-coverage genomes (n = 3970) were used from the GISAID database.",
    "The reason for the high fraction of Australian cases in this cluster was possibly due to the high number of submitted sequences, as Australia was the third country that had the most sequences submitted to GISAID by April 2020.",
    "The quality of the raw data was evaluated by FastQC v.0.11.5 (Babraham Bioinformatics) and low-quality bases, primers and remnant adapters were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.32 [24] .",
    "The first sequence was generated in March 2020 and deposited in GISAID (EPI_ISL_417413).",
    "The filtered variants and reference SARS-CoV-2 genome were used to generate the consensus sequence using bcftools v1.9 [27] .",
    "Recently, a study showed that the Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited to SARS--CoV-2 specific CPE.",
    "The cultures were harvested by scraping cell monolayers from at different time points (6, 12, 18, 24, 48 and 72 h) and stored at -80\u02daC.",
    "The sequencing produced approximately 4.9 M paired reads (150 bp x2), of which 95.2% of the reads were mapped to the reference genome.",
    "A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for being included in the study.",
    "Further studies with more sequences are needed to determine the distribution of this variant in Turkey and tracing the origin of this strain.",
    "Two of those sequences (Turkey/HGSM/5516/2020 and Turkey/HGSM/8010/2020) were located in the same cluster and share cluster-specific variants (G1397A, T28688C, G29742T).",
    "The whole genome sequence was submitted to GenBank (ID:MT327745.1) and GISAID (ID: EPI_ISL_424366) and the raw data deposited on SRA (SAMN15062833).",
    "The variants were called by using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.3.8.0 with the HaplotypeCaller algorithm [26] and were manually inspected in GenomeBrowse v2.1.2 (GoldenHelix).",
    "All cell lines used in this study purchased from ATCC cell culture company.",
    "However, the sequence comparison showed that both sequences carry key Iranian cluster mutations including G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T.",
    "In this regard, the potential limitation of this finding is the limited number of sequences available for analysis.",
    "Overall, these results showed that the Vero E6 and MA 104 cell lines can be efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2.",
    "We determined that the titer of the passage 2 virus was 2.8x10 4 FFU/ml, while the titers of the passage 3 and passage 4 viruses were 4.3x10 5 FFU/ml and 4.9x10 6 FFU/ml, respectively (Fig 2) .",
    "Sequencing analysis revealed that this unidentified pneumonia was considered to be caused by a novel coronavirus [14, 16] .",
    "Those samples in nearby clades include several cases from Pakistan, Kuwait, Canada, and Norway (Fig 7) .",
    "The hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait.",
    "There are hundreds of coronaviruses are circulating broadly among mammals and birds that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [1, 6, 7] .",
    "We also showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait and that the cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and to share the common unique nucleotide substitutions.",
    "Our results are in agreement with the previous reports showing that SARS-CoV replicated efficiently and caused CPE in Vero and MA-104 cell lines [44] [45] [46] [47] .",
    "The cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and shared the common unique nucleotide substitutions, G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T, which were also found in our strain and partially in several Iranian cases [30] .",
    "SARS-CoV-2 replicated with a similar kinetics in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, but the MA-104 cells supported replication of SARS-CoV-2 slightly less well than the Vero E6 cells (Fig 6A) .",
    "As we observed CPE in the infected monolayers, RT-PCR was used as a confirmatory assay.",
    "On the same day, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",
    "In addition to Vero E6 cells, the MA104 cell line pertaining to its suitability for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and facilitate further study of SARS-CoV-2.",
    "The samples were separated on 12% resolving and 5% stacking SDS-PAGE gels in a mini electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad, USA) at 100 V for 1 h. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, USA) under wet conditions using a trans-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA).",
    "This geographically dispersed cluster is known to be branched in the early period of the epidemic and genetically clustered very closely together.",
    "In addition, analysis of the NP partial gene sequences of the Iranian samples in GISAID showed that all of the Iranian partial sequences (n = 15) also contain the T28688C, which is another key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of this clade.",
    "In this study, we isolated the SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Turkey with confirmed COVID-19.",
    "These results indicated that propagation of the hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain in Vero E6 cells led to an increasing in the viral titers in each passage.",
    "These authors found that HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication but no CPE was observed, suggesting that both Vero cell types support amplification and replication of SARS-CoV-2 but that Vero E6 cells are more suitable for amplification and quantification [42] .",
    "To determine the titer of the passage 2 virus a focus forming assay (FFA) was performed as described previously [22] .",
    "The primers used in the PCR reactions were 2019-nCoV_N1 forward primer (5 0 -GACCCCAAAATCAGC GAAAT-3 0 ), 2019-nCoV_N2 reverse primer (5'-GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA-3') and 2019-nCoV_N3 forward primer (5'-GGGAGCCTTGAATACACCAAAA-3'), and 2019-nCoV N2 reverse primer (5'-GCG CGACATTCCGAAGAA-3'), respectively.",
    "The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.",
    "The phylogenetic analysis showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was located outside of the main clades (S, G, and V) and clustered with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Australia, Canada, England and Kuwait (Fig 7) .",
    "The common key mutations and similar travel histories of the closely clustered cases may indicate possible links between our case and the Iranian epidemic."
