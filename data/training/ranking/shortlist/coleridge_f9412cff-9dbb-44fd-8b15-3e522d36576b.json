    "Full details on the procedure can be found in Algorithm 1.",
    "Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data are commonly used in longitudinal studies to forecast disease trajectories over time.",
    "Using data from the ADNI, the Disease-Atlas [5] demonstrated performance gains over both simpler neural networks such as LSTMs and traditional methods from biostatistics -demonstrating the advantages of the Disease-Atlas as a method for joint modeling and highlighting its potential as a tool for clinical decision support.",
    "The Disease-Atlas was used to jointly forecast longitudinal observations of clinical scores and scan measurements, treating the transition to Alzheimer's Disease from either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Cognitively Normal (CN) states as our event of interest.",
    "Once again, the Disease-Atlas outperforms joint models across the majority of longitudinal variables and time steps, with gains of 40% on average -highlighting the benefits of a deep learning approach to joint modeling.",

    "Observations were discretized to 6-month (or 0.5 year) intervals, and missing measurements were imputed using the previous value if present, and the population mean otherwise.",
    "From the cross-validation performance, we see that the Disease-Atlas consistently outperforms both the standard neural network and traditional benchmarks for survival analysis particularly on shortterm horizons -improving the LSTM by 10% and JM by 7% on average across all time steps.",
    "The Disease-Atlas captures the associations within the joint modeling framework, by learning shared representations between trajectories at different stages of the network, while retaining the same sub-model distributions captured by joint models.",
    "Despite the many advantages of joint modeling, the standard forms suffer from limitations that arise from a fixed model specification and computational difficulties when applied to large datasets.",
    "For the i th patient at time t, observations are made for a K-dimensional vector of longitudinal variables is defined to be the first time the event is observed after t, which allows us to model both repeated events and events that lead to censoring (e.g.",
    "Handling Irregularly Sampled Data.",
    "Given the promising initial results found in our companion paper for Cystic Fibrosis patients [5] , we investigate the application of the Disease-Atlas -a novel conception of the joint modeling framework using deep learning -to jointly predicting the expected time-to-transition to Alzheimer's disease and the values of longitudinal measurements, providing additional clinical decision support to doctors evaluating potential Alzheimer's disease patients.",
    "The samples obtained can then be used to compute expectations and uncertainty intervals for forecasts.",
    "To obtain these measures, we apply the Monte-Carlo dropout approach of [3] by approximating the posterior over network weights as:\nWhere we draw J samples\u0174 j using feed-forward passes through the network with the same dropout mask applied across time-steps.",

    "While we focus on both the continuous valued and time-to-event predictions for tests in Section 4, we include descriptions of binary predictions here for completeness.",
    "Given the completeness of the datasets we consider, we assume that task groupings match those defined by the task-specific layer of the network, and multitask learning is performed using Equation 8 and Algorithm 1.",
    "In this paper, we investigate an application of the Disease-Atlas to forecasting longitudinal measurements and expected time-totransition to Dementia for patients at risk of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "Effective clinical decision support often involves the dynamic forecasting of medical conditions based on clinically relevant variables collected over time.",
    "We start with an RNN at the base of the network, which incorporates historical information into forecasts by updating its memory state over time.",
    "For our current architecture, where we group similar tasks into task-specific layers, our loss function corresponds to:\nGiven that survival predictions are the primary focus of many longitudinal studies, we set \u03b1 c = \u03b1 b = 1 and include \u03b1 T as an additional hyperparameter to be optimized.",
    "The network, as shown in Figure 2 , is conceptually divided into 3 sections: 1) A shared temporal layer to learn the temporal and cross-correlations between variables, 2) task-specific layers to learn shared representations between related trajectories, and 3) an output layer which computes parameters for predictive sub-model distributions for use in likelihood loss computations during training and generating predictive distributions at run-time.",
    "For longitudinal predictions, we focus on both the Disease-Atlas and JM which are able to generate predictions at arbitrary time steps in the future.",
    "In this investigation, we use a random selection of 60% of patients for our training data, 20% for validation and the final 20% for evaluation as per the CF tests.",
    "We address issues with irregular sampling by grouping variables that are measured together into the same task, and training the network with multitask learning.",
    "From the above, the negative log-likelihood of the data given the network is:\nWhere f c (.",
    "This could reduce errors in cases where multiple sample rates exist and simple imputation is used, which might result in the multioutput networks replicating the imputation process instead of making true predictions.",
    "To evaluate predictions of the event-of-interest -i.e.",
    "The final layer computes the parameter vectors of the predictive distribution, which are used to compute log likelihoods during training and dynamic predictions at run-time.",
    "For notational convenience, we drop the subscript i for variables in this section, noting that the network is only applied to trajectories from one patient at time.",
    "This allows the parameters of the predictive distributions at t + \u03c4 to be computed in the final layer, i.e.h t = [h t , \u03c4 ].",
