  "shortlist": [
    "Table 1 shows the author, sample size, measures, types of traits, attrition, and ages for each study.",
    "This technique first estimates the number of studies that may be missing as a result of publication bias, with publication bias meaning studies with effect sizes that are low or near zero relative to the average effect.",
    "Publication bias reflects the possibility that the studies retrieved for the meta-analysis may not include all studies actually conducted, with the most likely omissions being studies that failed to find statistically significant results.",
    "First, we reviewed the reference list from an earlier meta-analysis of rank-order consistency for longitudinal studies (Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000) .",
    "2 Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the relevant variables in the unaggregated database.",
    "Because the latter studies used repeated measures F and t test results, we transformed these scores into the raw score metric by using formulas provided by Morris and Deshon (2002) .",
    "According to their interpretation of the data, there is evidence for increases in social dominance and decreases in social vitality, as Helson and Kwan (2000) proposed.",
    "Finally, we further organized the data around the sex of the sample studied, aggregating data within the categories of male, female, and data from combined samples.",
    "First, by examining change across studies, we can effectively control for the nature of the samples used in existing longitudinal efforts and weight findings from larger samples more heavily.",
    "To determine the comparability of the samples across the life course, we broke down the study characteristics and moderator variables by the age categories that were used to organize the data (see Table 3 ).",
    "For example, Twenge (2000 Twenge ( , 2001 Twenge ( , 2002 has reported that younger cohorts are more neurotic and extraverted than older cohorts.",
    "The procedure as implemented in the DVBID library generates three estimators of missing studies, L 0 , R 0 , and Q 0 .",
    "To examine the relationships between the moderator variables and the effect sizes, we first created data sets for each trait category that included as many nonoverlapping studies as possible.",
    "c Data were unreported means on personality measures from the samples described in the respective studies that we acquired from the authors of the original studies.",
    "When possible, we tested the likelihood of publication bias by using a trim and fill procedure (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) .",
    "We will first present data for each trait across the life course or the portion of the life course for which there were enough studies to make estimates.",
    "d These studies reported on five or more samples, so the aggregate N is provided.",
    "We used the L 0 estimator as it is the most robust estimator in the case of problematic distributions described above (S. Duval, personal communication, November 19, 2003) .",
    "When the years of assessment were not available, we used estimates of the year of assessment on the basis of information in the article, such as year of publication.",
    "Finally, Helson and Kwan presented data indicating small increases in openness, with some contradictory evidence across cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.",
    "Fifth, after developing a preliminary list of studies, we reviewed the references cited in each article for additional studies.",
    "We also found a very small but statistically significant increase in the age 50 to 60 period (d \u03ed .06, p \u03fd .05), although the latter effect demonstrated publication bias and should be interpreted cautiously.",
    "In either case, we obtained an estimate of the overall effect size (denoted by d) for each age category and personality factor, which was also tested for statistical significance by computing a 95% confidence interval.",
    "Unfortunately, there are very few data to date on this topic as it has only recently become a focus of longitudinal researchers (Mroczek & Spiro, 2003; Roberts, 1997; Small et al., 2003) .",
    "Finally, Roberts, Robins, Caspi, and Trzesniewski (2003) reviewed a more comprehensive list of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies than previously captured in narrative reviews.",
    "Sixth, after developing a relatively comprehensive list of studies, we asked knowledgeable colleagues to review the list and alert us to any studies that were overlooked.",
    "The computation was based on reported means and standard deviations for 93% of the studies and inferred from F and t values in 7% of the studies.",
    "We also attempted to extract information about ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status (SES) to see whether the studies were comparable on these statistics across the life course.",
    "On the basis of the findings of this study, there appears to be a consistent effect for longitudinal studies that track change over longer time periods to show larger mean-level changes.",
    "If neither sample size nor time period varied, we selected effect sizes from the oldest age period from the sample, as these were rarer than other types of change estimates.",
    "In the present study, we have assembled the largest metaanalytic database of longitudinal studies of mean-level personality change in existence in order to address the question of how personality traits change across the life course.",
    "Then, the trim and fill procedure calculates hypothetical effects for potentially omitted studies and then reestimates the average effect size and confidence intervals on the basis of the influence of studies that would have been included in the analyses if they had been published.",
    "When a sample provided results across multiple assessment waves, we retained the effect size with the largest sample size.",
    "The structure of the data necessitated several levels of aggregation to ensure that the effect size estimates were independent.",
    "Second, we reviewed additional databases developed by Brent W. Roberts on personality development (Roberts, Robins, et al., 2003) .",
    "Many of these effects were replicated in a longitudinal study of men and women, in which, for example, it was found that occupational success was related to increases in dominance, whereas satisfaction was associated with decreases in negative emotionality (Roberts, Caspi, & Moffitt, 2003) .",
    "Many of these studies reported information on rank-order consistency and mean-level change, although Roberts and DelVecchio did not examine the latter in this previous study.",
    "If a study contributed multiple effect sizes that were coded as measures of agreeableness and openness, then these effect sizes were aggregated into one estimate of change for agreeableness and one estimate of change for openness.",
    "We examined the distributions for each effect and did not run the trim and fill procedure on data that demonstrated this type of pattern.",
    "Similarly, Schuerger, Zarrella, and Hotz (1989) found that clinical samples, which we can assume are less emotionally stable, were less consistent than nonclinical samples.",
    "b\nTo determine which age categories each study contributed to, identify the age at the midpoint between the ages listed under the Ages and time intervals column.",
    "Interjudge reliability, indexed by the intraclass correlation, was quite high across the whole database (r \u03ed .93).",
    "We used various statistics from the studies to estimate the standardized mean difference scores.",
    "The distinct patterns of rank-order consistency and mean-level change demonstrated across these two meta-analyses provide definitive support for Block's (1971) original argument that different indexes of continuity-change are relatively independent of one another.",
    "Furthermore, there are now a number of clear empirical cases where it has been demonstrated that rank-order consistency and mean-level change coexist in the same longitudinal study (Haan et al., 1986; Mortimer, Finch, & Kumka, 1982; Roberts, Helson, & Klohnen, 2002; Robins et al., 2001) .",
    "The effect size measure used in this meta-analysis was a standardized mean difference and was calculated by subtracting the mean of the personality trait scores at Time 2 from the mean at Time 1 and dividing this raw mean difference by the standard deviation of the raw scores at the first time point.",
    "These findings imply that longer longitudinal studies will provide larger estimates of change, a result that needs to be taken into consideration when planning new studies and evaluating the results of existing longitudinal research.",
    "We proceeded as follows to create data sets with independent effect sizes for each of the trait categories.",
    "Finally, we tested the effect of cohort standing, meaning the year when the sample of any given longitudinal study was born.",
    "This omission in the longitudinal database is more conspicuous when one considers the wealth of studies arguing that culture, especially in the particular forms found in Asian countries, has a profound effect on psychological functioning (e.g., Markus & Kityama, 1991) ."
