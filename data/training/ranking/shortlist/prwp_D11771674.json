    "This paper relates to several strands of literature.",
    "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
    "Therefore, the data exhibit enough within-country variation for the identification strategy of this paper that, as previously",
    "The detailed list of countries in the sample, some summary statistics, and the average wholesale dependence of each country are reported in Table 1 .",
    "Section 3 describes the empirical methodology and data sources.",
    "Although not the main focus of the paper, I",
    "Panel D -Main US sources July 25, 2007 to August 24, 2007 .",
    "The paper also relates to the literature on financial structure and riskiness.",
    "The data for the construction of the dummy variable come from banks that were directly exposed to Lehman suffered a large relative decline in their returns, of about one percentage point in a single day.",
    "Panel A shows summary statistics by country for the 662 banks that were present in the event study.",
    "This hypothesis can be formally tested by estimating the parameters of the following regression:",
    "The focus of the paper is the estimation and characterization of the evolution of these coefficients during a 10 (trading) days windows following each of the two events under study.",
    "Furthermore, the evidence in this paper is robust to the standard criticism that it is difficult to separate trade links and financial links at the aggregate level to determine the channels of contagion.",
    "The results reported in Figure 10 control for this possibility by adding a dummy variable that indicates if a bank has some foreign or state ownership, using information from Micco and Panizza (2006) , at the cost of importantly reducing the sample to 586 banks.",
    "The results indicate that in all cases, banks with higher wholesale dependence reduced loans by more than banks with lower dependence, and except for the specification focusing on the growth of the loan to asset ratio (Column 3), the coefficient \uf067 is statistically significant at conventional levels.",
    "For further details, seeFTSE (2006).",
    "The results reported in Panel C add a dummy that takes the value of one for banks that declared exposure to Lehman in the weeks following its collapse to the baseline specification to control for the possibility that the measure of wholesale dependence may be capturing direct exposure to Lehman, and, therefore, counterparty risk rather than wholesale liquidity dependence.",
    "This magnitude is large in absolute terms and also compared to the 3.3 percent decline relative to pre-event trend documented for the whole banking sector in Panel B of The previous results come from a one-factor model that only controls for market returns.",
    "Cassola, Hortacsu, and Kastl (2009) use bidding data from the European Central Bank (ECB) auctions for one-week loans to study how the bidding schedule of banks changes during the crisis and how these changes relate to ex-post bank performance.",
    "The event study literature typically privileges the analysis of cumulative returns because the cumulative impact of the events is easier to visualize.",
    "Finally, some recent papers have tried to assess the role of different mechanisms in the transmission of the crisis.",
    "Finally, this paper also contributes to the literature on international contagion (Glick and Rose, 1999; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 2000; Kaminsky et al., 2003; among others) , by providing evidence of a different channel through which financial turmoil may spread across countries.",
    "The table shows the summary statistics of the coefficients of the two factor model regression:",
    "Again, the results are qualitatively similar to those previously reported, but the pre-event trend is much less marked than in Figure 5 and the magnitude and significance of the CADR decline increase respect to that figure (1.6 percent three days after the event, statistically significant since the event day).",
    "Robustness checks in the appendix present results for different estimation and event windows, including results obtained estimating the parameters of the preferred equation (5) using data from just before each event, as in a standard event study.5 This means that during periods of inactivity all returns are assigned to the first day in which there is new activity.6 The large number of banks in the sample and the length of the window makes including dummies for individual corporate events unfeasible.",
    "The first set of results reported in section 4 will come from this simple model to establish that there is an event affecting the banking industry in the selected dates, before turning to test whether the events have a differential effect across banks.",
    "Standard robustness checks to changes in the estimates of the abnormal returns, the measures of wholesale dependence, the sample of countries and banks, and the event and estimation windows are reported in the Appendix.",
    "Studying lower frequency data runs the risk of confounding the impact of the events with the policy responses they triggered such as the massive interventions by the Federal Reserve, the ECB, or the US and other governments.",
    "To address this problem, I re-estimated the parameters of the baseline model, as well as the abnormal returns, using trade-to-trade returns that assign a price differential to the whole period between two consecutive trades, as proposed by Maynes and Rumsey (1993) .",
    "The results, reported in Panel B show a similar, although slightly larger and more significant stock price decline for banks that relied more on wholesale funds during the Lehman episode, confirming and strengthening the baseline findings.",
    "This increased reliance on wholesale funds can also be seen in bank-level data from Bankscope that show an increase in the use of wholesale sources of funds in the 5 years preceding the beginning of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",
    "(2009) , this paper looks at a broad set of banks across a large number of developed and developing countries, and for the most part focuses on differences in returns across individual banks to identify a specific transmission mechanism rather than focusing on common factors and their determinants.",
    "properly testing the hypothesis at this level would require controlling for other cross-country sources of return differences, which is beyond the scope of this paper.",
    "This effect can be seen in Panel 10 C of Figure 2 , which shows on a daily basis similar information to panel A for the months surrounding this episode.",
    "The paper also shows that these results are robust to a battery of changes in the details of the specification and estimation, and to controls for other potential sources of differential effects related to individual banks' riskiness, size, direct exposure to Lehman Brothers, ownership, or specialization.",
    "In fact, Panel B.2 of Figure 9 shows that larger banks did relatively better during the Lehman episode, with a marginally significant CADR of about 2 percent (p-value of 0.13).",
    "Bank data comes from the latest available balance sheet before June 30, 2007 from the Bankscope database.",
    "Although the earlier literature emphasized the benefits of these alternative sources of financing (Feldman and Schmidt, 2001; Calomiris, 1999) , some voices of concern about the implications of this liability structure for systemic vulnerability have recently been raised.",
    "In addition to the overall increase in the use of wholesale funds documented in the previous section, the table shows that there is important heterogeneity in this use across countries.",
    "Panel A -Cross country summary statistics for the ratio of retail deposits to liabilities.",
    "This paper focuses on one specific dimension of financial connections, the worldwide reliance of banks on global liquidity markets, and provides evidence that it played a quantitatively important role in the transmission of the crisis, especially in the critical days following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.",
    "The rest of the paper will show that these findings are not driven by particular model choices or alternative explanations.",
    "To show this, the figures in panels A.1, B.1, and C.1 display the average impact of the event in each type of banks (akin to that reported in Figure 4 for the whole banking system).",
    "This paper complements this literature by providing further evidence of the consequences of a drying up of interbank lending markets on banks' performance and lending 6 activities worldwide, thus highlighting the possibility of international contagion and giving further ground for liquidity support by central banks.",
    "This paper contributes to this literature by providing systematic evidence of the role of the sources of bank financing in the international transmission of the crisis.",
    "The point estimates of the differential returns 1, t \uf064 , and the corresponding CADR are reported in Panel C. Henceforth, all reported differential returns and CADR will come from this baseline specification unless stated otherwise.",
    "(1) 2(3) (4) Panel B -Complete sample summary statistics for the ratio of retail deposits to liabilities.",
    "The estimation window used was of 180 calendar days before June 30, The figure shows the difference in cumulative abnormal returns (CADR) between a bank with high and low wholesale dependence (75th and 25th percentile of the global distribution of wholesale dependence) and its 90 percent confidence bands for different measures of abnormal returns and wholesale dependence.",
    "where * 01 t t t \uf03c\uf03cdenote the beginning and end of the time window where parameters are estimated (the estimation window), and ,, ict R is the stock-market return of bank i, from country c, between trading days t -1 and t. In the preferred specification, , ct R is a vector that contains the overall stock-market and banking industry return in country c at time t (two-factor model), but I also estimate a one-factor model that only controls for the stock-market return to characterize the evolution of the whole banking industry.",
    "Panel C -Main US sources August 31, 2008 to September 30, 2008 The figure shows the cumulative abnormal returns of banks with low and high wholesale dependence (25th and 75th percentile of wholesale dependence) in a window of ten days before and after the Lehman event of September 15, 2008 (Panel A), the difference in cumulative abnormal differential returns (CADR) between those two groups of banks and its 90 percent confidence bands (Panel B), and the difference in cumulative abnormal differential returns relative to the pre-event difference (the average difference in abnormal returns between these two groups of banks between t=-10 and t=-1) (Panel C)."
