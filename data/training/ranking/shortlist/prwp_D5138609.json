    "This paper is structured as follows.",
    "For instance, data collected by the World Bank in 1992 have been used to show widely varying results depending on the methodology chosen to assess impact.",
    "Similar evidence is found in studies of BRAC, Grameen and PKSF's partner organizations.",
    "Consumption data from 1,072 households in one district of Bangladesh are used to show that the largest effect on poverty occurs when a moderate-poor BRAC client borrows more than 10,000 taka ($200) in cumulative loans (Zaman 1998) .",
    "This feature of better-off households benefiting more was also borne out by detailed case-study evidence (Farashuddin et al 1998) and by comparing participants of credit programs who cater to different socio-economic groups (Montgomery et al 1996) 10 .",
    "Table 1 illustrates the scale of these institutions.",
    "Recent evidence from a re-survey of the same households suggests that microcredit has significantly contributed to reducing poverty (Khandker 2003) .",
    "Khandker (2003) uses the panel data discussed above to suggest that there is some positive externality due to micro-credit programs but that the overall spill-over benefits are somewhat limited.",
    "(Chowdhury and Cash 1996).",
    "The literature typically uses 'control groups', usually 'eligible non-members' or 'recently joined members' in order to address the problem of the counter-factual.",
    "Section 3.0. proposes several factors that contributed to its scaling-up.",
    "However, several studies also show that between 15-30 percent of microcredit members are from 'non-target' households measured in terms of land (Mustafa et al 1996 , Montgomery et al 1996 , Zaman 1998 , Khandker 1998 .",
    "Naved (1994) 14 finds that the women credit-program participants in her sample felt their status had improved due to the fact that they were seen as income earners for the family through their access to credit.",
    "On the other hand, using the same data and a different way of correcting for selectivity bias, Morduch (1998) finds that microcredit does not have a significant impact on consumption levels and therefore on income poverty.",
    "Two facets of these trends are worth highlighting.",
    "TRDEP's borrowers' initial endowment conditions is shown to be higher than BRAC's (average pre-loan landholding is 46 and 30 decimals for TRDEP and BRAC members respectively and the percentage of The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) carried out an extensive study of the impact of PKSF POs microcredit program using longitudinal data of 3000 households between 1997-2000.",
    "Goetz et al (1996) On the whole, the evidence presented by those who argue that microcredit improves female status within a household appears more convincing than that argued by the 'skeptics' camp.",
    "The findings of an impact assessment of ASA borrowers conducted in 2003 suggests that the average value of physical assets increased by 127% in rural areas and grew by about 150 percent in urban areas over a five year period.",
    "First the underlying thread of the 'positive' argument, that access to an important household resource (credit) enhances a female's status within the household is both intuitively appealing and resonates with the theoretical literature on bargaining models of the household (Lundberg and Pollack 1993) .",
    "The literature broadly supports the hypothesis that access to microcredit contributes to poverty reduction in Bangladesh though the evidence is not entirely clear-cut 9 .",
    "Naved (1994) uses Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques to identify the effect of participation in Save The Children's savings and credit program in Manikanj.",
    "It is interesting to compare this figure with Copestake's (1992) evaluation of India's Integrated Rural Development Project (IRDP) where the proportion of non poor households ranged up to 36%.",
    "Around the same time a team of researchers at Chittagong University, led by Professor Yunus, began an action-research program that provided loans to poor households in a few villages.",
    "There is also evidence which suggests that households who join microcredit programs a few years after the village group has been established tend to be less poor compared to the members who join at the start of the program (Matin 1998) .",
    "Amin et al's (1994) work in thirty six villages in Bangladesh showed that membership in microcredit programs positively affected a woman's decision making role, her marital stability, her control over resources and mobility but has less impact on her attitude regarding marriage and education of their daughters.",
    "10 Montgomery et al compare the performance of BRAC borrowers with the borrowers from a Governmentrun microcredit scheme, the Thana Resource Development and Employment Programme (TRDEP).",
    "The bottom line is that the literature on targeting suggests that microfinance programs are reasonably successful at reaching the poor, and that those households who fall above the stipulated landholding criterion tend to be marginally above the poverty line and are susceptible to transient poverty in certain years.",
    "These indicators have been shown to be relatively accurate correlates of poverty by program administrators who do not have the time, resources or expertise to carry out more sophisticated calculations of poverty for each household in their targeted area.",
    "11 Morduch only includes households who fulfil the targeting criteria of the three organizations and labels them 'eligible households' 12 These results are statistically significant at the 95% level.",
    "There have been attempts to cater for the 'selectivity bias' problem but with varying degrees of success.",
    "The process of trial and error included combining males and females in the same credit group and then changing this to separate groups divided by gender.",
    "One important mode tested was the efficacy of providing loans for group projects compared to offering loans to individuals with peer monitoring.",
    "As such, the experiences of scaling-up discussed here draw primarily upon these large MFIs.",
    "While this paper focused on the lessons from the scaling up of the microfinance industry, and its impact on the poor, the story would be incomplete without briefly mentioning the future challenges that the industry faces in Bangladesh.",
    "Morduch shows that consumption variability is 47% lower for eligible 11 Grameen households, 54% lower for eligible BRAC households and 51% lower for eligible BRDB households compared to a control group.",
    "One of the key findings was that 'microcredit has a positive and significant effect on poverty status of the program households\u2026.'",
    "However, the impact of credit on female empowerment, or a reduction in 'female vulnerability' has also received considerable attention.",
    "Recent progress on this, led by the central bank, PKSF and industry representatives, needs to be built on.",
    "ASA keeps paperwork requirements to a minimum, has decentralized most decision-making to the field and overall has a very lean operation (Choudhury 2003) .",
    "BRAC, with its large multi-faceted programs, has had a long history of working with donors and the evolution of this relationship is worth highlighting.",
    "A large proportion of extremely-poor households, measured by initial landholding size, join microcredit programs (Husain 1998 , Zaman 1998 , Khandker 2003 .",
    "Programs that have been developed to cater for these constraints include (",
    "An important part of the consortium funding arrangement and the move toward program funding has been to improve the predictability of resource flows -for instance BRAC secured financing for its Rural Development Programme for a five-year period from the donor consortium.",
    "For instance Grameen Bank has introduced a system of rating branch offices based on the achievement of specific targets which not only include standard loan recovery, but also factor in social indicators such as the proportion of Grameen children going to school.",
    "For instance in Khandker's sample, sixty percent of the sampled members have less than twenty decimals of land.",
    "Moderate poverty falls by around 15% and ultra-poverty by 25% for households who have been BRAC members for up to three years controlling for other factors according to the author.",
    "In recent years the standard Grameen-model has undergone more refinements in order to cater to different niche markets as well as to different life-cycle circumstances.",
    "After the \"big four\", the next largest NGO 2 has 0.7 million clients and there are only ten NGOs who have more than 100,000 borrowers.",
    "Khandker (1998) estimates that for every 100 taka lent to a woman, household consumption increases by 18 taka; interestingly the figure is 11 taka if the same amount was lent to a man.",
    "For instance, the net contribution of micro-credit on moderate poverty for non-participants is a small decline of 1.1 percentage points between 1991/92 and 1998/99 compared to a decline of 8.5 percentage points by borrowers in the same village."
