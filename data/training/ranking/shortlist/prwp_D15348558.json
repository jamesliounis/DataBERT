  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "16 The data are from FinStats 2009, a world-wide financial database put together by the World Bank, which covers 40 key financial indicators for the period 1980-2008 (coverage quality varies between variables).",
    "Note: Median regressions on cross-sectional averages for available data in the period 1980-2008.",
    "The results can be summarized as follows:",
    "Note: First, a cross-sectional regression model is estimated on country averages, controlling for GDP per capita (squared), population size and density, young and old age dependency ratios, a financial offshore center dummy, a transition country dummy, and a large fuel exporter dummy.",
    "The data come from a variety of sources including IFS, BIS, WDI, S&P, Bankscope, Axco, and national sources.",
    "The controls were selected iteratively, based on individual statistical significance and collective explanatory power.18 The level of GDP per capita at which financial services start to appear is measured by the intercept of the crosssection paths for the main depth indicators with the horizontal axis.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Table 3 reports the results of adding the policy controls to the regressions, using the subset of FD indicators over which policy variables were found to have the most significant impacts.",
    "The main stylized patterns that emerge from the econometric analysis of the available data are discussed in what follows.",
    "Based on cross-section development paths (derived from an econometric exercise that averages countries' financial development over a thirty-year time span for a large set of FD indicators), the paper finds that-except for some notable outliers whose deviant behavior is in itself quite informative-these patterns are, indeed, broadly verified.",
    "Table 2 , which reports the results of the EEI benchmarking, provides revealing insights on how the underlying frictions that affect the development process are themselves affected by financial development.",
    "2 See for example Merton and Bodie (2004) .",
    "In the first stage, we take the medians for each country of its FD indicators over the whole sample period and then conduct a cross-section estimate over the medians.",
    "\"Participation\" is understood throughout this paper as akin to, but with a more general meaning than, the traditional definition of \"financial inclusion.\"",
    "The paper then explores possible reasons underlying the gaps in FD that emerge relative to the benchmarks obtained from the cross-section paths.",
    "The workhorse median regression cross-sectional model regresses the financial indicator of interest on: GDP per capita (squared), population size and density, fuel exporter dummy, age dependency ratio, offshore financial center dummy, transition country dummy, and year-fixed effects.",
    "We now proceed to conduct a simple empirical analysis of aggregate FD indicators.",
    "We average all data for 2005-07 and add each crash variable separately to the regressions of private credit to GDP.",
    "Scale effects are measured by the coefficient of population size in the workhorse regression.",
    "To unscramble these effects we separate countries into four groups according to their initial per capita income (low, lower middle, higher middle, high) and plot the year-by-year medians for each of the groups, together with the underlying cross-section path obtained by averaging data over the whole period for which it is available.",
    "For the relevant analysis and suggestions for \"redemption\" see, for example,Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999); Calvo and Reinhart (2002);Eichengreen and Hausmann (2002);and Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza (2005).",
    "In a second stage, we compare this cross-section aggregate development path, which serves as a benchmark, with the individual, dynamic development paths followed by specific country groupings, grouped by initial income levels and by regions.",
    "31 To eliminate the effect of recurrent volatility, we also include in the regressions the standard deviation of normalized private credit.",
    "In particular, we find that the quality of the informational environment (as proxied by credit information) is concave but subject to scale effects.",
    "To better capture the underlying FD patterns, we employ quantile (median) regressions, which are less influenced by outliers.",
    "The results on three key patterns-order of appearance, convexity, and returns to scaleare displayed in Figure 2 , where activities are ordered by the per capita income level at which they appear.",
    "Rajan and Zingales (2003) present a more complete narrative rooted in the same basic threads.",
    "Following work by de la Ize (2010, 2011) , the paper first separates the frictions into agency frictions, which restrict the scope for delegation, and collective frictions, which restrict the scope for pooling and participation.",
    "This is the main theme discussed in Anginer, de la Torre and Ize (2011).12 Huang and Ratnovski (2011) show that the dark side of bank wholesale funding dominates when bank assets are more arm's length and tradable.13 SeeAschcraft and Schuerman (2008) andGorton and Metrick (2010).14 SeeShleifer and Vishny (2011).",
    "To limit lower tail distortions when a non-linear fit is imposed on the data we only use for these estimates a linear per capita GDP term.",
    "The additional controls are GDP per capita (squared), population size and density, fuel exporter dummy, age dependency ratio, offshore financial center dummy, transition country dummy, and year-fixed effects.",
    "This result is congenial to that in De Gregorio andGuidotti (1995), who found that in high income countries FD was positively correlated with output growth during 1960-1985 but that the correlation was negative in the 1970-85 subperiod.",
    "Annual country residuals are derived from the crosssectional estimates which are used to calculate annual country-group medians.",
    "5 An earlier strand of thought viewed financial development as driven by the steady mitigation of asymmetric information failures such as moral hazard and adverse selection (see, for instance, Akerlof, 1970; Spence, 1973; and Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) .",
    "From this construct emerges the basic proposition that the order of appearance of financial activities, which should reflect the intensity of the frictions to which they are exposed, should correlate with scale effects and the shape (convexity or concavity) of the development paths.",
    "SeeFeyen, Lester and Rocha (2011).23 See North (1990).24 Consider, for example, the cases of credit card services and e-banking.",
    "More recent papers (such as Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Feyen, and Levine, 2011) have come closer to recognizing that banks and markets play different roles at different stages of economic development, that is, that form might also matter.",
    "The filtered variables are then regressed on the splines and the expected values are plotted.",
    "While caveats of course apply (the lack of significance may simply reflect the limited quality of the indicator), this mixed result could suggest that while relationship lending and the use of collateral can remedy for informational problems in banking, informational frictions are more difficult to circumvent in the case of capital markets.",
    "Similarly, as information becomes more abundant and governance arrangements improve, monitoring costs come down and monitoring can increasingly rely on third parties (rating agencies, market analysts, investment advisors, external auditors), statistical methods (scoring systems, value-at-risk calculations), and accounting and disclosure standards.",
    "Appearance, Convexity, and Returns to Scale of FD Indicator Paths Note: Appearance is the level of GDP per capita at which financial services start to appear is as captured by the intercept estimated in a cross-sectional regression of 1980-2008 averages with the dependent variable in question and GDP per capita.",
    "Indeed, many commentators (for instance,Haldane, 2010, or Turner, 2010 have suggested that the pre-crisis explosion of finance in the high-income countries was precisely driven by such dynamics.",
    "To make the data as comparable as possible across countries, we control for economic development (based on the level and square of GDP per capita) as well as various other factors that can be considered to be exogenous (at least in the short-term) to FD policy and the FD process itself, including: 17 population (size, density, young and old dependency ratios) and country-specific characteristics (fuel exporter, offshore financial center, transition country).",
    "More recently, it was popularized by Kindleberger (1989) and Shiller (2006) .",
    "2 Yet, few papers have attempted to analyze these frictions systematically in terms of the way they interact and what this may imply for the dynamics of FD.",
    "2) However, for several depth indicators, including bank deposits, life insurance premia, pension fund assets and domestic public debt, the dynamic paths followed by the lower income countries also cross the cross-section paths from below, suggesting the presence of leap frogging effects.",
    "This analysis also leads to useful insights as regards the order and relative ease with which frictions are overcome.",
    "3 And when discussing the impact of financial structure on growth, the literature, at least until very recently, generally concluded that function matters more than form.",
    "In all cases, we first filter these policy variables (effectively we also \"benchmark\" them) using the same set of controls as for FDIs.",
    "Key features worth noting are as follows: 1) With a few exceptions (public debt and non-life insurance), the dynamic paths followed by all financial depth indicators in the higher income countries cross the cross-section paths from below, suggesting quantum jumps in financial development at the higher end of the income scale."
