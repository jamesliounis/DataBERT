    "Our analysis dataset was obtained from the ADNI standardized analysis sets described in Wyman et al.",
    "In addition, the reference space itself is iteratively optimized from the GM and WM probability maps of different subjects using the DARTEL algorithm (Ashburner, 2007) .",
    "(2008) and Cuingnet et al.",
    "The analysis dataset was constituted by taking the standardized ADNI 1.5 T dataset and replacing every 1.5 T scan by the corresponding subject 3 T scan when available, resulting in a set of images with mixed field strengths (about 80% 1.5 T and 20% 3 T) from all distinct subjects with the same size and diagnosis repartition as the 1.5 T dataset.",
    "The previous study of Abdulkadir et al.",
    "Data used in the disease classification experiments described in the following were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).",
    "Among the MCI subjects present in the analysis dataset, we know from subsequent visits that some were later diagnosed AD in the course of the ADNI study.",
    "We used the screening scans from the 1.5 T dataset (818 image sets corresponding to distinct subjects: 229 controls, 401 MCI, 188 AD) and the baseline scans from the 3 T dataset (151 image sets corresponding to distinct subjects: 47 healthy, 71 MCI, 33 AD).",
    "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
    "2 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).",
    "c o m / l o c a t e / y n i c l 2011; Liu et al., 2012) .",
    "These cases, which are specified by their unique ADNI identifier in Appendix C, relate specifically to 2/229 controls, 2/401 MCI patients, 1/188 AD patient in the 1.5 T dataset, and 1/47 control, 4/71 MCI patients, 2/33 AD patient in the 3 T dataset.",
    "Other studies showed that volumes of medial temporal lobe regions computed using NeuroQuant exhibit statistically significant differences between early AD patients and controls (Brewer et al., 2008) and correlate with clinical scores (Kovacevic et al., 2009) .",
    "Our findings are in line with the observation of Cuingnet et al.",
    "(2002 ), Fischl (2012 and the references therein, which segments an incoming scan in a large number of anatomical structures and subsequently computes corresponding volumes.",
    "by focusing on temporal regions, might prove more effective in such classification tasks involving localized statistical differences between the populations to be compared.",
    "Whereas ADNI takes care of this aspect for the standardized dataset, we employ in our clinical settings automated image quality assessment (Mortamet et al., 2009) , artifact corrections and checkup for acquisition parameter compliance on the scanner console.",
    "1-3 for AD detection on the standardized ADNI dataset using, from left to right: total GM, temporal GM, and hippocampus normalized volumes estimated by FreeSurfer and MorphoBox, respectively.",
    "Classification accuracy was evaluated on a standardized ADNI dataset comprising 818 1.5 T and 3 T scans from different subjects (229 controls, 401 MCI, 188 AD) using leave-one-out cross-validation.",
    "In the case of FreeSurfer, the TIV (called intracranial volume in the FreeSurfer 5.1.0 documentation), total GM, and hippocampus and ventricular volumes were read directly from the asegstats output file.",
    "For consistency with Cuingnet et al.",
    "We also conducted experiments on the pure 1.5 T dataset that yielded very similar results to those obtained from the combined 1.5 T/3 T dataset, and are thus not reported.",
    "Tables 3-7 report classification results from SVMs independently trained with volumetric features from MorphoBox and FreeSurfer and whole-brain voxel-wise GM concentrations from SPM.",
    "The GM tissue probability maps in native space were obtained from SPM8 New Segment (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) and subsequently normalized to the population template generated from all images in the standardized ADNI dataset using the iterative DARTEL approach (Ashburner, 2007) , a procedure that took about three days on a standard PC.",
    "These findings are consistent with the observation from the plots in Figs.",
    "In the following, we report classification experiments for time windows of 2 years and 3 years, given that a one-year time window does not provide a sufficient number of converters for statistically meaningful comparisons.",
    "The remaining voxels, of the order of 300,000 in our experiments, were detrended for age as recommended by (Dukart et al., 2011) and fed into the SVM classifier.",
    "Also, following Cuingnet et al.",
    "Sections 2-4 describe the data, brain morphometry algorithms and multivariate classification algorithms used in our evaluation.",
    "ADNI is the result of the efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada.",
    "Such priors were computed using the DARTEL tool of SPM8 (Ashburner and Friston, 2009 ) from a dataset of 136 MR scans of healthy subjects (41 \u00b1 25 years) acquired at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, in the same conditions as the template image.",
    "Therefore, this outcome is in line with our previous observation (see Subsection 5.2) that FreeSurfer's hippocampus estimate tends to be more sensitive to disease than MorphoBox's.",
    "This trend relates to both the widespread availability of brain imaging equipment in clinical routine and research, and the concurrent development of neuroinformatics which has materialized in several free as well as commercial image analysis software packages released over the past 15 years: SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, BrainVisa, Mindboggle, NeuroQuant, and NeuroQLab, to mention a few.",
    "The 3 T dataset alone appeared too small to serve as a basis for meaningful statistical comparisons between morphometry methods.",
    "For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.",
    "In each classification scenario, we compared classification performances from three distinct feature sets: normalized voxelwise GM concentrations computed via SPM and a set of a priori chosen volumes extracted using either FreeSurfer or MorphoBox.",
    "Voxels were then excluded if their modulated GM probability was less than 0.2 or if short of significance (p N 0.05) according to a two-sample t-test (Chaves et al., 2009) .",
    "This was done using linear regression against age on the healthy cohort, as depicted in Figs.",
    "All subjects from the 3 T dataset are also included in the 1.5 T dataset, having been scanned at 3 T less than 4 months after their 1.5 T scan.",
    "(2011) , McNemar's chi square test using the Yates correction was applied to assess differences in accuracy between classifiers as well as to test whether each classifier was equivalent to a random classifier.",
    "Linear regression plots for hippocampus volume detection on the standardized ADNI dataset using FreeSurfer (left) and MorphoBox (right).",
    "As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.",
    "Consistently with previous work on classification in AD, we used support vector machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) as implemented in LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) to respectively perform automatic classification of AD patients vs healthy controls, MCI patients vs healthy controls, AD vs MCI patients, and early vs late AD converters among MCI patients.",
    "(Narayana et al., 1988) and gradient distortion (Schmitt, 1985) .",
    "Again, differences between classifiers were small, although statistically significant.",
    "It should therefore be kept in mind that the classification accuracy measures reported in Section 5 are inherently lowered by diagnosis uncertainty, assuming that automatic classification errors and diagnosis errors are weakly correlated, which is reasonable given that ADNI diagnosis was not based on morphometry.",
    "(2011) in the AD vs normal classification among over twenty method variants, and the experimentally observed accuracy levels are consistent with previous studies that used the same implementation (Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008; Cuingnet et al., 2011) .",
    "In this work, we used FreeSurfer version 5.1.0 and were mainly interested in temporal GM, total GM, hippocampus and ventricular volumes output by FreeSurfer as potential imaging biomarkers of ADrelated brain atrophy.",
    "Consequently, it is not surprising that FreeSurfer achieved relatively more accurate classification as morphometric differences between the groups under comparison were mainly localized in the hippocampal region as opposed to being widespread throughout the brain.",
    "Experimental results are reported in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6."
