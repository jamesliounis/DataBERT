  "shortlist": [
    "Wilmott et al 27,28 discuss an Index of Agreement (IoA) for comparing observed and modelled time series, and the IoA was used by Warner et al.",
    "The program reads observational data and forecast system output, fills in missing data, creates new data structures for comparison purposes, carries out the comparisons, and presents the results in tabular form.",
    "Vested et al 26 used some traditional statistical variables, such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and model mean error (ie, bias); the authors use both these parameters.",
    "A summary of relevant terms and quantities is shown in Table 2.",
    "Dingman & Bedford 30 used statistical tests of significance (mean error, variance, skewness) to assess skill, but introduced non-dimensional skill scores (eg, 1 -mean error/mean value) as a way of determining whether deviations between model and data are real or whether they are simply related to the noise.",
    "A Pattern Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was used by Robinson et al 32 to evaluate salinity fields.",
    "The authors use mean error, variance (ie, standard deviation), and skewness (actually, positive and negative outlier frequency).",
    "These data are processed and analysed using several techniques which include tidal prediction, harmonic analysis, gap filling and interval conversion, Fourier filtering, and other methods.",
    "In the above section, the general procedures of skill assessment are described, the relevant data variables, model run scenarios and statistical variables are defined, and target frequencies and associated acceptance error criteria for each variable are discussed.",
    "Although no single set of statistics can quantify model performance perfectly, several, easily-calculated quantities have been chosen that provide relevant information on the important categories of model behaviour.",
    "However, the authors suggest that the errors in the observational and modelled datasets can influence skill assessment in different ways; it is assumed that the errors in both types are equivalent.",
    "The comprehensive set of skill assessment statistics are calculated to provide relevant information on model behaviour and global assessment of errors.",
    "Thus, all data (model-derived and observed) is analysed at the 0.1h (6 min) interval.",
    "These values provide information on the model's behaviour in frequency space and can also illuminate the role of friction and non-linear processes.",
    "33 Stow et al 34 reviewed several skill approaches and metrics, including univariate comparison of predictions and observations such as RMSE and average error (used by the authors), average absolute error (which is related to the authors' central frequency) and reliability index, correlation coefficient, and modelling efficiency (not used by the authors because they are difficult to interpret).",
    "This software ingests model forecasts and observational data, fills in gaps and missing data, creates specific time series such as concatenated forecasts, extracts skill-specific parameters such as times and amplitudes of high and low water, and computes the skill scores.",
    "Specific methods for each process are discussed below.",
    "The target frequency for the standard statistics and acceptance error limits for the time series are also given for reference to an application of a particular model system skill assessment.",
    "Gregg et al 35 gave a comprehensive list of ocean biological models with data assimilation and their applications of skill assessment, in both ecosystem/ biogeochemical and fisheries efforts.",
    "The standard suite of statistics includes the SM and the frequency with which errors lie within specified limits (CF), the RMSE and SD of error, the positive outlier frequency (POF), the maximum duration of positive outlier (MDPO), the negative outlier frequency (NOF) and maximum duration of negative outlier (MDNO).",
    "22 For a general approach Dee 23 presented guidelines for standard validation documents and processes.",
    "The constituent with the highest correlation with the total observed signal is then subtracted from the observed time series, and the matrix is recalculated with a residual time series in place of the observed.",
    "Also, they describe multivariate comparisons (eg, cost functions), multivariate pattern evaluation, and comparison of spatial maps; these the authors have not used because they are limited to point data.",
    "Three statistical parameters are shown: the CF of water level amplitude errors, the RMSE of water level amplitudes, and the CF of the error in the amplitude of high water and low water events.",
    "The output of the model runs is processed and saved in groups of individual values so the relevant variables (Table 1) can be calculated.",
    "These skill scores were computed by comparing the OFS outputs with observations (at 6min intervals) for the twelve month period of calendar year 2008.",
    "The RMSE and Standard Deviation (SD) are required to be calculated, but these statistics have limited use since errors are not always expected to be normally distributed and CF is easier to explain to users lacking a technical background.",
    "24 However, following Williams et al 40 it was decided to limit use of metrics to those statistics which could be easily explained to the marine navigation user community (primarily commercial pilots and ship drivers, commercial and recreational fishers, and recreational boaters) and did not require a mathematical background to interpret.",
    "Therefore, a skill assessment software package 41 has been developed to compute the skill assessment scores automatically using data files containing observed, nowcast, and forecast variables.",
    "The above target frequencies (1) and durations (3), plus SM, RMSE, SD, and WOF (for water levels only) are required for the assessment of nearly all variables, and are collectively called the Standard Suite of Statistics.",
    "The values of R are required for both the modelled and observed time series.",
    "For example, it is assumed that the specific hydrodynamic model used has been validated for momentum and mass conservation, that it has an established domain of applicability, and that the authors have sought users (not model developers) to set performance criteria.",
    "To summarise, several classic statistical variables mentioned above, such as RMSE, standard deviation, correct negative fraction and correct positive fraction, and positive predictive value and negative predictive value, are incorporated in the NOS standard skill assessment software.",
    "The corresponding skill assessment software has been developed to compute the skill assessment scores using data files containing observed and modelled variables.",
    "Therefore, it is necessary to concatenate certain of these files to construct several continuous time series for further analysis.",
    "A plot of the errors in hourly water levels at Baltimore, Maryland, (Fig 2) shows that the frequency of errors near the mean is greater than the normal (Gaussian) curve and smaller for values between one and two standard deviations away from the mean.",
    "This method has been programmed for data periods of either 15 or 29 days of continuous data time series.",
    "Werner 31 used a visual analysis of the model response in the frequency domain.",
    "In sum, they have used many of the traditional skill assessment approaches described in the literature.",
    "In the selection of events, the critical values can be either specified as constant values or calculated from the observations using the series mean and standard deviation to select a small number of events (this amounts to dynamically varying criteria).",
    "Fitzpatrick 38 provides metrics he used to assess the skill of water quality models, including the standard RMSE and standard error, the less useful relative error and relative absolute error (which the authors note are unreliable for small values of the observed quantity), and correlation coefficient, and semi-quantitative metrics, such as PCF used byStumpf et al.",
    "To the extent possible, their approach has been followed by the authors.",
    "The main processes are included in the order they occur: (1) parameter setup, (2) acquisition of verified water level observations from the CO-OPS database via the Internet; (3) tide prediction and tidal constituent acquisition from the CO-OPS database via the Internet if necessary; (4) concatenation of model hindcasts, nowcasts, and forecasts to form continuous time series; (5) creation of a persistence forecast based on the tidal prediction (in tidal regions) and observations; (6) computation of the standard statistical variables to produce the skill assessment table; and 7harmonic analysis and tidal constituent comparisons.",
    "The authors' NOS challenge was to develop and apply a robust and pragmatic set of standard analysis and metrics to quantitatively assess the performance of an operational ocean forecast system in a simple but meaningful way that relates to the purpose for which the system was developed.",
    "Wallhead et al 36 use skill metrics such as mean squared error to assess the skill or uncertainty of plankton model predictions.",
    "Similarly, Refsgaard and Henriksen 24,25 presented a generalised framework for quality assurance guidelines for hydrological models, including a consistent terminology (for terms such as model confirmation, code verification, model calibration, and model validation), a methodological foundation for bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling, and some application examples as well.",
    "Information derived from ecological forecasting, often based on coupled physical, biological and chemical models, is increasingly in demand.",
    "For generic purposes, all time series (observations, tidal predictions, and model output) required by the skill assessment programs are processed and reformatted into the same ASCII format.",
    "The SM will indicate how well the model reproduces the observed mean and the CF indicates how often the error is within acceptable limits.",
    "If the SD of the cross-PCD currents is large compared to the SD of the along-PCD currents (ie, R greater than 0.25), a similar comparison must be made for them."
