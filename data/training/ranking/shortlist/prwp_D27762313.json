    "For a detailed discussion, see Cherchye et al.",
    "See Ostrom (2009) orPal (2009), for instance.",
    "The most recent systematic overviews of these studies have been produced by Bel et al.",
    "Gerlach and Franceys (2010) and Whittington et al (2015) remind us that research has a long record of identifying issues that reflect poor choices of tools, of processes and of policies.",
    "SeeBel et al (2010) andCarvalho et al (2012) for recent surveys.",
    "(2005),Estache and Wodon (2014) and more recentlyWhittington et al.",
    "According to Carvalho and Berg (2011) , by the end of 2010, over 250 studies had looked at efficiency levels and many had analyzed their drivers.",
    "See for instanceKomives et al.",
    "To be able to provide a broad picture of the operational and policy implications of institutional weaknesses in the sector, this paper is organized as follows.",
    "Any of these 24 The estimation (for econometric approaches) and computation (for non-parametric approaches) techniques for these types of frontier analysis have improved significantly and can be quite effectively used to reduce information asymmetries on the level of efforts made by operators to optimize the use of their resources to meet their service obligations.",
    "Table   2 illustrates this diversity by focusing on the distribution of countries along two dimensions: the existence of a separate regulatory agency and some experience with PPP.",
    "The introduction of cost and regulatory accounting processes is largely justified by the difficult access to appropriate cost related data, as revealed by empirical research on efficiency measurement for instance.",
    "focus on partial performance indicators or efficiency frontiers; concern for partial equilibrium vs general equilibrium effects), on the estimation or computation methods (which deal more or less well with the identification issues that allow a convincing distinction between causality and correlation) as well as on the specific sample composition in terms of time and country coverage (regionally heterogeneous samples (which tend to be largely biased towards Latin America and somewhat Eastern Europe) vs region specific samples; short vs long periods of analysis).",
    "The evidence from a sample spanning over 10 years (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) suggests that this decision impacted both bidder participation and bidding strategies.",

    "(2010) and Carvalho and Berg (2011) .",
    "Most of the data on WSS focus on expenditures and derive consumption from some assumption of the pricing structure even when there are various pricing options.",
    "The data are relatively new and hence have not yet been treated statistically, at least for external audiences.",
    "Unfortunately, one of the common observations of analysts of the incidence of pricing and subsidies in the sector is that there is very little data on water consumption.",
    "Table 1 , reporting the access rates across regions for both water and sanitation, shows that not all regions are managing to cater to the needs of a growing urban population fast enough.",
    "For instance, Martins and Moura e S\u00e1 (2011) validate for the water sector a result that is already quite well established in energy regulation: the poorest tend to be penalized by the excessive complexity of billing and payment options.",
    "(2016) for a planning perspective.",
    "Most of the information available comes from detailed case studies or cross-country studies in which governance is summarized into a number of limited indicators.",
    "(2015) ; relying on a meta-analysis of studies measuring households' willingness to pay for cleaner water, they find that it is often less than the cost of providing the service.",
    "Gerlach and Franceys (2014) highlight common institutional capacity constraints and a limited understanding of alternative providers.",
    "28 This largely validates the insights provided by the more theoretical research discussed earlier.",
    "Technical and operational data is somewhat more available.",
    "Moreover, initiatives such as the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) promoted by the World Bank, the OECD Water Governance Indicators or the more commerciallyoriented platforms, such as the Global Water Intelligence (GWI) or the International Water Association (IWA), all produce useful partial data sets allowing some degree of benchmarking.",
    "4 For discussions of the impact of policies on institutional choices in the sector, see for instance, Gerlach and Fraceys (2010) , Teismand and Edelenbos (2011) , Herrera, V. and A.E.",
    "Country Diagnostic estimated in 2008 that QFD reached 0.6% on average in the region, based on a large sample of countries.",
    "The data is then usually processed through relatively standardized (and overpriced) software which can be used to simulate any tariff structure.",
    "In a recent institutional snapshot of the sector, Bertomeu et al.",
    "See for instance Costa Carvalho and Menezes Bezerra Campiao (2015) or Barbosa et al.",
    "(2007) use experimental household data from a previous study and suggest that the difference between the price-elasticities under increasing block tariffs (IBT) and uniform rates could be explained by behavioral responses to price structures or citylevel heterogeneity.",
    "G, (for instance to get a sense of the match between the actual efforts to maintain and the expected maintenance needs) and (ii) the capital expenditures, i.e.",
    "Their starting point could take the form of a benchmarking exercise relying on comparable operators in comparable contexts.",
    "29 This is not a fool proof tool but, for many countries, it provides regulators with much more data.",
    "A recent paper by Mande Bafua (2015) relies on a production frontier to analyze the impact of reforms in SSA.",
    "But basic service cost and quality data (e.g.",
    "Ultimately, this paper boils down to a call for a more systematic approach to WSS diagnostics which would minimize the current bias favoring standardized approaches to regulation.",
    "28 From a more technical viewpoint, it is quite important to appreciate the extent to which the conclusions differ according to the modeling methods (e.g.",
    "A survey by Nauges and Whittington (2010) of estimates of own-price elasticity for water from private connections in developing countries suggests that it is in the range from 0.3 to 0.6.",
    "Ostrom (1990) or more recently Pal (2009) ).",
    "However, more and better data are needed.",
    "For instance, Ferraro and Price (2013) showed the effectiveness of technical recommendation, pro-social messages and social comparisons sent to consumers.",
    "For instance, in 2013, according to GWI, 74% of the water tariffs in use in low-and middle-income countries were increasing block tariffs (IBT) and 22% uniform volumetric."
