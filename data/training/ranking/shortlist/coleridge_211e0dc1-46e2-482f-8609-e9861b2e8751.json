    "For example, the use of magnetic resonance imaging to screen potential neuromodulatory treatments for multiple sclerosis has DISCUSSION PAPER resulted in the successful development of a number of therapeutic agents that slow disease progression.",
    "What has generally been proved most effective is a combination of approaches to the support of research and development DISCUSSION PAPER that involves diverse strategies.",
    "They include genomic technologies and computational tools, which resulted in large part from the Human Genome Project; stem-cell technologies; genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9; and, of particular importance to neuroscience, rapidly advancing technologies to study and even control activity in the cells and circuits of living brains and to provide useful maps of connectivity, such as those emerging from the Human Connectome Project and from the Allen Institute for Brain Science.",
    "Such agencies as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAR-PA) typically use this approach, and their efforts have resulted in many important advances, often with clear utility.",
    "It is important to recognize the enormous value that that effort generated: not only was an initial human-genome reference sequence published, but the development of technologies and computational tools that have revolutionized biomedical science was directly supported and encouraged.",
    "\u2022 Encourage and support empirical investigations and ethical analyses to investigate emerging concepts of privacy among cultures and age groups and the risk tolerance of patients and families for participating in genetic and phenotyping studies that involve longitudinal participation and data sharing (with attendant risks to the privacy of their personal data).",
    "Because of the size and complexity of the effort, it was overseen by the Office of AIDS Research, which coordinated work among NIH Institutes and ensured that grants made under the rubric of HIV/AIDS research were germane to the problems at hand.",
    "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has successfully used a combination of approaches whereby some biomedical research projects are supported as a result of unsolicited proposals and others are supported as a result of targeted requests for applications.",
    "Examples include the sharing of data (in conjunction with appropriate ways of protecting the privacy of individuals), the sharing of methods and key reagents by scientists, increased incentives for scientific rigor (as opposed to premature publication), and decreased barriers to partnerships between academic and industrial researchers that address the issue of conflicts of interest.",
    "Those growing success stories also reveal that the genetic analysis of brain disorders is scalable, and with appropriate organization and good policies (such as requirements for data-sharing within the bounds of protecting subject privacy) additional funding would efficiently advance the pace of discovery and thus accelerate investigations into disease mechanisms (Sekar et al., 2016) , the nomination of molecular targets for therapies, and the discovery of candidate biomarkers (Jack and Holtzman, 2013) .",
    "Policy initiatives involving funders and journals are needed to ensure the availability of detailed scientific methods to enhance replicability of results.",
    "The science must be tractable-even if difficult-and there must be an appropriate workforce in the field in question or workers willing to enter from related fields.",
    "An example of a successful public-private consortium that could be used as a model for new collaborations is the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) which played a key role in the identification and implementation of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials.",
    "The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease study (Murray et al., 2013) showed that brain disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States; they are also the largest cause of financial loss due to noncommunicable disease.",
    "The deeper problem that calls for a scientific initiative is how to study pathogenesis of common polygenic brain disorders-how to use rapidly emerging genetic results to inform useful biologic DISCUSSION PAPER experimentation and ultimately therapy.",
    "Our thesis is based on the conjunction of a growing worldwide societal burden of brain disorders with scientific opportunity driven by the maturing of neuroscience and related disciplines, by the recent and continuing emergence of relevant tools and technologies, and by the quality and number of personnel in the field.",
    "The need for research investment is highlighted by the growing global prevalence and costs of neurodegenerative disorders (Hebert et al., 2013; Hurd et al., 2013) and a large disinvestment by industry in brain disorders since 2010 (Choi et al., 2014) with the possible exception of Alzheimer disease clinical trials.",
    "Moreover, the integration of advances arising from the genetic dissection of brain disorders with the kinds of tools and technologies emerging from the BRAIN Initiative is likely to be critical if gene lists are ultimately to be translated in a manner that improves human health.",
    "They typically use a variety of approaches, which may ultimately be specified by a funding agency through such mechanisms as requests for applications.",
    "\u2022 Support advances in human experimental biology (for example, using new physiologic and imaging technologies derived from the BRAIN Initiative) to investigate candidate biomarkers coming from genetic analyses and, when possible, disease pathogenesis.",
    "In his January 2016 State of the Union address, President Obama announced a new initiative in cancer, a Cancer Moonshot that has such goals as accelerating progress by focusing on preventive vaccines, early detection, immunotherapy, pediatric cancer, and data sharing (Lowy and Collins, 2016) .",
    "That \"unsolicited\" approach has been particularly effective for such agencies as the National Science Foundation (NSF), whose mission is the broad support of virtually all fields of basic or fundamental science.",
    "The key factors that now motivate a proposal for an initiative on brain disorders are the rapidly advancing tools and knowledge to facilitate understanding of disease mechanisms, a strong and growing scientific workforce in neuroscience, and a substantial mismatch between research investment and unmet medical need, global disease burden, and rising costs to societies (Bloom et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2013) .",
    "For example, advanced tools to study the expression of genes in single cells were described last year and are already being applied to the analysis of diverse cell types in the brain, but the actual mapping of particular protein complexes-the intended targets of drugs-to particular neural cell types awaits further development.",
    "\u2022 Support completion of the initial goals of the BRAIN Initiative to ensure that the necessary tools and technologies are available to study normal and pathologic brain function, including fundamental understanding of neural-cell types and circuits.",
    "The current federal partners include NSF, NIH, DARPA, the Intelligence Applied Research Projects Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "\u2022 In parallel, support expansion of the BRAIN Initiative to provide tools and to produce and study both in vitro (cellular, organoid, and explant) models and in vivo models of brain disorders on the basis of insights coming from genetics.",
    "To address those, it is essential that newly developed technologies be applied to further understanding of human brain structure and function in health and disease.",
    "A complementary funding approach is to target specific questions or problems that need to be answered or specific technologies that are needed by end users and then to solicit responsive proposals.",
    "Recognizing the great opportunities provided by recent advances in brain research coupled with the critical need for new technologies, a group of federal agencies and private foundations have joined forces and committed funds to the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advances in Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative.",
    "The initiative proposed here is meant to advance and make more widely available platform technologies and data sharing through increased funding and policy initiatives and to enhance collaboration between academe and industry to advance the translation of basic findings as they mature.",
    "Most successful efforts are initially grounded in consultations and workshops among diverse members of the investigator community.",
    "The collaborative focus of so many participants and funding organizations on developing new technologies and using them to elucidate brain circuitry is unprecedented.",
    "An excellent example of such an unexpected benefit is the diverse science underpinning intelligent learning systems, which has led to an enormous number of applications, such as speech-recognition technology and powerful data-analysis tools that are used throughout academe, many industries, and government.",
    "A focus on brain disorders is warranted by its contribution of lifetime disease burden and by the promising technologic advances created by the BRAIN Initiative and the development of tools that are advancing all biology, such as stem-cell technologies, production of organoids, and genome engineering technologies.",
    "That initiative, a 12-year public-private partnership, was begun in 2013 and aims to provide the new tools and technologies needed to accelerate understanding of normal and abnormal brain structure and function.",
    "In the language of industry, such efforts would \"derisk\" brain-disorders research and thus decrease the barriers to reentry for companies.",
    "Perhaps unrecognized in the broader scientific community, those efforts have achieved remarkable success related to many conditions, including autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and common, late-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "The discovery that dopamine was depleted in Parkinson disease led to the development of dopamine replacement therapy, and elucidation of the brain circuitry that is perturbed in Parkinson disease led to treatment with deep brain stimulation that transforms the lives of patients in the middle stage of the disease.",
    "Cancer biologists and clinicians faced scientific challenges, but they also benefited from scientific opportunity-direct access to living tumor tissue excised in biopsies or in surgical treatments and in more recent years the ability to sequence the genomes of large numbers of cancer cells from diverse tumor types.",
    "The BRAIN Initiative, with its focus on technology development and the normal brain, is essential in elucidating how the brain processes information and initiates behavior, and it should continue to be supported.",
    "Much, however, has been learned from prior science initiatives.",
    "The highly damaging effects of these conditions on individuals, families, and society have been well documented by studies of disease burden, direct costs of health care, and economic loss.",
    "The rapid decrease in costs of sequencing DNA and the increase in the ability to analyze and understand the resulting data have led to a truly remarkable acceleration in identification of genetic contributors to many diseases, which in turn is beginning to influence diagnostics and discovery of therapies throughout medicine.",
    "Accelerate technology development to study the human brain.",
    "Thanks to the revolution begun by the Human Genome Project, what had seemed an insuperable problem has begun to yield rapidly to modern genomic technologies being brought to bear on specific disorders by large global consortia.",
    "It is important to recognize how difficult it has been to carry out the science needed to deal with those disorders effectively and what is involved.",
    "\u2022 Support training of clinicians in the interpretation of genetic data and their clinical utility while increasing the number of genetic counselors being trained.",
    "\u2022 Explore avenues to facilitate the adaptation of the most promising biomarker candidates for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders to allow interventions at the earliest possible time, when they are most likely to be effective.",
    "For over 20 years, 10% of the NIH budget was set aside to support HIV/AIDS research; some of the research projects were specified by the agency, and others were \"bottom-up\" projects proposed by members of the scientific community."
