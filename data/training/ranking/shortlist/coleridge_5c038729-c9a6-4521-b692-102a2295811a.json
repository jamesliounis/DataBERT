  "shortlist": [
    "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the merged data from the National Education Longitudinal Study and Beginning Postsecondary Longitudinal Study (NEB) Data Analysis System (DAS).",
    "The next section briefly describes this data set.",
    "These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05.28 Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.",
    "That is the approach used for this report, with an additional adjustment to incorporate the complex sample design into the statistical significance tests of the parameter estimates (described below).",
    "For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 1 in the text, and was generated by the DAS.",
    "Appendix B of this report provides a further explanation of the statistical methods used to create this merged data set.",
    "Each of the steps in the creation of this data set is discussed in the following sections.",
    "The Working Paper Series was initiated to promote the sharing of the valuable work experience and knowledge reflected in these preliminary reports.",
    "The results of this analysis are presented in the next section.",
    "the National Education Longitudinal Study: 1988-94 andBeginning Postsecondary Student Study: 1989-90 Linkage Data File Data Analysis System (DAS) (see appendix B for a description of the DAS).",

    "Table C2 presents the comparison of the selected students from the two data sets based on students' sex, raceethnicity, and age.",
    "The conceptualization of one juncturebeing academically prepared for collegeis based on previous work with the NELS data.",
    "In order to make inferences about the students in each data set, it was important that the respondents drawn from the NELS:88/94 and BPS:90/94 data sets be as close as possible in terms of certain student characteristics, such as age, high school graduation status, and initial Postsecondary Education (PSE) enrollment.",
    "These characteristics were used to link students in each of the datasets, thereby creating a type of \"synthetic cohort,\" to provide values for variables missing in the NELS dataset.",
    "However, the reader should keep in mind the findings are based on projected data.",
    "Each respondent in the NELS data set was matched with a respondent in the BPS data set based on age, sex, raceethnicity, SES, and the characteristics of their first postsecondary enrollment status (e.g., full-or part-time or type of institution).",
    "Substantial effort was made to construct these variables so that they had minimal missing data and were comparable between the two data sets.",
    "A summary of the results of these imputations is presented in table C9.",
    "Three types of statistical procedures were employed in this report: testing differences between means (or proportions), testing for linear trends, and adjustment of means after controlling for covariation among several variables.",
    "These characteristics were used in this project to link students in each of the data sets, thereby creating a \"synthetic cohort,\" to provide values for variables missing in the NELS:88/94 data set.",
    "The complex standard errors (in columns 11 and 12) were calculated using the computer program SUDAAN, which takes into account the complex nature of the sampling design of NELS:88/94.",
    "This matrix can be used by most statistical software packages as the input data for least-squares regression.",
    "Appendix CNELS/BPS Merged Data File Methodology Report Overview The National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/94) data set is a rich source of data on the relationship between high school experiences and early postsecondary outcomes.",
    "The two datasets share a fairly extensive set of common variables describing the background characteristics of sample members.",
    "In addition to official NCES publications, NCES staff and individuals commissioned by NCES produce preliminary research reports that include analyses of survey results, and presentations of technical, methodological, and statistical evaluation issues.",
    "With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report.",
    "First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention.",
    "The statistics in this report are estimates derived from a sample.",
    "Statistical significance was determined by calculating t values for differences between pairs of means or proportions and comparing these with published values of t for two-tailed hypothesis testing, using a 5 percent probability of a Type I error (a significance level of .05).26 Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: Er -E2",
    "Using the merged NELS/BPS data set, one can project who among the high school class of 1992 received financial aid in their first four years of undergraduate education and the amount that they borrowed.",
    "The BPS:90/94 sample member's postsecondary outcome variables were then attached to NELS:88/94 sample member #1's record.",
    "It was constructed using second follow-up parent questionnaire data; data from earlier survey waves were used if data were missing.",
    "Table C6 presents actual persistence and attainment rates for both BPS:90/94 and NELS:88/94 students and proportions of students according to their timing of postsecondary education enrollment, enrollment status, sex, raceethnicity, and SES in three types of postsecondary education institutions.",
    "However, because the present study examined projected persistence and attainment rates and the methods used to analyze the data were basically descriptive in nature, this study can only suggest conclusions about actual attainment rates and persistence rates.",
    "(See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.)",

    "(See appendix B for details on the multivariate methods used here.)",
    "Comparisons were made in this report only when p<.05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family.",
    "For example, respondent S, was assigned a disturbance term to his/her F3QWT as in equation 1.6 above.",
    "It is calculated by the DAS and produced with the correlation matrix.",
    "These two data sets share a fairly extensive set of common variables describing the background characteristics of sample members.",

    "It is based primarily on student-reported data.",
    "institution F3SEC2A1 Frequencies for this variable were created with F3QWT.",
    "These variables were either items taken directly from the NELS or BPS surveys or they were derived by combining one or more items in these surveys.",
    "Therefore, to isolate some of these associations, a multivariate analysis was conducted on these data.",
    "Note: the status of academic year of 1993-94 (PER9394R) was not considered in making this vari- The NELS:88/94 and BPS:89/90 linkage file was created to provide a set of variables from the NELS and the BPS datasets that would allow inferences to be made about the students in one dataset, based on the characteristics of students in the other survey.",
