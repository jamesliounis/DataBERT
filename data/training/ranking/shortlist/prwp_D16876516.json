    "In this study, we extend the empirical methodology applied by Tanzi and Davoodi (1997) , and Bird, Vazquez, and Torgler (2004) .",
    "When we compare these new results with the ones reported in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it can be seen that the number of observations increased from 884 (covering the period of [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] to 1322 (covering the period of 1994-2009); corresponding to an almost 50 percent increase.",

    "See for exampleTanzi and Davoodi (1997),Bird et al.",
    "When we compare these results with the correlation values reported in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , which covered a shorter time period and a smaller sample of countries, it can be seen that the correlation between tax revenues and all other variables drops; it is especially true for GDP per capita.",
    "When we compare the findings of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) and the ones reported in Table 5 , it can be seen that Canada is a new developed country in the low-effort, low-collection group.",
    "This section also compares the new results with the ones reported in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , which was covering a shorter time period.",
    "When we compare these new results with the ones reported in Table 2 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it can be seen again that GDP per capita is less significant and has lower estimated coefficients now.",
    "When we compare the findings of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) to the ones reported in Table 5 , it can be seen that all new countries come from the high-effort, high-collection group.",
    "Similar to the case in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , we re-index each of these measures in this paper such that lower numbers indicate a higher bureaucracy quality or lower corruption.",
    "This paper employs a cross-country study to estimate tax capacity from a sample of 110 developing and developed countries during 1994-2009 and the two sub-periods of 1994-2001 and 2002-09 .",
    "When we compare the findings of the previous paper with the ones reported in Table 5 , it can be seen that Australia appears as a (new) developed country in the high-effort, high-collection group.",
    "See the country classification section of the paper for the list of countries, which have changed their tax-effort and tax-collection locations with the extended time period analysis(1994-2003 versus 1994-2008).22 This fact has been also emphasized in andGupta (2007).",
    "(2006) , who use a similar specification, test the presence of an endogeneity problem by applying a 2-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) approach and calculating Hausman Chisquare test statistics.",
    "For example, while the estimated coefficient of the corruption index was only -0.560 in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it is now -1.273 and statistically more significant.",
    "al., 2005; Piancastelli, 2001 ).",
    "As reported in Table 1 , the estimated coefficients have the expected signs and they are mostly statistically significant.",
    "When we compare the country classification reported in Table 3 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , focusing on 1994-2003, to Table 5 below (extended period from 1994 to 2009) , it can be seen that the classification of most countries is stable.",
    "The estimation results are reported in Table 3 Panel A.",
    "The data points for the years of 1994, 1998, 2003, and 2009 are reported in the following figures.",
    "Average values of the variables for each country are reported in Table A1 in the Annex, while overall averages and other descriptive statistics are reported in Table A6 in the Annex.",
    "As presented in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , both of these countries were classified in the low-effort and low-tax-collection group.",
    "Note: See Table A7 in the annex for details.",
    "It can be interpreted as follows: when the institutional institutional Table 1",
    "SeeTable A2in the Annex for detailed definitions.16 SeeLe, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) for detailed information on variables and their expected effects on taxes.",
    "Our dataset includes 110 developing and developed countries and covers the period of 1994-2009.",
    "Panel A: Population growth used as proxy for demographic characteristic Panel B: Age dependency used as proxy for demographic characteristic Note: The estimation technique is panel OLS with regional and time dummies.",
    "Since the data for the size of shadow economy are limited, the total number of observations drops to 840 from 1322.",
    "But, as indicated in and endorsed by Musgrave (1987) and Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , this measure is more suitable for studies focusing on countries with similar economic structures and at the same level of income.",
    "While the estimated coefficient of income was around 2.2 in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it is only 1.11 in the traditional tax specification; and it gets even lower and insignificant (0.503 and 0.002 with bureaucracy index and corruption index, respectively) when the institutional variables are included in the specifications.",
    "(1975) and Stosky and WoldeMariam (1997) .",
    "In the literature the taxable capacity and the tax effort of countries have been estimated using regression analysis, focusing on possible determinants of taxes.",
    "Panel A in each table presents the results obtained from the specifications with population growth as a proxy for the demographic characteristics of countries, while Panel B includes agedependency ratios instead of population growth.",
    "The higher significance and magnitude of the estimated coefficients of the institutional variables in the new results support this argument.",
    "As was the case in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , the same estimation techniques are used to calculate the capacity of countries in total fiscal revenue (tax plus non-tax collection) generation, which is named as fiscal revenue capacity, and their effort in revenue generation, named as fiscal revenue effort.",
    "When we compare the descriptive statistics reported in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) to the new results obtained with an extended dataset from 1994 to 2009, it can be seen that tax revenues increased by 1.5 percentage points on average; total fiscal revenues increased by 1 percentage point; trade openness increased by 4 percentage points; population grew 0.4 percentage point higher; agriculture values added became lower by 3 percentage points; and both bureaucracy quality index and corruption index improved by 1 index point.",
    "See Table A2 for the definitions of the variables.",
    "See World Development Report (1997),World Bank Global Monitoring Report (2005), The United Nations report on Financing for Development(2002), The UN Secretary-General's Report to the Preparatory Committee for Financing for Development(2002).",

    "t-statistics are reported in parenthesis.",
    "1994-2009 1994-2001 2002-2009 In general, the results support the previous papers' findings, determining the factors affecting of tax and fiscal revenues.",
    "The averages between 1994 and 2009 are reported in the first columns, while the averages belonging to 1994 to 2001 and 2002 to 2009 are presented in the following columns.",
    "One potential problem in using this methodology would be the possible endogeneity and/or dual causality problem associated with institutional variables (bureaucracy index and corruption index in this paper) and tax revenues.",
    "The results confirm the ones presented in Bird (2007) , Fox, et al.",
    "Panel A: Size of shadow economy (in % of GDP) used instead of agriculture value added Panel B: Share total consumption in GDP is added Note: The estimation technique is panel OLS with regional and time dummies.",
    "With the new dataset, the total number of observations for tax revenue increases from 982 to 1,437, corresponding to almost 50 percent improvement.",
    "A simple correlation matrix among these variables indicates the expected signs (see Table A5 in the Annex).",
    "In each panel, columns (1), (4) and 7represents the regression on traditional tax (includes only demographic and macroeconomic indicators)."
