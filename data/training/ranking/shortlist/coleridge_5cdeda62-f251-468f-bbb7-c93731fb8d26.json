    "Our analytic plan, for the current paper, was conducted across three complimentary phases as follows:\n(1) A series of descriptive analyses were conducted to present an overview of the key sociodemographic characteristics of the entire sample (N = 1989) for the baseline data of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study.",

    "These results are presented in Table 2 , modelled on that of McBride et al.",
    "Table 3 displays summary statistics regarding the housing conditions and composition of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study respondents (N = 1989).",
    "2013; Lee and Kim 2019; Rutter and Brown 2017; Spitzer et al.",
    "However, efforts were made post-data collection to assess the degree of representativeness within and across the UK nations.",
    "In order to assess the representativeness of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study sample to the UK general population, it was compared to data from the UK Census 2011 for adults aged 18 years + .",
    "2020; Gardner and Moallef 2015; Maunder 2004; Tsang et al.",
    "At the time of writing, this is the largest known data collection exercise on COVID-19 and mental wellbeing in NI.",
    "At present, the data collection is nearing completion and a separate paper will be published in due course outlining the methodology and research findings regarding this.",
    "This will allow readers to determine areas where the sample data approximates and thus represents the UK general population and areas where particular sociodemographic may be over-and/or under-represented.",
    "2012; Burdzovic and Brunborg 2017; Lee et al.",
    "As such, a more diverse UK sample was collected in relation to country of residence and at the time of writing, this is the largest known data collection exercise on COVID-19 and mental wellbeing in NI.",
    "Previous literature has demonstrated the excellent psychometric properties of the GAD-7 across various clinical and non-clinical populations (Kertz et al.",
    "Table 1 displays the key sociodemographic characteristics across both the overall sample (N = 1989) and by each nation.",
    "It is also important to note that the data pertaining to the current study is modest in nature as compared to some ongoing data collection efforts in the UK (Fancourt et al.",
    "WHO) and were reviewed by several academics before being included in the study.",
    "Previous research supports the psychometric validity of the scale across a range of diverse populations (Kliem et al.",
    "Furthermore, details of the measures utilised in the baseline survey and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are presented.",
    "Table 4 displays summary statistics regarding keyworker classification for the entire sample (N = 1989) and by each nation.",
    "Indeed, the topics covered within the survey were empirically derived, based on previous epidemic and pandemic research and matched many of the research priorities previously mentioned.",
    "Specifically, the sample was compared by UK country of residence, gender, ethnicity, economic activity, household composition, age and education level.",
    "For the purpose of this paper, we focus on all measures included in the baseline data as completed by all participants.",
    "The primary aim of this paper is to report the study protocol and the resultant sociodemographic characteristics of the participants of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing baseline survey.",
    "Future research should strive to collect data allowing crossnation comparisons within the UK.",
    "The purpose of the current study was to provide a technical overview of the design and procedures involved in initiating the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study.",
    "were covered in the initial baseline survey and followup surveys.",
    "The DERS-SF was developed from the original 36-item scale (DERS, Gratz and Roemer 2004) .",
    "2020; Gardner and Moallef 2015; Tsang et al.",
    "Of note, we did query Note: a n = 3 participants in the Scottish sample had missing data across these variables and were therefore excluded; b n = 2 participants in the N.I sample had missing data across these variables and were therefore excluded; c Participants could choose more than one pet and n = 5 participants has missing data across the entire sample for this question 'how worried people were about the ability of the health system to care for coronavirus patients if the situation worsens'.",
    "However, a crude comparison to the Census data suggests that employed individuals and students were oversampled, while those who are unable to work or are retired were undersampled.",
    "All participants involved in the current study were recruited via a social media campaign or via Prolific panel data, each of these options requires the participant (1) to opt in first of all and (2) have access to an internet connection and equipment to take the survey online.",
    "A wealth of previous literature has demonstrated the excellent psychometric properties of the PCL-5 across various populations (Blevins et al.",
    "(3) The sample distributions of key sociodemographic variables were examined in comparison to recent UK population distributions (gleaned from census data) by UK nation of residence; these were age, gender, ethnicity, economic activity, and household composition.",
    "The total response rate was 2501 and after several exclusions were applied concerning data quality control (please see above methods section) the final effective sample size was 1989 participants.",
    "Additionally, while the utilisation of online survey methods was deemed the only safe way to gather such data on a large scale amidst a pandemic and has the added benefit of increasing accessibility to those groups who would be difficult to access via other means (Wright 2005) , it is also important to mention that our sampling strategy may result in self-selection bias (Bethlehem 2010) .",
    "Furthermore, it is also important to note that small differences in the numbers of deaths recorded are present depending on where and when the data were sourced.",
    "2020; Asmundson and Taylor 2020; Blakey and Abramowitz 2017; Jungmann and Witth\u00f6ft 2020) .",
    "The COVID-19 Psychological Well-being Study was designed as a rapid data collection exercise across the UK population.",
    "In recognising this, a team of leading mental health scientists published a position paper detailing a number of mental health research priorities for the UK in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "A number of limitations are important to consider in the context of the current study.",
    "(2020; preprint) , an accurate comparison of household composition was not achievable from the NI Census data.",
    "Additionally, psychometrically valid and frequently used measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD were included in the study which may aid future comparisons.",
    "Given the nature of the pandemic, the researchers were responsive to COVID-19 topics of public and scientific interest and inserted additional topics into future waves of data collection; for example attitudes to a COVID-19 vaccine (if one was to become available) and problematic drinking behaviours.",
    "Our secondary aim was to provide a clear and concise account of the data that has been collected across the UK population and sub-divided by UK nation (England/Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland).",
    "This knowledge was based on reliable and trusted sources such as Public Health England, the National Health Service, and the World Health Organisation.",
    "As noted by McBride et al."
