  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "Source: Authors' calculations.",
    "The data in table 2 are drawn from an analysis by Langhammer (2005) and reflect the same methodological approach as in table 1, i.e.",
    "Source: Author's definitions.",
    "Source : EBRD Transition Report, 2004.",
    "The data span the period 1990-2004.",
    "Therefore we also present a ranking of all countries jointly, using the same data as in table 5, which takes account of the information hidden by the averages (see also Annex Source: EBRD (2004) .",
    "The data used in figure 1 are averages of the country scores over time at the group level.",
    "Annex table 2 reports the sectoral breakdown of the summary indicators reported in table 1 -health, transport and cultural services tend to be among sectors where the fewest commitments are made.",
    "These data cover the most recent proposals to the extent that they were officially published and are not just snapshots of current trade negotiations as debated in the media.",
    "Thus, the data suggest that new WTO members do more than old ones and that EU accession status does not imply a country will make deeper GATS commitments.",
    "Table 3 displays the GATS commitment indices for these 4 sub-groups of transition economies, using the same methodology as in tables 1 and 2.",
    "Annex table 1 provides detailed information on how the qualitative information displayed in the GATS schedules is translated into index scores.",
    "Table 6 ranks countries -not groups -according to their GATS commitment index and reports their most recent EBRD index score as well as the average EBRD score for the period as a whole (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) .",
    "Table 6 also provides information on the correlation between timing of WTO commitments and actual policy (reform) measures.",
    "Comparing the averages with the most recent EBRD scores reveals that there is divergence between the country groups in the sense that the difference between the index for groups (d) and (a) in 2004 is greater than it is for the whole period.",
    "Determining whether and which of these two possible explanations applies in each of the countries concerned is beyond the scope of this paper, but is clearly an important question for further research.",
    "Descriptive statistics are generated on the extent to which EU members (EU-15) made market access and national treatment commitments in the GATS.",
    "However, insofar as our finding is not simply a reflection of the underlying data weaknesses that affect the level and change over time of the indices, there may be significant limitations to the relevance of the WTO for small (poor) countries as a commitment device.",
    "1 51.9 58.7 54.5 18.4 45.9 Standard deviation 3.2 3.0 6.1 3.1 1.8 3.2 4.3 9.2 2.4 3.1 4.7 4.9 2.0 Mean 50.2 66.6 60.5 2.4 50.9 67.2 65.5 4.6 50.5 66.9 63.0 3.5 46.0 * \"EU\" is an artificial benchmark schedule that ignores country-specific factors.",
    "Comparing the 2004 and the average EBRD columns reveal a difference between groups (a) and (b) and groups (c) and (d).",
    "Source: EBRD (2004) and authors calculations based on GATS schedules.",
    "The pre-Doha level of commitment for the EU-15 as a whole was 47 percent (top of last column of table 1) when measured as an average across the 8 (2 times 4 modes) \"cells\" for which commitments can be made for each of the 155 sub-sectors distinguished in the GATS.",
    "The second group is composed of countries that are relatively open in \"theory\" (as revealed by their GATS indices) and practice (as measured by the EBRD indices).",
    "For example, it is not clear whether our finding is a reflection of the methodology underlying the indices used, noncompliance with multilateral commitments, or the limited commercial relevance of the type of commitments that are required under the GATS.",
    "If so, it is clear from the trends in actual policy as reflected in the EBRD indices that GATS commitments are a rather weak reed on which to base claims of lock-in or credibility.",
    "However, in assessing possible explanations for the observed pattern of GATS commitments, account needs to be taken of explanatory factors such as geographic proximity to a large market (the European Union), the size of the economy, and engagement in the EU accession process.",
    "What the index does do is provide one -arbitrary -way of weighting commitments and allowing cross-country comparisons, thus permitting an assessment of the degree to which there is uniformity in GATS commitments across EU members.",
    "For comparison purposes it is helpful to start with mapping the commitments of the transition economies to those of the EU-15.",
    "What follows begins with an aggregate analysis of the extent to which GATS commitments by the four country groups match actual policies.",
    "The Annex to this paper summarizes the criteria that qualify countries for the top score.",
    "If we use the 2004 EBRD index instead of the average over time, the same finding obtains.",
    "The ability of the GATS to promote liberalization on a reciprocal basis has been questioned in the literature (see, for example, Hoekman and Messerlin 2000) .",
    "This finding also holds if we do not use the average EBRD index of actual policy -which may be \"biased\" insofar as these are countries where reform may have started late, and, as noted above, they acceded to the WTO towards the end of the 1990s or later.",
    "However, our third finding suggests the conventional wisdom may need to be revisited in an important respect as it assumes that multilateral disciplines are applied.",
    "The index ranges from 1(little progress) to 4.3 (most advanced implementation of reform agenda) and has been compiled on an annual basis for the 1990-2004 period.",
    "The numbers in parentheses following each of the EBRD columns are the rankings based on the average and most recent EBRD scores, respectively.",
    "This implies that there is information to be extracted from the level of GATS commitments: deeper commitments can be used as a signaling device.",
    "However, the large differences across the countries concerned in the extent of their GATS commitments may provide information on the \"type\" of government and the perceived need or desire to signal this to the markets.",
    "Essentially the index measures the success of policy on the basis of privatization of state-owned monopolies, liberalization, and progress in implementing a supporting legal, institutional and regulatory framework.",
    "Section 3 assesses trends in the actual policies pursued by the transition economies, and compares these to the index of GATS commitments.",
    "The transition economies on which this paper focuses are a very heterogeneous group of countries.",
    "Figure 1 reports data on the \"quality\" of actual service sector policies and reforms in the four country groups.",
    "While this might be part of the explanation, a comparison of rankings based on the apparent depth of GATS commitments and the average level at which the countries concerned bound their goods tariffs reveals that the (non-EU candidate) countries with high levels of GATS commitments tend to have the lowest average level of bound tariffs (Table 7) .",
    "The question explored in this paper is the extent to which trade agreements were used as focal points or commitment devices for service sector policy reform.",
    "Table 4 summarizes the patterns in the commitments made by the 16 transition economies.",
    "Table 1 presents an assessment of currently applicable GATS commitments for the EU- 15.",
    "Our interest is in part to determine whether there are common or consistent differences between the set of countries that were and that were not EU accession candidates, and more specifically, given that the EU is a deep integration agreement, whether the WTO could play a similar role as a focal point/lock-in mechanism as the EU for those countries where EU accession is not in the cards.",
    "Moreover, although there is greater commonality among the set of transition economies than would be the case for a random sample of countries, similar values do not necessarily imply similar levels of openness, as no effort is made to map commitments by sector across countries.",
    "Before discussing GATS commitments and the actual policies of transition economies, we focus on the EU schedules of services commitments in order to provide a baseline for comparison purposes.",
    "group (d)) so far, i.e., the countries where such multilateral monitoring is most needed."
