    "Using a combination of satellite altimetry data from NASA, recently available in situ Argo float data from the US NOAA and numerical modeling, this TC was studied in great detail.",

    "2007b) was shown to reduce the track errors, thus providing better input data to the storm intensity models because the intensity forecasts largely depend on the track forecasts.",
    "Since the GOES data are available only at the initial time, they have little impact on the forecast beyond 36 h. Thus, nearly all of the improvements at the longer forecast intervals are due to the TCHP because that input is averaged along the storm track.",
    "In the following sections, we present current research progress in three TC basins.",
    "The average improvement of SHIPS due to the inclusion of the TCHP and GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) data reaches up to 3 % for the 96 h forecast (Fig.",

    "2012), a parameter that represents the ocean heat anomaly contained in waters warmer than 26\u00b0C, has been shown to reduce the error in intensity forecasts of tropical Atlantic hurricanes when used as a predictor in statistical prediction methods (Shay et al.",

    "The goal of this manuscript is to summarize some of the current efforts carried out by the international community to monitor the upper-ocean thermal structure that impacts the TC intensity in major TC regions, with emphasis on cyclones that reached the coast and caused coastal storm surge and inundation.",
    "c Pre-Rita TCHP map under the 'with warm eddy encountering' scenario, as derived from the observed SSHA in (a).",
    "Although not as large as for the sample of category-5 hurricanes alone, this result indicates that the TCHP input has improved the operational SHIPS forecasts, especially at the longer forecast intervals (Goni et al.",
    "SHIPS is an empirical model that employs a multiple regression method to forecast intensity changes out to 120 h. The 2011 version of SHIPS includes 25 predictors, mostly related to atmospheric conditions (Mark DeMaria 2011, personal communication).",
    "2 Upper-ocean thermal structure and TC intensity The role of the subsurface thermal structure in TC intensity has been recognized for a long time (Leiper and Volgenau 1972;Holliday and Thompson 1979).",

    "2011;Lin 2012), it is also key to understand the air-sea interaction during the passage of a cyclone, not only in terms of the sea surface temperature, but also of the upper-ocean thermal structure (UOTS).",

    "The coloring in the track indicates the intensity of the TC according to Saffir-Simplson scale Since 2004, an operational satellite-altimetry-based TCHP analysis product, referred to as Oceanic Heat Content, was implemented at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) (Mainelli et al.",
    "These well-tested grids incorporate the unique bay/river configurations and water depths of each area into their digital representations.",
    "Thus, the ocean's cooling and resulting negative TC intensity feedback was reduced and there was 300 % more energy available from air-sea sensible and latent heat fluxes to fuel Nargis' sudden intensification (Lin et al.",
    "d TCHP map under the 'without warm eddy encountering' scenario, that is, based on the climatological condition during Rita's intensification from category 1 to peak strength was mostly between 500 and 1,200 Wm -2 .",
    "10c), which shows that in the presence of warm ocean eddies, TCHP could have reached *80-90 kJ cm -2 , a more than 30 % increase as compared to the non-eddy encountering scenario, that is, under normal climatological conditions (Fig.",

    "2011), which will ultimately be useful for storm surge model initial conditions.",

    "The accuracy of the SLOSH model predictions of storm surge strongly depends on the quality of the forecast guidance data provided by the US National Hurricane Center Fig.",
    "In recent years, ultra-high-resolution (1-6 m) bathymetric and topographic data from airborne LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) optical remote sensing instruments, in addition to high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs), have been incorporated into the SLOSH basin-building process.",
    "However, the UOTS could not be monitored with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to address the issue until the introduction of satellite altimeters in the 1990s (Fu et al.",
    "The intensification of TCs is caused by the interaction of many complex mechanisms that include TC dynamics, upper-ocean interaction and atmospheric circulation (Gray 1979;Holliday and Thompson 1979;Merrill 1988;Emanuel 1999;Emanuel et al.",
    "In this region, a well-mixed upper-ocean layer has proven to be a more effective means of assessing oceanic regimes for TC studies rather than SST fields alone.",
    "More notably, one can observe that in the 'without warm eddy' scenario, from 12 UTC 21 September, the flux supply dropped to zero.",
    "For example, the depression that formed on May 10, 2003, intensified to a TC as it travelled over an anticyclonic eddy with a positive SSHA value.",
