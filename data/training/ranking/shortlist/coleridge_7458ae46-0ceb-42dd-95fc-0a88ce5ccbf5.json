    "Additional Contributions: Natalie L. Marchant, PhD, provided helpful discussion about the study.",
    "Analyses were performed using statistical software (SAS software version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Inc).",
    "Moreover, the associations observed for WMHs and FDG-PET, measured for different brain regions, were based on data sampled over time.",
    "In total, 203 patients with baseline data that included FDG-PET and MR imaging were available for analysis, with decreasing numbers at different follow-up stages ( Table 1) , for a total of 844 observations.",
    "25 Five regions of interest (ROIs) were identified through a literature search of regions most frequently cited in differentiating patients with AD and healthy control subjects.",
    "A repeated-measures design was used to account for the multiple time points when patients were evaluated during the study, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-patient correlation.",
    "When the analysis was restricted to those with available CSF-A\u03b2 data, similar results were observed for relationships between WMHs and glucose metabolism, with almost identical coefficients (model 2).",
    "This is one of the first studies to examine these associations in a large sample of the same patients.",
    "Although the sample was reduced as a result, the estimates of the associations were comparable with those based on the full sample.",
    "Fitted data from the model estimates in Table 3 and Table 4 are shown in Figure 1 for converters and in Figure 2 for nonconverters.",
    "The mean FDG-PET counts were extracted from each ROI and divided by a pons-vermis reference region.",
    "Therefore, the number of patients available for analysis differed depending on the set of biomarkers examined.",
    "By contrast, greater CSF-A\u03b2 (per 10-pg/mL increase) in these same patients ( Table 4 ) was associated with increased temporoparietal metabolism (model 1 coefficient, 0.005; P = .03).",
    "Availability of different measures in the same patients, which included a quantified measurement of WMHs, allowed for multimarker comparisons, while fewer comparisons were possible in previous studies.",
    "Although the distribution of WMHs was characteristically skewed, its relationship with FDG-PET in the different brain regions was linear (data not shown).",
    "Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of interest.",
    "26 In the present study, CSF-A\u03b2 was used as an indirect, quantitative measure of amyloid pathology.",
    "Baseline distributions of study variables were compared for patients with MCI who converted and who did not convert to AD in the 3-year study ( Table 2) .",
    "Details about the measurement of hippocampal volume and determination of ApoE4 genotype are available in previous studies.",
    "Other covariates, including age, sex, and educational status, were used to describe the study sample.",
    "As such, the investigators within ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI or provided data but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this article.",
    "However, adjustment for these variables (eg, depression) could have led to overadjustment of the models because depression may mediate the effects of WMHs on cognition and potentially brain metabolism.",
    "In other words, the study findings may more accurately reflect the underlying relationships of these associations based on changes occurring with progressive white matter disease and its metabolic effects over time.",
    "Therefore, the regression coefficients from the models represented the associations of WMHs with temporoparietal and frontal metabolism (relative to temporoparietal).",
    "An average of these pons-vermis-referenced ROI mean counts was used to create a single temporoparietal FDG-PET composite measure.",
    "Despite its potential limitations, this study contributes substantially to the existing literature with regard to the associations between AD and vascular pathologic substrates and brain metabolism.",
    "These regressions were repeated to examine the association of CSF-A\u03b2 with the same FDG-PET measures.",
    "Although the association was not significant in the restricted group (ie, model 4), it was found to be larger and significant (0.036; 95% CI, 0.006-0.066) after the exclusion of an individual with comparatively low CSF-A\u03b2 (<50 pg/mL), low temporoparietal metabolism (<0.80), and high WMHs (1.3% of total brain volume).",
    "a For consistency, 3 participants (1 converter and 2 nonconverters), whose records consisted entirely of WMHs of 2% or greater and were excluded from the results given in Table 3 , are not included.",
    "Table 3 gives estimates of the associations of WMHs with FDG-PET in different brain regions in converters and nonconverters.",
    "19 Further details about exclusion criteria and study protocols (eg, MR imaging review) applied in ADNI are given elsewhere.",
    "8 Nevertheless, it is possible that the exclusion of these variables may have resulted in biased estimates from residual confounding.",
    "We restricted the analysis to those patients with at least 2 years of follow-up data (data not shown).",
    "The independent variables of the models included age, WMHs, and an interaction of WMHs and an indicator variable to denote the brain region measured with FDG-PET in the outcome (ie, 0 for temporoparietal and 1 for frontal).",
    "However, although more WMHs were negatively associated with frontal metabolism, more WMHs were positively associated with glucose metabolism in the temporoparietal regions in both the larger study group (model 3 coefficient, 0.051; P = .001) and the CSF-A\u03b2 restricted group (model 4 coefficient, 0.023; P = .14) ( Table 3) .",
    "DESIGN AND SETTING Cohort study among the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative clinical sites in the United States and Canada.",
    "Details of CSF collection and processing are given elsewhere.",
    "Patients with MCI were selected for the present study and included those with FDG-PET imaging.",
    "In converters and nonconverters, the analysis was aimed at quantifying the association of WMHs and FDG-PET measured in different brain regions.",
    "However, to avoid potential end point effects that high WMH values could have on regression estimates, WMHs were restricted to less than 2% of total brain volume, where approximately 8% of observations had WMHs of 2% or greater.",
    "We investigated the follow-up difference that was observed for nonconverters and converters with respect to the findings.",
    "The study was approved by institutional review boards of all participating institutions.",
    "This study did not control for certain factors that may have partly contributed to the findings.",
    "A composite measure of frontal metabolism for each patient was created by averaging FDG-PET means across these regions.",
    "Structural MR images (1.5 T) were acquired at multiple ADNI sites based on a standardized protocol.",
    "Compared with estimates based on WMHs from a single time point (eg, baseline assessment only), the estimates from this study may better represent biologic changes concomitant with brain aging and age-related brain disease.",
    "These results support the hypothesis that WMHs, as a measure of vascular pathology and vascular burden, are associated with frontal lobe dysfunction rather than dysfunction in those brain regions more closely linked to AD neurodegeneration.",
    "In summary, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that markers of AD and vascular pathology operate simultaneously to affect metabolism in different brain regions.",
    "Distributions differed significantly between groups and in expected directions for markers typically associated with AD, including CSF-A\u03b2, ApoE4 status, hippocampal volume, and FDG-PET (temporoparietal region).",
    "2, 8, 9 It has been hypothesized that WMHs may be directly related to Alzheimer disease (AD)."
