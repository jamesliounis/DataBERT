    "Despite several drawbacks, the statistical power afforded by the relatively adequate size of this subsample, in combination with the newness of the survey and its detailed focus on the critical period of early childhood, makes the ECLS-B data one of the best data sources currently available for research on teenage fathers and their children.",
    "This study set out to use recent, nationally representative data to identify ways in which having a teenage father matters for children.",
    "Future research, using data that have a stronger set of background measures from before men became fathers, needs to work to disentangle the complicated causal relationships among teenage fatherhood, social disadvantage, and marriage.",
    "Future qualitative research could address some of the empirical puzzles identified in this study's descriptive findings.",
    "The sample was selected using a clustered list frame sampling design based on births registered in the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics system.",
    "(2006) for more information on these assessments.",
    "Our multivariate regression models, reported in Table 2, examined whether each of these domains explained the effect of having a teenage father on children's cognitive and behavior scores at age 2.",
    "See West (2007) for a discussion of the ECLS-B father surveys as compared with other data sources on fathers.",
    "Birth certificate information was used when available, with the following reports filling in any gaps: ECLS-B's constructed paternal age measure, father survey reports, and mother interview reports.",
    "To retain as much data as possible for descriptive analyses, missing cases were deleted listwise within each individual bivariate comparison, resulting in varying Ns for each row of the tables.",
    "It is important to acknowledge that the three domains interact with each other in influencing children's outcomes, as the literature cited below illustrates.",
    "Although the level of nonresponse is a limitation of this data set (West, 2007), as with many other sources of information about fathers, nonresponse bias analyses conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics suggested that there were not many differences between respondents and nonrespondents to the father surveys that would lead to nonresponse bias (National Center for Education Statistics, 2005).",
    "This study used the first two waves of data, from when the children were about 9 months (unweighted SD = 1.9 months, range = 16.1 months) and 24 months (SD = 1.3 months, range = 21.4 months).",
    "We report significant differences at the p < .10 level, but because more cautious readers may prefer to focus only on results that are significant at p < .05 and below, we label marginally significant findings in the text.",
    "We used the t-scores, which adjust for children's age at assessment by comparing them with the distribution of scores for others their age, in descriptive analyses.",
    "We used all three of these data sources to construct information about the life situations of children and their biological fathers.",
    "Coley and Chase-Lansdale (1998) noted that more research needs to be conducted in this area.",
    "We conducted our own analyses comparing various groups of nonresponding fathers with respondents on three key sociodemographic measures from Wave 1 mother reports: child's household socioeconomic status (SES), father's years of education, and father's race (White vs. non-White).",
    "Involvement with the child was represented by a scale averaging 12 items asking how frequently fathers engage in activities with the child, such as eating meals, playing games, and brushing teeth (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .87).",
    "In a review of the literature on low-income fathers, Nelson (2004) noted a need for more research about fathers' influences on their children's well-being.",
    "Our multivariate analyses used important domains of variables identified in the bivariate analyses to examine whether they explained why having a teenage father compromises children's early development.",
    "For example, Hawkins et al.",
    "These response rates are comparable with the overall sample's (see above).",
    "Because few past surveys have been able to capture large enough subsamples of teenage fathers and their children to allow for meaningful analysis, identifying these diverse experiences using recent nationally representative data is an important first step in directing future research.",
    "Previous research has demonstrated the importance of material resources for understanding the educational outcomes of teenage mothers and fathers (Mollborn, 2007), but more research is needed on measuring resources that adolescent fathers typically provide to children.",
    "Third, the size of our subsample of teenage fathers who responded to the father questionnaire sometimes limited the power of our significance tests.",
    "Future research needs to disentangle selection factors that influence the marital status and socioeconomic context of these children's households from the effects of these factors themselves.",
    "Coley and Chase-Lansdale (1998) noted the importance of conducting further research on the relationship between father-child bonds and child outcomes.",
    "Findings in this section are drawn from the left side of Table 1.",
    "This may be in part because of sample size (the subsample of about 150 teenage fathers was divided into two roughly equal groups), but many of the means are so similar that a somewhat larger sample likely would not have resulted in statistical significance.",
    "Conversely, there were much higher proportions of non-Hispanic African Americans, Native Americans/Alaska Natives (p < .10), and men reporting multiple races among teen fathers than among adult fathers.",
    "Little past research on this relationship is available.",
    "This finding echoes Toledo-Dreves, Zabin, and Emerson (1995), who found that nonresident teenage fathers were frequently involved in child care.",
    "Table 1 documented five child health and development measures that were significantly related to having a teenage father.",
    "For example, Whitbeck et al.",
    "Descriptive analyses compared means for all variables for teenage fathers versus adult fathers, while accounting for weighting and complex survey design using Stata statistical software.",
    "There is a considerable psychometric literature on the advantages and limitations of various ways of measuring development at these ages.",
    "Nelson (2004) noted that mothers' reports of objective measures such as this one often agree with fathers' reports, which implies that they might be relied on when father reports are absent.",
    "The developmental outcomes measured in the ECLS-B data are based on 60 minutes of one-on-one assessment based on reputable and widely used assessment measures in child development, and they are intended to provide a reasonably comprehensive picture of each child's age-appropriate developmental progress.",
    "This study suffered from several important limitations that are typical of quantitative research on teenage fatherhood.",
    "Finally, fathers' reports of being a better than average father were constructed from a single question about which category \"best describes how you feel as a father.\"",
    "Breaking the coresident fathers into married and cohabiting groups might shed further light on the issue, but the numbers of married teen fathers were too small for meaningful descriptive analysis.",
    "Before discussing findings for each of these in turn, we begin by describing differences between the two groups for sociodemographic variables.",
    "In Table 1, the two domains of fathers' influences on children that differed between teenage and adult fathers most consistently and in the expected direction were the child's household context and the father-mother relationship (operationalized as coresidence and marital status).",
    "In one study, Furstenberg and Harris (1993) analyzed teenage mothers' children from the Baltimore Study, many of whom had also been born to an adolescent father.",
    "Household SES was constructed by ECLS-B from the primary parent interview and includes household income and the mother's and father's or resident partner's education and occupational prestige.",
    "Replication weights were provided to make responses to the father surveys representative of children born in 2001 whose fathers lived with them or had regular contact with them.",
    "It is important to note that the average adolescent father in this data set did not have a high school degree, which is often considered to be a minimum requirement for attractive employment opportunities (Upchurch & McCarthy, 1990) and likely affects the resources teenage fathers can provide.",
    "Using a nationally representative sample, it tracked children throughout this early developmental period, using both parent interviews and direct child assessments.",
    "In terms of the direct influence of household context, fathers' material support has been positively linked to children's outcomes in past research (Argys, Peters, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998; for a review, see Nelson, 2004)."
