    "In one such study, Kohannim et.",
    "The presented framework has broad applicability to data analysis studies involving heterogeneous data sources, both in terms of modalities and dimensions.",
    "Data Preprocessing: All the baseline and screening T1 weighted, bias-fieldcorrected and N3 scaled structural Magnetic Resonance Images were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.",
    "The major contribution of this article is the ability to extract, in order of relevance, the disease-characterizing patterns from multiple imaging modalities.",
    "We adopt a well known methodology for regression called Partial Least Squares (PLS) [9] [10].",
    "The corresponding clinical test score, the CSF-biomarker data and the APOE genotype information were also retrieved.",
    "To make pattern analysis robust, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction to represent this high-dimensional data in terms of a few features, specifically selected to best explain factors relevant to dementia.",
    "Table 1 reports the details about the subject demographics, diagnosis, apoe carrier status and future conversion status.",
    "We adapt the PLS methodology for the purpose of extracting relevant features from the combination of shape and 3D-SSP data supervised by the clinical scores such as MMSE, ADAS, CDR and clinical cognitive status that are treated as global measures of dementia.",
    "The PLS problem is given by:\nThe subsequent directions are found by removing the component extracted (deflating the data) both in space, M and the clinical response space, Y as:\nThe solution to this covariance maximization problem is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the cross covariance matrix.",
    "This data-driven formulation finds the optimal combination of these high-dimensional modalities that best characterize the disease progression.",
    "The FDG-PET data was processed to get 3D-SSP as detailed in Section 2.",
    "The baseline subjects that had all the clinical, APOE genotyping, FDG-PET imaging and MRI imaging data from the ADNI database comprised of a total of 242 individuals.",
    "edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf function can be measured using functional imaging modalities, such as [\n18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET).",
    "al [4] combine FDG-PET-derived numerical summaries, MRI-derived volume measures, CSF biomarkers, APOE genotype, and subject demographics for the task of discriminating MCI from AD.",
    "Note that the efficient implementations of solution to the PLS via SVD uses the Gram matrix of inner products of the data.",
    "al [3] offer a comprehensive review of this ongoing research.",
    "Corresponding statistical maps of Z-scores, p i (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N), are generated in comparison to cognitively normal control subjects (\u03bc age = 69.6\u00b1 7.7).",
    "As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.",
    "The challenge for predicting conversion is to combine these heterogeneous data sources, some of which are high-dimensional (MRI and PET) and some low-dimensional (clinical, CSF, APOE carrier), by selecting features that optimally weight the relative contribution from each modality.",
    "Besides APOE carrier status, the above analysis was also done after adding log transformed CSF-biomarkers: A\u03b2-42 and ptau 181 concentration, which reduced the study sample-size to only: 29 NL, 36 AD and 59 MCI.",
    "The structural and functional information extracted from two imaging modalities results in a feature space with much higher dimension than the population size.",
    "The focus of this work is to assess the combined predictive capability of this model for early detection of conversion of MCI to AD by using only the information available at baseline.",
    "The supervised PLS dimensionality reduction is applied on combined imaging data of AD and NL subjects.",
    "We use Partial Least Squares as a supervised dimensionality-reduction technique to fuse the weighted combination of the two imaging modalities together with the clinical information.",
    "The proposed methodology is evaluated using the LDA, its quadratic variant-Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and SVM as binary classifiers.",
    "Recent studies have examined the role of different classes of biomarkers, cognitive measures, and genetic risk factors either in combination with a single imaging modality or independently for predicting conversion from MCI to AD [1, 2] .",
    "We quantify the structural variability of the individual by registering the atlas to each image via estimating geodesic diffeomorphic transformations.",
    "Tissue-wise intensity normalization for white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid was performed using the expectation maximization based segmentation followed by the piecewise polynomial histogram matching algorithm.",
    "In other words, the classifier is trained on the AD and NL but is used as a \"recommender\" for the test MCI subject.",
    "While there are several ways to look at this problem, we present here a formulation of the classifier supervised by the AD group and healthy control group (NL).",
    "Also, the optimal combination of PET and shape performed much better as compared to only using PET or anatomical shape information irrespective of the choice of classifier used (Fig.",
    "Although classifiers utilizing kernel approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) could work in the high-dimensional imaging feature space, for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), dimensionality reduction has to be performed.",
    "If we denote the Gram matrix of momenta by G S and that of 3D-SSP by G P , the fused Gram matrix for the product space weighted by \u03b7 can be written as:\nThe projection scores, thus obtained by PLS, have combined information of anatomical shape and glucose metabolic activity that is used as features together with low-dimensional modalities such as genetic biomarkers of APOE carrier status and/or CSF biomarker available from spinal tap tests.",
    "Despite evidence for the predictive capability of individual biomarkers, cognitive measures, or neuroimaging data, relatively little attention has been given to combining information available from multiple imaging modalities with the biomarkers [4] .",
    "In this article, we present a unified framework to combine the high-dimensional information available from multiple imaging modalities, anatomical shape atrophy (derived from MRI) and neuronal hypometabolism (derived from FDG-PET), with other low-dimensional biomarkers, such as APOE carrier status, A\u03b2-42 and ptau 181 concentration.",
    "We propose a modeling strategy using supervised feature extraction to optimally combine highdimensional imaging modalities with several other low-dimensional disease risk factors.",
    "The geodesics emanating from this estimated atlas towards each subject are estimated by warping\u012a to each of the baseline subjects to give initial deformation momenta, \u03b1 i (0)(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N) [7] .",
    "A convenient and natural machinery for generating diffeomorphic transformations is by the integration of ordinary differential equations (ODE) on underlying coordinate space, \u03a9 defined via the smooth time-indexed velocity vector fields v(t, y) :\ngiven by the solution of the ODE Following [6] , we use a group-wise approach and build the mean populationbased atlas,\u012a.",
    "The Partial Least Squares can be interpreted as a supervised dimensionality reduction technique based on latent decomposition model.",
    "ADNI FDG-PET images are co-registered to the talaraich atlas space using Neurostat [8] .",
    "To extract the anatomical shape features, the unbiased atlas,\u012a is constructed from the preprocessed baseline MR brain images on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) [6] .",
    "QDA performed the best with accuracy of 66% and AUC of 0.72 at \u03b7 = 0.8.",
    "We observed that the shape component dominated the model with up to 80% contribution compared to only 20% contribution from the PET component, irrespective of the classifier used.",
    "We find directionsm in the combined product space of imaging modalities, M, and directions\u0177 in the clinical response space, Y, that explain their association in the sense of their common variance.",
    "The imaging features are then combined together with low-dimensional biomarkers such as APOE carrier status to train the binary classifier for AD/NL classification.",
    "The motivation is to discover new imaging biomarkers and use them in conjunction with other known biomarkers for prognosis of individuals at high risk of developing AD.",
    "Since the anatomical shape and metabolic activity are two separate measures obtained from independent imaging modalities, we combine the two spaces to form a product space that defines the combined space of imaging modalities, M such that:\nThe factor, \u03b7 is interpretable as a relative weight when both the modalaties are normalized to have unit variance.",
    "The accuracy of prediction of MCI to AD conversion and the associated \u03b7 is given in Table 2 .",
    "Preprocessing the MRI involved skull stripping and registration to talairach coordinates as a part of the ADNI preprocessing pipeline."
