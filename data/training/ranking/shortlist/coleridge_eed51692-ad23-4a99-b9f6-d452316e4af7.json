    "1 Online appendix table A.1 summarizes the key independent variables for both datasets both overall, and separately by gender.",
    "Most relevant to the current study, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that time spent on homework has a positive impact on boys' high school grade point averages (GPAs), which are a measure of both cognitive and non-cognitive ability.",
    "The demographic controls are summarized in panel A of online appendix table A.2.",
    "Specifically, we use two complementary, nationally representative datasets to test the hypotheses that female and high-SES secondary students spend more time on homework, on average, than their male and less-advantaged counterparts.",
    "Similarly, table\nA.5 reports estimates of a variety of models that address the limited nature of the to-coded, count nature of the ELS homework variable: Type 1 Tobit, two-limit tobit, Poisson regression, rightcensored Poisson regression, and interval regression (Raciborski, 2011; Wooldridge, 2013) .",
    "(2002) used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS88) to show that time spent on homework had positive effects on math and science test scores.",
    "The current study uses time diary data from the American Time Use Survey ( conditioning on spending at least some time on homework.",
    "Analyses of the ATUS time-use data utilize a number of other controls that are commonly used in time-use regressions (e.g., Gershenson, 2013; Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) .",
    "Finally, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that high school boys' time spent on homework has a positive effect on the probability of attending college.",
    "Several studies have also investigated the relationship between homework habits and educational attainment, many of which use NELS88 data.",
    "The two datasets are broadly similar, which is unsurprising given that both are nationally representative cross-sections of similar time periods.",
    "Panel B of table table A .2 reports the percentage of respondents who participated in three specific activities on the diary day that might \"crowd out\" homework time (Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) : organized extracurricular activities (including sport and non-sport activities), childcare (of household children), and work for pay (outside of household).",
    "Panel A of Table 1 summarizes the homework time of students in the analytic sample both overall and by gender.",
    "Therefore, to provide a fuller understanding of the size and nature of gaps in homework time, we augment the ATUS analysis with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which is a nationally representative survey of tenth-grade students in 2002 that was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics.",
    "596-604) , which can be directly compared to OLS coefficient estimates, are reported in online appendix table A.4.",
    "We document robust, statistically significant one-hour weekly gender gaps in secondary students' non-school study time using time-diary data from the 2003-2012 waves of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and transcript data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS).",
    "Columns 2 through 5 of table 5 present estimates of the same interaction specification on different subsamples to further investigate potential sources of the gender gap in non-school study time.",
    "A large empirical literature has investigated the relationship between time spent on homework and children's cognitive and non-cognitive development; see Cooper, Robinson, and Patall (2006) for a review.",
    "More generally, these results contribute to the literature on gender gaps in non-cognitive skills.",
    "This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, daily activities, and state FE in columns 3 through 6, respectively.",
    "Table 5 reports estimates of extensions of equation (1) that interact the male indicator with the academic achievement variables and estimate the model separately by SES categories.",
    "Appendix Table A Notes: Means are weighted by sampling weights that adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.",
    "Importantly, the results presented in table 4 and in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap is not driven by differences in course taking or academic ability, but rather by within-group differences in effort.",
    "adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.",
    "The implications of the limited nature of the ELS homework variable are discussed in the methodology section.",
    "To further investigate the underlying causes of gender gaps in non-school study time we estimate versions of (1) Reassuringly, sensitivity analyses reported in the online appendix confirm the robustness of the OLS estimates.",
    "The APE reported in this table are directly comparable to the OLS coefficients reported in column 1.",
    "The ATUS collects a 24-hour retrospective time diary from one individual over age 15 per household from a subset of the Current Population Survey (CPS) sampling frame and links each diary to demographic, employment, education, and income data from the CPS for all members of the diary respondent's household.",
    "All subsequent analyses are weighted to adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection and survey nonresponse.",
    "Accordingly, we begin our analysis using time diaries collected by the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).",
    "In analyses of both datasets, we combine households earning less than $20,000 in one ''low-income household'' category, which is in line with the U.S. census poverty line for a family of four during this time.",
    "This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, academic achievement, coursework FE, and school FE in columns 3 through 7,",
    "Online appendix table A.3 summarizes the coding scheme, the specific courses assigned to each categorical indicator, and the percentage of the sample enrolled in each course category.",
    "Similarly, age is one of the most important predictors of children's time use (Zick & Bryant, 1996) , so respondent's age is included in the time-use regressions.",
    "The current study connects the literatures on homework, non-cognitive skills, and academic success by furthering our understanding of the magnitude and determinants of gender and SES gaps in secondary students' time use outside of the traditional school day.",
    "As a result, the gender gaps identified in analyses of the ELS data likely represent lower bounds of the true gender gap.",
    "The statistical significance of mean differences between male and female respondents is tested using t tests.",
    "For example, Jacob (2002) used time spent on homework as a measure of non-cognitive skills and found that gender differences in non-cognitive skills had positive effects on college completion.",
    "The analytic sample for the current study is restricted to the 5,909 respondents aged 15 to 19 who selfreported being enrolled in high school at the time of completing the time diary and for whom basic demographic variables are observed.",
    "Notes: Means and standard deviations [SD] are weighted by sampling weights that adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection.",
    "A statistically significant eight percentage point gender gap is also observed in homework participation, as 46% of girls did at least some homework on the diary day compared to only 38% of boys.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.",
    "Accordingly, the current study investigates the distribution of SES and gender gaps in effort put forth outside the traditional schoolday, as measured by secondary school students' non- The ATUS time diaries are the ideal instruments with which to measure homework time, as time diaries are relatively robust to social desirability bias (Juster & Stafford, 1991) and contain information on participation in other activities that may \"crowd out\" homework.",
    "These complementary datasets provide consistent evidence of gender gaps that are explained neither by differential rates of participation in extracurricular activities, childcare, and part-time jobs, nor by differences in advanced course taking, past academic achievement, school quality, or cognitive ability.",
    "This is done both to increase the precision of estimated gender and SES gaps and to control for potentially confounding omitted variables.",
    "The estimates reported in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap in homework time is mostly due to the time use of high-performing and high-math ability students, as males in the top quartile of the distribution of math ability perform about twenty minutes less homework per week than similarly talented females.",
    "These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the SES gap and the reversal of the gender gap in college completion are at least partly attributable to corresponding SES and gender gaps in non-cognitive skills that originate in childhood and persist into young adulthood (Jacob, 2002; Lundberg, 2013) .",
    "Accordingly, we augment the ATUS analyses with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which contains the high school transcripts of tenth graders in 2002 as well as students' performance on standardized math and reading tests.",
    "Specifically, the \"Research/Homework\" time-diary activity code includes non-school time spent doing required (assigned) homework and research, time spent doing homework and research for personal interest or fulfillment, waiting time associated with homework and research, and miscellaneous time associated with homework and research.",
    "However, the richest model specification (column 7) that conditions on school FE all but removes the SES gap in weekly homework time."
