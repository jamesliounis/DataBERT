    "Input from the study's expert Technical Review Panel (TRP), cognitive and usability testing (used to refine the survey questions, maximize the quality of data collected, and provide information on issues with important implications for the survey design), and findings from the BPS:12/17 pilot test helped finalize the full-scale data elements.",

    "Staff matched and downloaded student financial aid data from CPS, which houses and processes data contained in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms.",
    "BPS:12/17 student-level data are compiled from student surveys and matches to governmental and administrative databases.",

    "Table 10 shows the distribution of the 35,540 sample members determined to be eligible at the start of BPS:12/17 data collection, by study member status and survey response status, and identifies groups that were fielded (included in data-collection activities with an objective of obtaining a complete survey) in BPS:12/17.",
    "The institution-level response rates shown in table 57 are the percentage of institutions that provided sufficient data to select the NPSAS:12 student-level sample; these rates are presented and discussed in the NPSAS:12 data file documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014, table 3, p. 11).",
    "After the conclusion of data collection, BPS staff imputed missing data for selected variables included in the restricted-use research file and in the public-use data available through the NCES online application PowerStats.",
    "In turn, the BPS:12/17 sample was created from the BPS:12/14 sample, using additional data obtained during the BPS:12/14 data collection.",
    "Data-collection procedures were similar to those used in BPS:12/14.",
    "As mentioned by Tourangeau and Yan (2007), few studies have examined the validity of data reported using forgiving wording, and results from those have been mixed, showing no difference or small increases in response to sensitive questions (Abelson, Loftus, and Greenwald 1992;Catania et al.",
    "Some data elements were only administered to certain subgroups of respondents, as also noted in table D-1.",
    "The discussion also outlines the sampling methods used in the first follow-up data collection, BPS:12/14.",
    "26 StudentTracker data were requested toward the end of data collection to ensure availability of the most up-to-date student identifying data for the match.",
    "They were also calibrated to weighted estimates obtained from NPSAS:12 and population estimates obtained from the IPEDS:2010-11 Fall Enrollment file (EF2011A) and the IPEDS:2011-12 Student Financial Aid and Net Price file (SFA1112).",

    "Specifically, a study member was any sample member who NPSAS staff determined to be eligible for the study, per the criteria delineated in section 2.1.2, and who had, at a minimum, valid data from any combination of sources for the following variables: \u2022 student type (undergraduate or graduate); \u2022 date of birth (or age); \u2022 sex; and \u2022 at least 8 of the following 15 variables: -parent education.",

    "Table 53 shows the variables used for the poststratification, the values of the control totals, and the average weight-adjustment factors for each variable for the cross-sectional weights.",
    "Prior to sampling, NPSAS statisticians matched all students listed as potential FTB students within the NPSAS:12 sampling frame to NSLDS and CPS records, simultaneously, to determine if they had a federal financial aid history predating the NPSAS year (earlier than July 1, 2011).",
    "Due to the expense of sending all cases to NSC, statisticians used information from BPS:04/06 to identify institutional strata that had high falsepositive rates in this previous BPS cohort.",
    "Additional data collected during the administration of BPS:12/14 were available for use in preparing the sample for BPS:12/17, which was a subset of the BPS:12/14 sample.",
