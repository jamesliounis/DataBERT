    "A compilation of the key analytical and empirical contributions appears inGrossman (1996).17 See, for example,Chenery, Robinson, and Syrquin 1986).",
    "See, for example, the surveys byTybout (1992).",
    "There are currently efforts to construct a more recent table.29 which are described in the next few sections.30 In this model, we assume that imports used as raw materials are of the OGL variety and not subject quantitative restrictions; imports in final demand are competitive with domestic outputs and are subject to quota restrictions.",
    "Some details at a more disaggregated level follow.",
    "Table 4 .1 presents the results.",
    "The authors note in the preface that the study was substantially completed in 1973.2 The year 1987-88 refers to the fiscal yearApril 1, 1987-March 31, 1988 3Aksoy and Ettori (1992) report, for example, that the effective rate of protection was as high as 585 percent in the capital goods sector.",
    "Table 3 .2 reports results for the high premium case.",
    "Much of this analysis is aggregative in nature and does not easily lend itself to the level of disaggregation required for the issues investigated in this paper.",
    "The information thus assembled includes detailed revenue data on customs and excise taxes that describe the complex tax and trade protection system in India, an input-output table updated to 1987-88, and household expenditure information from the 38th round of the National Sample Survey (see Appendix B).",
    "By way of background, Table 3 .4 provides information regarding the subsectoral structure of the economy.",
    "The data set is compiled from disparate sources that were made mutually consistent with one another and with the national income figures for 1987-88.",
    "The implementation of the disaggregated model is as follows.",
    "Section 3 answers the policy questions posed in the introduction to the paper using data pertaining to the pre-reform period.",
    "On the other hand, more sectorally disaggregated studies, such as those of Ahmad and Stern (1987) and Jha and Srinivasan (1989) for India, make strong macroeconomic assumptions, notably that of fixed factor prices.",
    "Data for those years are used as inputs into the model and its predicted outcomes for the principal macroeconomic aggregates are expressed as a proportion of GDP 2 6 .",
    "The framework developed in Section 2 and used to simulate trade liberalization and fiscal adjustment in Section 3 was calibrated on a data base predating the 1991 reforms.",
    "The data base, thus updated to 1992-93, may be used to simulate the effects of a range of policy reforms.",
    "The differences lie mainly in the special features developed for this study and in the addition of a disaggregated version for sectoral analysis.",
    "More generally, the paper, while primarily shedding light on economic reforms in India, develops an empirical methodology at different levels of aggregation for economies attempting a transition to outward orientation and closer integration into the world economy in the face of revenue and balance-of-payments constraints.",
    "Excellent overviews of the new growth literature are also found inAghion and Howitt (1998) andBarro and Sala-I-Martin (1995).",
    "On the one hand, exercises of the computable general equilibrium type -- Dahl, Devarajan, and van Wijnbergen (1986) , Mitra (1992) , Dahl and Mitra (1989) --have focused on the macroeconomic consequences of tax design and reform but at the expense of sectoral detail.",
    "Earlier work with a similar framework,Mitra and Tendulkar (1986), suggests that these are not significant in tariff reform at a broad level of aggregation.",
    "Section 4 compares the outcomes generated by the model with actual developments in the major macroeconomic aggregates occurring up to the year 1992-93 and updates the model to that 5 See, for example, Corden (1985) .",
    "The results offer insights into a pattern of adjustment polar to that described in Simulation 2.",
    "Table 3.7 with Table 3 .2 allows a determination of the range of outcomes bracketed by the fiscal adjustment/fixed current account and the no fiscal adjustment/variable current account cases.",
    "Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1975).",
    "The 1978/79 table was the last official matrix constructed at the time of study.",
    "We conclude by suggesting that the approach developed in the paper has the potential for providing broad indications of the economywide and sectoral consequences of pursuing the unfinished agenda of reforms still facing policy makers in India and indeed more generally in other developing countries.",
    "The greater openness to the external environment induced by the reform increases total factor productivity (TFP) by about 1 percent; its significance may be judged by comparing columns (1) and (2) where the latter takes away the productivity-enhancing effect of outward orientation.",
    "Government Consumption Table 2 .3 also reports the breakdown of Government consumption by sector.",
    "i 8 The derivation appears inKubo, Robinson, and Syrquin (1986).",
    "Relaxation of quantitative restrictions therefore leads to much higher imports, compared to a low (10%) import premium case presented in Table 3 .3.",
    "A more complete procedure of the kind described and implemented inMitra (1994) would have required updating all the parameters and exogenous variables of the model.",
    "These objectives are reconciled by the innovative expedient of implementing two models on a common data base: (i) a disaggregated 72-sector (price sensitive) input-output version that makes simplified assumptions regarding certain economy wide relationships; and (ii) an aggregated 6-sector version that pays careful attention to those relationships and can suggest what corrections ought therefore to be made to the results of the sectorally disaggregated analysis.",
    "The values of these variables are treated as parameters of the disaggregated model.",
    "Finally, the framework developed in the paper provides some estimates, based on cross-country relationships, of the productivity improvements and growth consequences that could be expected from greater outward orientation.",
    "By doing so, it was possible to test and obtain some estimates of the savings in computing time and cost when the short-cut in this study, i.e., the method of separate solution of the price and quantity modules, was implemented.",
    "This section provides a heuristic description of the model, which is similar in many respects to the six-sector models developed in Mitra (1994) to examine the economic performance of oil importing developing countries in response to extemal shocks during the seventies.",
    "Whether or not deficits of this order are sustainable requires analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper.",
    "This approach, which is described in Section 2.7 below, retains the simplicity of input-output analysis while allowing technical substitution in response to changing cost conditions.",
    "Inasmuch as a fiscal adjustment would in practice involve a combination of tax increases and expenditure reductions, the resulting implications for the macroeconomic aggregates may be worked out by inspecting columns (1) and (2) in Table 3 .1.",
    "4Available evidence, quoted inKishor (1994), suggests that the premium on import replenishment licenses given to exporters had fallen to around 5 percent in the 1980s, largely due to a shift to a more",
    "For the application to India, however, the data for the 72 sectors were actually made consistent, thus permitting a disaggregated fully general equilibrium model to be solved simultaneously.",
    "This finding is very encouraging since the separate priceand-quantity calculations, in addition to reducing data work, permit a saving of at least a factor of five in mainframe computer time and cost when compared to a full-fledged disaggregated general equilibrium model.",
    "This paper has developed a framework for examining the consequences of a program of stabilization and trade liberalization in India, where fiscal and current account imbalances needed to be reduced in order to launch the economy on a path of durable growth.",
    "Column (1) of Table 3 .1 reports the results of attaining the deficit target through an increase in the average level of the Union excise-tax-cum-CVD rate, while holding investment (public and private) as well as public consumption, constant in real terms.",
    "The disaggregated version of the model assumes the productivity index for the specific industries within each group to assume the same value as that for the group as a whole.",
    "The choice of production structure was conditioned by the absence of reliable estimnates of substitution parameters and the simplification required by disaggregation.Krueger (1981), for example, argues that a Cobb Douglas formulation is a reasonable choice.",
    "S See Neary and Roberts (1980) .",
    "Given new product prices, exports and private consumption are estimated as described in the previous section."
