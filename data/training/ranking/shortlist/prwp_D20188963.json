    "The paper is structured as follows.",
    "See next section on data and methodology for description of the data sources.",
    "We use data from Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey (HIECS) over time.",
    "Section 3 presents the data and empirical methodology.",
    "The paper uses data from two main sources: (a) the Egypt DHS for 2000 and 2008; and (b) (iii) birth not being assisted by a skilled health professional; (iv) child not having a postnatal checkup within two months after birth; and (v) immunizations within one year after birth.",
    "Where denotes the row vector of variables representing n circumstances and a corresponding column vector of parameters.",
    "Second, the paper draws on the concept of the human opportunity index (see Barros et al., 2009; Molinas et al., 2010) .",
    "It draws on the concepts and ideas developed in the World Development Report (WDR) 2006: Equity and Development, WDR 2007: Development and the Next Generation, and the methodology developed in the recent and growing literature on inequality of opportunity (see, for example, John Roemer, 1998; Barros et al., 2009) .",
    "First, the paper analyzes the relationship between early risks and outcomes and circumstances at birth and compares the distributions of outcomes across circumstance groups.",
    "The paper also assesses the changes in inequality of opportunity in the 2000s and the factoring driving the trend.",
    "To measure the contributions of different circumstance variables to inequality of opportunity, we employ the decomposition procedure proposed by Shorrocks 2012 To illustrate, note that the value of D is dependent on the set of circumstances considered.",
    "In a study in Bangladesh, Anwar et al.",
    "Mohan and Pathak (2009) use a similar methodological approach to measure the inequalities in access to maternal care services and child immunization.",
    "The decomposition method outlined earlier allows us to estimate the contribution of each circumstance to the estimated D-Index.",
    "The following logistic regression is fitted using DHS data:",
    "Before delving into the analysis of inequality of opportunity, here we provide a descriptive analysis of the relationship between the desirable outcome variables and the circumstance variables described Our analysis shows that there has been a significant reduction in the percentage of births not attended by skilled health professionals and of births not taking place in health facilities during the 2000s (Figure 2) .",
    "Where D is a dissimilarity index that measures the inequality in access rates to a given basic service for groups defined by circumstances, compared with the average access rate to the same service for the population as a whole (Barros et al.",
    "In a study investigating the correlation between socioeconomic status and malnutrition among children under the age of 5 in South Africa, Zere and McIntyre (2003) analyzed household income and expenditure survey data and found that stunting and wasting were most highly concentrated in the poorest regions of the country.",
    "From the estimation of the above regression one obtains estimates of the parameters { }, denoted as \ufffd , \ufffd, where m denotes the sample size.",
    "The impact of adding a circumstance A can be given by:",
    "Using the predicted probabilities () and sample weights ( ), we can find the predicted overall coverage rate ( \u0305 ) and D-index ( \ufffd ) as:",
    "Section 2 presents a brief literature review of the early risk factors and associated health and education outcomes for children.",
    "Sections 4 and 5 present the main results and discussions, while Section 6 concludes the paper.",
    "Pathak and Singh (2011) use bivariate analysis, poor-rich ratio and concentration indices to evaluate the trends for malnutrition.",
    "The analysis uses severall tools, including comparison of the distributions of early risks and outcomes across circumstance groups; estimation of the human opportunity index; measurement of the relative contributions of circumstances to inequality of opportunity; and decomposition of changes in inequality of opportunity and factors driving them over time.",
    "The set of immunizations considered in this section of the paper are: BCG, DTP (1, 2, and 3), Polio (1, 2, and 3) and Measles.",
    "Once the level of HOI for each outcome variable is estimated for 2000 and 2008, it is possible to decompose the changes in the index by scale and distribution effects and try to understand the drivers of the estimated change over time (Barros et al., 2009) .",
    "The first component of HOI, , the coverage rate, can be calculated using household survey data.",
    "This implies that two countries that have identical coverage or average access rate of a particular service may have different HOI if the access to that service on one country is more concentrated among children of a certain set of circumstances.",
    "The Shapley decomposition reveals that regional variables explain the largest share of the variations in access to improved water at home and in whether the child is registered.",
    "Finally, the paper assesses the changes in inequality of opportunity in Egypt during the 2000s and the factors driving the observed trends.",
    "(2008) employs multivariate logistics regression to examine inequities in the use of maternal healthcare services and finds that significant inequalities due to asset ownership, area of residence, and parental education.",
    "This is done by decomposing the changes in HOI by scale and distribution effects, given the index is additively decomposable (Barros et al., 2009) .",
    "A similar study undertaken in Brazil analyzed the prevalence of child malnutrition in relation with income and basic services redistribution policies (Monteiro et al.",
    "In this paper, we use two variables available in the DHS and that are important for determining and supplementing iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: (i) whether the mother has had blood tests during her pregnancy; and (ii)",
    "In a setup where a coalition of players produces certain gains (where some players may contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess different bargaining power), Shapley Value provides a unique solution that satisfies all participants.6 The Shapley decomposition has two useful properties: The first is symmetry, ensuring that the contribution of each factor is independent of the order in which it appears in the initial list or sequence of factors.",
    "Third, the paper attempts to measure the relative contributions of each circumstance to total inequality of opportunity.",
    "For instance, Egypt's children and youth, representing more than one-third of the country\u00b4s population, face a higher risk of poverty than the general population; and the gap has widened during the past decade (World Bank, 2011).",
    "It also highlighted that inequality was highest along racial lines: among the white population, no significant inequities were observed, while nonwhite children from metropolitan areas displayed the highest levels of stunting.",
    "For instance, the HOI for the indicator on births taking place at a health facility that increased from 38 to 63 between 2000 and 2008, around 18 percentage points of the increase can be attributed to the scale effect (services becoming more widely available and being utilized), while about 8 percentage points is attributable to the distribution effect (services becoming more equitably available across circumstance groups).",
    "While Section 4 looked at the availability of and access to these services and its trends during the 2000s, Educational Attainment by Age Level this section focuses on measuring the degree of inequality in access to these services and how each circumstance contributes to the disparity.",
    "In order to do so, a simple logistic model, linear in the parameters \u03b2, where the event I corresponds to \"whether a blood sample taken from the mother during pregnancy\" and C is the set of circumstances.",
    "Any improvement in the index can be attributed either to an increase in the coverage rate, (scale effect), or a reduction in the index of inequality of opportunity, D (distributional effect):",
    "Where k denotes a circumstance group (group of children with a specific set of circumstances); is the specific coverage rate of group k; is the share of group k in total population of children; and is the numbers of groups defined by circumstances.",
    "D(S) is the dissimilarity index estimated with the set of circumstances S. ( \u222a { 1}) is the dissimilarity index calculated with set of circumstances S and the circumstance C1.",
    "Similarly, D(C1,C2)\u2265D(C1).",
    "Specifically, the paper aims to answer a simple question: what are the chances that an Egyptian child will have adequate access to critical basic services regardless of his or her circumstances at birth, such as gender, place of birth, and family background?",
    "Therefore, the maximum value HOI can take is the average coverage rate by a particular basic service (i.e., ).",
    "Figure 11 presents the decomposition of the changes in HOI into scale and distribution effects.",
    "To estimate the contributions of individual circumstances to total inequality of opportunity, the study applies Shapley value decomposition."
