    "The paper proceeds as follows.",
    "See Auerback and Gorodnichenko (2010, 2012) and Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Vegh (2013).",
    "In all of our regression analysis, we use robust Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors to correct for potential heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation in the lags, and error correlation across panels.",
    "In Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) , they resort to an alternative methodology -advocated by Jorda (2005) and Stock and Watson (2007) -that relies on running a separate regression for each horizon and then constructing the impulse response function.",
    "Table 3 summarizes our results in the 2x2 matrix discussed in the introduction.",
    "Section 2 discusses the data and our methodology that follows the direct projection method mentioned above.",
    "8 The sources of data for government spending and GDP (for both OECD and developing countries) are IFS (IMF), Global Financial Data, Datastream, as well as local sources such as Central Banks.",
    "Given the absence of readily available government spending forecast error data in developing countries, we use -as has been typical in the SVAR literature -quarterly data on seasonally-adjusted real government spending as well as the identifying assumption that while contemporaneous changes in government spending can a\u00a4ect output in the same quarter, the opposite is not true (i.e., it takes output changes at least one quarter to a\u00a4ect government spending).",
    "11 The common practice in this emerging literature (e.g., Owyang Based on the median value of x during expansions and recessions, we capture the median recession using I(:) = 0:7 (and, thus, 1 I(:) = 0:3).",
    "In that case, and while one regime (recession) has a relatively small number of observations, the smooth transition model allows us to e\u00a4ectively pool more information taking advantage of the variation in the degree of a particular regime so that estimation and inference for each regime is based on a larger set of observations.",
    "In a related, but di\u00a4erent, approach, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (AG) (2010) solve the issue of threshold selection by extending early work by Granger and Teravistra (1993) on Smooth Transition Autoregressive models (STAR) in order to accommodate simultaneous equation analysis in a Smooth Transition Vector Autoregressive model (STVAR).",
    "The sample period covers 1970-2011.",
    "(2012), the threshold is estimated from the data but it could still be argued that the selection of the threshold variable itself is arbitrary.",
    "(2012) extend Chan and Tong's (1986) early work on Threshold Autorregresive Models (TAR) to a multivariate setting in order to create a Threshold SVAR (TSVAR) model.",
    "The widely-used identi\u2026cation method of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) in the context of structural vector-autoregressions models (SVAR), which relies on the existence of a one-quarter lag between output and a \u2026scal response, has been called into question by Ramey (2011) on the basis that what is an orthogonal shock for an SVAR may not be so for private forecasters.",
    "The table thus tells us that industrial countries spend, on average, 56 percent of the time in countercyclical states of the world; that is, the sum of cells (1,1) and (2, 2) .",
    "To remedy this, Barro and Redlick (2011) and Romer and Romer (2010) have suggested, respectively, the use of a \"natural experiment approach\"(military buildups in the United States) or a narrative approach for the case of taxes.",
    "In other words, there seems to be, at least for the United States, a non-trivial correlation between orthogonal innovations in an SVAR and private forecasts.",
    "The sample periods covers 1986-2008.",
    "For OECD countries we use semiannual data on seasonally-adjusted real government spending, seasonally-adjusted real GDP, and government spending forecast errors (F E G ) computed as the di\u00a4erence between forecast series prepared by professional forecasters and actual, \u2026rst-release series of the government spending growth rate.",
    "We now proceed to report the estimates of the \u2026scal multipliers for both OECD and developing countries using the four empirical speci\u2026cations just outlined.",
    "Table 4 summarizes our multiplier results for developing countries in the 2x2 matrix discussed in the introduction.",
    "7 8 As discussed in detail in AG (2010, 2012), F E G provides a convenient way to identify unanticipated government purchases, which enables us to appropriately estimate \u2026scal multipliers.",
    "Motivated by the \u2026ndings from Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we now follow speci\u2026cation (4) and look into the possible interaction between recession/expansion and government spending increasing or decreasing.",
    "All the results reported so far refer to \u2026scal multipliers computed for the \"median\" expansion and recession.",
    "On procyclical \u2026scal policy in developing countries, see Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004),Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008), and the references therein.",
    "Our sample includes 52 countries (21 industrial and 31 developing) for the period 1971-2011.4 Of course, the current austerity programs in the Eurozone constitute procyclical \u2026scal policy, which had traditionally been observed only in developing countries.5 We are, of course, implicitly assuming that causation goes from the cycle to \u2026scal policy to tell our story.",
    "A potential solution is the use of non-linear, regime-switching type regressions, which have been used in some studies for the United States and other industrial countries.",
    "For the case of industrial countries, Table 1 indicates that government spending is above the long-term trend 48 percent of the time and below such trend 52 percent of the time.",
    "From a technical standpoint, dividing the classical SVAR regression samples into expansions and recessions could severely compromise the number of observations used in the analysis as well as miss inherent non-linearities in the economy's response to \u2026scal stimulus.",
    "1 2 Although the point estimates of the IRF and multipliers are straightforward to calculate (we use the weighted average of E;h and R;h ), standard errors also need to account for the covariance between E;h and R;h .",
    "For example, cell (1,1) indicates that industrial countries spend, on average, 29 percent of the time in good times with government spending going down.",
    "We follow the single-equation approach advocated by Jorda (2005) In particular, LP (i) can be estimated by single-regression techniques (least-squares dummy 7 The list of OECD countries comprises Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Rep., Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.",
    "As a natural \u2026rst step -and following speci\u2026cation (1) -we compute the cumulative \u2026scal multiplier for OECD countries, which is illustrated in Figure 1 This linear (or single) multiplier provides us with a benchmark to \u2026rst revisit the AG exercise of computing multipliers in expansions and recessions and later examining whether it matters if government spending is going up or down.",
    "To this e\u00a4ect, Figure 6 depicts the multiplier for OECD countries for each of the four pos- Perhaps not surprisingly, the largest multiplier (in the medium and long run) corresponds to category (iv); that is, recession and increase in government spending ( Figure 6 , panel D).",
    "The e\u00a4ectiveness of these \u2026scal packages remains, however, an open question.",
    "As argued above, the most relevant multiplier appears to be the one corresponding to cell (2,1), which is the case of procyclical \u2026scal policy (contractionary \u2026scal policy in bad times).",
    "Figure   10 shows the results for OECD countries.",
    "Finally, we look into the possible interaction between recession/expansion and government spending going up or down in Section 3.4 (for typical expansions and recessions) and in Section 4 (for extreme expansions and recessions).",
    "While, as discussed in section 3.4, our \u2026ndings for typical recessions were consistent with the \"short-run pain and long-run gain\"arguments often heard when considering the implications of austerity packages, this is not the case when focusing on extreme recessions.",
    "The corresponding \u2026gures for a typical and extreme expansion are 0.9 and 3.2 1 1 As in AG (2012), we calibrate = 1:5.",
    "Therefore, Y and We then follow AG (2012) and compute non-linear \u2026scal multipliers in economic expansions and recessions for OECD countries (Sections 3.2 and 4).",
    "(1) by including the underlying elements of speci\u2026cations (2) and 3:",
    "Following AG (2012), I(:) is a transition function for each country that ranges between 0 (largest expansion) and 1 (deepest recession).",
    "In line with AG (2010), however, we sidestep the problems derived from assuming discrete changes in regimes by using a smooth (continuous) transition model.",
    "1 0 For consistency with our methodology for developing countries, we also computed all multipliers for OECD countries using the same frequency and methodology (described below) that we use for developing countries.",
    "12 In Section 4, we will then compare the multipliers obtained under typical expansions and recessions with those obtained under extreme expansions and recessions (i.e., for the cases in which I(:) = 0 and I(:) = 1, respectively).",
    "Since we estimate properties of a given regime using in part information from another regime, our estimates may be biased.",
    "4 Recall that if we de\u2026ne countercyclical \u2026scal policy as being in cell (1,1) or (2,2) inTable 1or 2 (that is, contractionary policy in good times and expansionary policy in bad times), we can see that while industrial countries have spent 56 percent of the time in those cells, developing countries have spent only 36 percent of the time.",
    "Trends were calculated using the HP filter."
