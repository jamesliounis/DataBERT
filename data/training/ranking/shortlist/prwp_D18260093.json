    "Corresponding studies for other major OECD countries by Mork et al.",
    "This paper addresses these shortcomings.",
    "Subsequently, various studies (Hamilton, 1996 (Hamilton, , 2003 Hooker, 1996) found direct measures of volatility to be more powerful in explaining the oil-GDP relationship than oil prices in levels.",
    "Subsequently these findings were confirmed by Burbidge and Harrison (1984) , Gisser and Goodwin (1986) , Mork (1989 ), Ferderer (1996 and others.",

    "Hence, for each country a time series of continuous daily oil prices is obtained, with , where = [June, 1. ,1983; June, 2. ,1983; .",
    "The corresponding estimates (i.e.",
    "For example, assuming there is a shock to ,1 (the first element of ), the effect on the j th variable is given by the first column and j th element of 2 , 1 , 2 , etc.",
    "These results are supportive of the findings from the analysis in previous sections, particularly the impulse response functions (Section 3.6).",
    "This is in line with results by Mork et al.",
    "Blanchard and Gali (2007) for instance show that relying less on oil in industrial production processes has reduced sensitivity in developed countries.",
    "In accordance with these results, further analysis is based on the original realized volatility and once differenced industrial production series (denoted and ) in order to enable meaningful regression results.",
    "This study will therefore be based on monthly data, unlike Guo and Kliesen (2005) and Rafiq et al.",
    "For instance, Figure 8 suggests that domestic oil consumption-production ratios may also play a role in determining the level of sensitivity.",
    "(2001) who study the impact of oil price shocks on Japanese monetary policy and macro-economy; as well as Cunado and Gracia (2005) who conduct cointegration and Granger causality tests for six Asian economies 3 .",
    "However, running similar time series analysis as for the countries in our original sample, results suggest that Norway's economic activity does suffer from increased oil price volatility: The Granger-causality test confirms that oil price volatility has a causal impact on economic activity.",
    "Degrees of freedom are based on 332 observations and respective lag length (selected by BIC).",
    "With respect to the USA it should be noted that the p-value 0.059 is only marginally excessive of the 0.05 significance level.",
    "Based on this, this study employs the Realized Volatility (RV) measure as suggested by Andersen et al.",
    "Enders (2010) advocates forecast error variance decomposition to confirm the results from the above impulse response analysis.",
    "However, as the right panel of Table 6 .",
    "For the purposes of this study, economic activity constitutes the dependent variable and oil price volatility the key regressor.",
    "Table 2 (right panel) presents test statistics for Industrial Production in levels, and first and second differences, while the test in levels allows for a linear time trend and intercept.",
    "The classical approach, such as by Mork (1989) , which considers oil price innovations in levels, fails to remain statistically significant in subsequent sample periods.",

    "Furthermore, a set of 'leaping' economies is selected, namely India (IND), South Korea (KOR) and Malaysia (MYS), as they have experienced immense economic growth throughout the considered data period .",
    "In Table 11 the column FF(%) indicates the hypothesized share of fossil fuels.",
    "Lardic and Mignon (2006) show that standard cointegration is rejected for most of the twelve European sample countries, while asymmetric cointegration is determined to be of major relevance in explaining the impact of oil price shocks.",
    "While this study focuses on renewable energies, nuclear energy is also argued to be an important carbon-free source of energy with various benefits such as being non-location specific and scalable (see Kessides, 2010 , for an evaluation).",
    "While the overwhelming majority of literature in this field uses quarterly data, this study uses monthly data, in order to capture intra-quarter volatility.",
    "Mory (1993) and Lee et al.",
    "where denotes a predictable drift term with finite variance, corresponds to volatility and denotes standard Brownian Motion.",
    "These impulse responses are found to be statistically significant.",
    "At a 10% (or in fact 6%) significance level the null of 'no Granger causality' would also be rejected for the USA.",
    "The (%) column presents the effect on economic activity that the 2008 oil price volatility increase would have had in the given scenario, while the corresponding GDP loss is stated in the '$-Loss' column.",
    "Evidently, there exists a strong correlation between all six domestic pre-tax oil prices, as well as between domestic and global oil prices (cf.",
    "Optimal lag length is determined by the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion, AIC and BIC respectively.",
    "Using the same realized volatility measure, Rafiq et al.",
    "Granger's (1969) causality test investigates whether lags of have explanatory power in forecasting (and vice versa), i.e.",
    "For instance, the USA and India have had significant domestic oil production, which accounted for 46.8% and 38.6% respectively of domestic consumption throughout the sample period.",
    "In order to determine whether the estimated coefficients represent a causal relationship between and , a Granger causality test is applied.",
    "Overall, this paper offers further rationale for implementing policy measures which disconnect a country's macroeconomy from volatile oil markets.",
    "For the purposes of this study it is essential to investigate to which extent shocks to realized volatility explain the -step-ahead IP forecast error variance ( ) 2 .",
    "The GDP loss which could have been avoided in 2008 if only the hypothesiszd renewable energy share had been in place, is stated in the last column (Av.",
    "As both variables have been found to be stationary, the test is based on the standard ( ), with selected according to the Bayesian Information Criterion.",
    "With these results Cunado and Gracia (2005) verify the existence of a significant negative oil-GDP relationship in Asian developing countries -including Malaysia, a net oil exporter.",
    "The BIC determines the optimal model which minimizes the log mean squared error plus a log penalty term, which increases in the number of regressors K; and hence , first and second differences."
