    "In this paper we combine several data sets covering the period 2005-2015.",
    "In order to check the sensitivity of our results to the use of a different data source, we follow previous literature in defining skills measures using the U.S. O*Net database.",
    "(2014) and Michaels et al.",
    "(2003) , Acemoglu and Autor (2011) , Autor and Dorn (2013) and Autor (2014) for the U.S., Goos and Manning (2007) for the United Kingdom, and Goos et al.",
    "Many studies in a similar situation rely on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*Net database, which collects occupation-specific attributes for detailed occupations in the United States.",
    "Results for the 2011-2015 sub-period show some differences with respect to previous findings (Tables 28 and 29) .",
    "Section 5 presents the methodology and Sections 6 to 8 explain the results, distinguishing between the 2005-2010 and 2011-2015 sub-periods, and including some additional estimation exercises.",
    "Section 3 describes the sources of data used in the analysis, while Section 4 describes the main variables.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Our paper is related to three different strands of literature.",
    "This is especially relevant when considering the two subperiods we use in the study.",
    "Their finding is relevant for our study, where the share of households with a computer is used as a proxy for the level of technological development accessible by firms.",
    "The interaction between the instrument and the share of households with a computer is positive and significant in 2005-2010 and significant in 2011-2015 only in column (4).",
    "Finally, using Sakernas information on the share of each occupation in total provinceindustry-year employment, we link the skill measures of each occupation obtained from STEP to the Sakernas database: *",
    "Panel A of Table 2 provides some descriptive statistics on ICT adoption at the household level across the 33 provinces of the country.",
    "There are differences and similarities between the results using the U.S. O*Net database and our previous analysis, depending on the sub-period.",
    "We based this analysis on four sources of data -the Indonesian National Labor Force Survey, the Indonesian National Socio-Economic Survey, the STEP Survey for Philippines, and the UN Comtrade database.",
    "We present the main results for the 2005-2010 sub-period in Tables 26 and 27 for the skills demand model and aggregate labor market indicators models respectively.",
    "By contrast, for the 2011-2015 sub-period the relationship between the trade measure, as well as its interaction with technology, and skills using the U.S. O*Net database are in line with previous estimates.",
    "Dependent variable: 2005 -2010 and 2011 -2015 , Susenas 2005 -2010 , 2015 Philippines STEP survey, and 2011 -2015 , and UN Comtrade database 2005 -2010 .",
    "Our findings can be summarized as follows.",
    "Table 4 presents first-stage results for the two sub-periods we analyze and for different specifications.",
    "These studies include Acemoglu (1999) , Autor et al.",
    "We rely on 2004 O*Net data, the year before our period of analysis, to ensure that the skills measures are not affected by technological advances taking place after that year.",
    "Table A1 in the Appendix provides more details on these variables.",
    "Third, results for the 2005-2010 sub-period are in line with evidence available for developed countries -technology is complementary to analytical and soft skills and is labor-saving.",
    "Several important implications arise from these findings.",
    "Finally, information on computer use at the household level (technology variable) from 2005 to 2015 comes from the Indonesian National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas).",
    "Using this survey, we construct the share of households having a computer in each province and year, which we use as a technology adoption variable in our econometric analysis.",
    "Finally, we use the Sakernas survey to generate variables used as controls in the econometric analysis.",
    "(2003) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) .",
    "For men, a rise in the technology measure is associated with a rise in the unemployment rate (columns 2 and 3 in Table 14) .",
    "2005 -2010 and 2011 -2015 , Susenas 2005 -2010 , 2015 Philippines STEP survey, and 2011 -2015 , and UN Comtrade database 2005 -2010 .",
    "Finally, measurements of trade in goods are taken from the UN Comtrade database from 2005 to 2015.",
    "This result also contrasts with the evidence found for 2005-2010, which was in line with previous findings for developed countries.",
    "Third, we use information from the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) to generate technology adoption variables at the province level.",
    "This is especially relevant when considering the two sub-periods we use in the study -one characterized by a commodity boom (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) and the other one (2011-2015) marked by a decline in export activity that affected the mining and mineral sectors more than manufactures.",
    "For 2005-2010, the relationships between the technology measure and the demand for different types of skills are similar to the results using the STEP Survey (Table 30 ).",
    "We separate the analysis in two subperiods, 2005-2010 and 2011-2015, to account for the change in the weighting scheme introduced in the Sakernas surveys in 2011.",
    "Therefore, our study contributes to the understanding of how technological advances and globalization are shaping labor markets in a developing country context, providing evidence of the impacts on the demand for five different types of skills, and on labor force participation, employment, and unemployment rates, with the results disaggregated by demographic groups.",
    "First-stage results for all robustness checks show significant correlations between the instruments and the value of Indonesian exports and its interaction with the technology variables.Tables are available upon request.",
    "On balance, we decided to use the 2015-2016 STEP survey of the Philippines for our main results and the U.S. O*Net database as a robustness exercise.",
    "In this study we use the share of households with a computer as a proxy for the technological development accessible by firms in each province.",
    "In the STEP survey, the variable we use captures the structured vs. unstructured nature of the job, while in the O*Net database the routine cognitive measure comes from the activity \"documenting/recording information\".",
    "We believe the different results obtained when using the Philippines STEP Survey and U.S. O*Net database can be explained by the different levels and rankings of the skills used in each occupation in these two countries.",
    "First, we use the Indonesian National Labor Force Survey (Sakernas survey) from 2005 to 2015, which collects main labor indicators covering the 33 provinces of the country.",
    "We combine four sources of data.",
    "Panels D and E of Table 2 describe some province and industry characteristics we use as control variables in our econometric analysis.",
    "Finally, for women an increase in the employment rate is associated with an increase in the technology measure (columns 2 and 3 Table 15 ).",
    "Previous literature for developed countries has found that increased use of computers increases the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills and reduces the demand for routine skills (Autor et al., 2003; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos et al., 2014) ."
