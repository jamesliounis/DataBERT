    "This paper describes one such survey.",
    "Until the study described in this paper was undertaken, there was little information available on household demand for improved water services in Nigeria which could help clarify the issues involved in this policy discussion (for an exception, see Reedy, 1987) .",
    "The fieldwork for this study was conducted over a three-day period in July 1987 (this time was spent developing and pretesting questionnaires and training enumerators), and a tenay period in August 1987 (during which the survey work was conducted).4_ The Anambra State Water Corporation made available ten enumerators for the study and an experienced water supply engineer.",

    "For a discussion of the various ways used to test the reliability of the bids, see Whittington, Briscoe, and Mu, 1987, and Whittington, Mujwahuzi, McMahon, and Choe, 1988 .",
    "For example, in perhaps the most carefully conduct2d study of household water expenditures among the urban poor, it was found that the poorest households in Port-au-Prince, Haiti sometimes spend 20 percent of their income on water (Fass, 1988, p. 175) .",
    "When the necessary secondary data are not available, the construction of such a sample frame is simply too time consuming and expensive to be practical for most policy-oriented research efforts in which information is required in a timely manner to support management decisionmaking.",
    "Because of the uncertainty introduced by the lack of a welldefined sample frame, the surveys were designed to include as many cross-checks on the data obtained from the various interviews as possible.",
    "Considerable effort was spent during the period of the fieldwork attempting to obtain the information in the union borehole observers' daily log books; information from the union on its membership and the number of tanker trucks operating daily in Onitsha was also sought.",
    "The data presented in this study show that it is incorrect to imagine that a water authority without central government subventions is without resources.",
    "In addition to the research in Onitsha--part of which is presented in this paper--surveys were conducted in Enugu and in rural areas in collaboration with the Department of Economics, University of Nigeria, Nsukka.",
    "For excellent reviews of the current state of the art, see presents a frequency distribution of the households, willingness-to-pay bids.",
    "Not only did respondents report in the bidding game that they would pay substantial amounts for water from the piped distribution system, but it is clear from the data collected in the questionnaire on current water use practices (and from the study of water vending) that households were already paying a lot for water.",
    "After explaining that the survey was part of a World Bank study, the enumerator read each respondent a carefully-worded statement that was designed to set the scene for the \"bidding game\" in which respondents would tell whether or not they would be willing to pay certain specified amounts for water under certain circumstances.",
    "The lack of a well-defined sample frame is not a problem which is unique to this study.",
    "wanted to know what was going on at the household level in the water sector and needed some empirical investigation and analytical work to find -ut.",
    "Since the results could be cross-checked with information from more than one source, it is possible to be confident about the accuracy of the general picture of water vending in Onitsha which is presented in this paper.",
    "The paper illustrates that a rapid reconnaissance survey of water vending activities and the willingness of households to pay for improved water services can yield valuable inforn tion for water supply planning and unexpected policy insights.",
    "Rather the choice is between information which can be obtained from the kind of surveys carried out in this study (or information which can be obteined from other kinds of fast, relatively inexpensive studies).",
    "The consequence of this lack of a well-defined sample frame is that it is not possible to be as confident in the extrapolation of the findings from the sample to the general population of Onitsha.",
    "A case study of water vending and willingness to pay which was carried out in Onitsha, Nigeria, in July and August 1987, illustrates how such studies can be conducted and what kinds of information they can provide.l",
    "'-he lack of adequate data on household water demand appears to be one of the reasons for these shortfalls.",
    "The necessary detailed, up-to-date population data are not available in most urban areas in developing countries--and particularly in squatter settlements--to implement survey research designs in which every member of the urban population has a known probability of being selected.",
    "None of the surveys carried out as part of this research could be conducted in accordance with rigorous social science research protocols in the sense that it was not possible to construct welldefined sample frames from which to select the respondents.",
    "The volumes reported in this paper were estimated by respondents themselves and should only be considered approximations of actual volumes.",
    "This case study has shown that a rapid reconnaissance survey of water vending activities and the willingness of households to pay can yield valuable information for water supply planning and, in this case, unexpected policy insights.",
    "As illustrated, respondents generally rePorted that they were willing to pay substantial amounts for water.-For example, at a price of N 0.25 per drum (about N 5.4 per 1000 gallons) about 87 percent of the sample households reported that they would connect to the piped distribution system.",
    "Studies such as this are very inexpensive relative to the capital costs of urban water projects, and can provide valuable information for use in the planning and design of water supply projects in developing countries.",
    "Stated more simply, the general manager of the water utility 1/ This paper is the first of several reports based on the findiags of a research project on willingness to pay for wacer in Anambra State, Nigeria, funded by the World Bank and the USAID Water and Sanitation for Health Project (WASH).",
    "However, the general magnitude of the results presented in Figures 6-8 should be correct.",
    "These transactions are summarized in Figures 2 and 3 .",
    "The purpoF of this particular study was to estimate the willingness of households to pay for water so that the state water authority could make a more informed decision on how much to charge its customers.",
    "However, care was taken in sample selection to avoid obvious sources of bias, and all five types of interviews were carried out in all the major districts of the city.",
    "For more information on the tanker truck drivers union, see Appendix, \"Financial Aspects of the Water Vending Business for Different Types of Water Vendors,\" pp.",
    "It is not a limitation of this study per se in the sense that there is no reasonable alternative to the sampling approaches used given the time and budgetary constraints.",
    "The real question for policy makers and managers working in the water sector is thus not whether they would prefer to have more reliable information obtained from studies carried out in accordance with rigorous social science research protocols versus the kind of information provided by the type of rapid reconnaissance surveys described in this paper.",
    "* -water volumes reported in this paper are \"imperial gallons.\"",
    "The estimates of household income upon which these percentages are based are only rough approximations derived frcm answers to questions in the household questionnaire, and some of the estimates at the extremes of the frequency distributions presented in Figures 6-8 may well be due to inaccurate data.",
    "Similarly, the results of this study show that the revenue potential of the ASWC is tremendous, and that the population of Onitsha would be much better served if the ASWC viewed itself as a regulated utility, not as an agency providing a social service.",
    "However, the results of the household survey indicate that people perceive the water available from tanker trucks and small retail water vendors to be better in quality than the water available from the old public system.",
    "At the time of this study people living in these apartments were waiting for the completion of the New Onitsha Water Scheme and often for the extension of the distribution network to their neighborhood.",
    "In order to turn the failure of the previous survey into an advantage, the enumeration team was challenged to show that they could do good work and a sense of \"ownership\" in the study was instilled in the enumerators.",
    "As illustrated in Table Al , the capital costs have been calculated using three different capital recovery factors (0.12, 0.16, and 0.20) .",
    "In this sense, Onitsha was an ideal setting for conducting a willingness-to-pay survey in which the price of water was varied.",
    "The price of water charged by the vendors was effectively an upper bound on the amount respondents would bid for water; respondents were not willing to pay more than the price of water charged by vendors because the water provided by vendors was perceived to be of good quality and was generally readily available.",
    "In the past it has been commonly assumed that households could only afford to pay 3-5 percent of their income for improved water services, so these data on the proportion of household income being spent on water in Onitsha appear extraordinarily high.",
    "At the time of the survey, households in Onitsha were paying water vendors about N 30 million annually (US$7 million).",
    "This New Onitsha Water Scheme was inaugurated in January, i988, soon after the field work for this willingness-to-pay study was completed.",
    "The management of the ASWC was somewhat skeptical about the enumerators' ability to conduct survey work in Onitsha because a few months earlier they had attempted to do another survey and the whole enterprise had collapsed.",
    "Using this bidding game procedure, it was possible to classify each household into one of the following seven groups based on how much the respondent indicated the household was willing to pay per drum:"
