    "This paper contributes to two main literatures.",
    "Summary statistics are provided in Table 1 .",
    "Cox- Edwards and Ureta, 2003, Yang, 2008) .",
    "The most closely related work to our paper is Ambler et al (2014) .",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "We can then combine this with the lab-in-the-field evidence to examine the extent to which behavior in the game predicts take-up of the new product, and to help better understand the likely mechanisms behind any take-up.",
    "Here is the mean outcome (e.g.",
    "Related work by Ambler et al.",
    "Figure 1 shows the CDFs of the total amount remitted under the four choice structures.",
    "This resulted in a sample of 501 migrant workers, who were then administered a baseline survey, and a lab-in-the-field experiment.",
    "The remittance data are from Bangko Sentralng Pilipinas (BSP) and consistent with those also reported by IOM (2010).",
    "The first is very recent literature which examines how migrants respond to changes in information asymmetry and to the opportunity to exert more control over how remittances are used.",
    "In particular, Ashraf et al.",
    "At the conclusion of the survey and experiment, participants were then told about the new EduPay product, provided with some related marketing material and, if they wanted to use this new product, asked to sign two forms: (i) a general information form on the sponsorable student(s) and (ii) an authorization form required by PAPSCU to obtain all relevant information on the student (e.g., their school ID number) from the schools so as to implement EduPay.",
    "The baseline survey collected information on demographic background, labor market status, remitting behavior, and the quality of their relationship with their most closely connected household in the Philippines.",
    "Following the lab-in-the-field experiment, our field team explained the new EduPay product developed with BPI with the help of some marketing material.",
    "Section 3describes the setting, baseline sample, and lab-in-the-field experiment.",
    "Column 4 conditions on remitting at all 2,003 Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the individual level.",
    "The third objective was to examine how use of these features varies with the degree of asymmetric information between the migrant and the recipient.",
    "In the next section we then investigate the extent to which behavior in these lab-in-the-field experiments helps predict takeup of the new EduPay product.",
    "Table 3 presents the results.",
    "Thaler and Shefrin, 1981).",
    "This paper also contributes to a second, related literature, which examines the role of soft and hard commitments on financial decisions.",
    "Column 2 shows this effect continues to hold in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance once we add control variables.",
    "We then examine the extent to which these choices vary according to the information provided to the most connected household in the Philippines.",
    "*, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively.",
    "We include here gender, the number of children in the Philippines, whether the individual has their spouse in the Philippines, whether they have nephews and nieces of school-age in the Philippines, their own education level, whether they have been in Italy longer than the median of 7 years, whether they earn less than the median of 800 euros per month, and the amount they report having sent to the Philippines for educational purposes in the past 12 months.",
    "6 We examine the determinants of take-up via probit regressions of the form:",
    "In the first column we see that individuals who choose to remit more money via the direct payment option during the game are significantly more likely to take up the EduPay product.",
    "This contrasts with the finding of Ambler (2013), but this difference is not statistically significant, and for none of the outcomes can we reject equality of means for the basic, no-label, choice across the different information treatments.",
    "Moreover, the last row of Table 2 shows that for all but one outcome we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equality of the three forms of directing the remittance for education purposes.",
    "The first was to test the responsiveness of total migrant remittances when migrants have the ability to control some of this for education use.",
    "Column 3 shows each 100\u20ac more remitted when given the labeling option is associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of take-up, which is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.",
    "Where X are additional control variables that may be likely to determine the desire of the migrant to remit for education.",
    "Individuals who took part in this exercise were then subsequently offered the opportunity to use a new financial product, EduPay, developed by the authors in collaboration with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI).",
    "This is consistent with the findings of the lab-in-the-field experiment.",
    "In particular, the standard unitary model of the household seems particularly unlikely to hold in a migration context due to information asymmetries and to limits on monitoring within the household (de Laat, 2008; Chen, 2013; Ambler, 2013 , Doi et al, 2014 ).",
    "Table 4 reports the results.",
    "These findings are consistent with recent evidence from other domains suggesting that soft commitments in the form of labeling can change spending and saving behaviors.",
    "We begin by pooling results across the different information treatments and examining how the migrant's willingness to share (remit) money with others in the Philippines varies with the different choices which provide greater or lesser degrees of control over how money is used for education.",
    "Randomization occurred by computer, and was a simple random draw, without stratification, since no baseline data were available to stratify on at the time of assigning questionnaires to different treatments.",
    "Next we examine whether the responsiveness of migrants to the ability to label remittances for education or to be able to directly pay the school varies with the information the most closely",
    "We also see that migrants with children in the Philippines are more likely to sign up for this product, whereas those with lower incomes are less likely to use the product.",
    "The pvalue for testing equality of these effects is 0.127, so we cannot reject that there is no impact of information treatment on the decisions made.",
    "Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the individual level.",
    "Rapoport and Docquier (2006) provide an excellent summary of different theories of remitting, and note that a key feature of remittances is that distance makes informational problems more pervasive and hence strategic behavior more likely than is the case with many other types of transfers.",
    "The third and fourth columns show the association with the differential amount they choose to remit in the game when given the education labeling option.",
    "The second objective was to attempt to unbundle the different features of the EduPay product, in order to determine whether any positive responsiveness to EduPay was driven by the ability to channel funds directly to schools, or whether EduPay simply provided a way for migrants to label that a transfer was intended for education.",
    "We see this is generally true across the different outcomes and tests: appears to be lower when a social excuse is provided for using education labeling or direct payment.",
    "We hypothesized that the willingness of the migrant to use education labels and to directly send money to the school may differ with the information that the most closely connected household receives about the choice the migrant makes."
