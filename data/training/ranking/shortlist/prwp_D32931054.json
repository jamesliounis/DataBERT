    "The paper is organized as follows: section 2 outlines the study's conceptual framework.",
    "The results section first presents the results from the basic model (1) specification applied to the entire sample and conducts the checks for robustness.",
    "The abovementioned studies focus on assessing the determinants of fixed-internet access and usage, many in developed countries.",
    "The study adds to the literature in the following ways: (1) it is one of the first studies to explore determinants of mobile internet adoption in developing countries, (2) it uses nationally representative household-level data that follow a consistent methodology across countries allowing for cross-country comparisons, which is a rarity in the literature, and (3) it establishes a significant relationship between a few demand side variables and mobile internet adoption, which present significant policy implications.",
    "For instance, Srinuan, Srinuan, and Bohlin (2012) use data from Thailand to find that price, the availability of fixed telephony, and individuals' age and location are strong determinants of mobile internet adoption.",
    "However, data from Telegeography show that household fixed-broadband penetration is low (at 13.5 percent) across countries in the sample; thus, such cases should be minimal.",
    "The author may be contacted at rchen5@worldbank.org.",
    "Section 3 describes the data used.",
    "2019; van Biljon and Kotz\u00e9 2007) .",
    "This study exploits a household survey that collects information on information and communications technology access and usage at the household and individual levels in 22 countries in the Global South.",
    "A p-value of 0.7387 of the Pearson chi-square from the Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit test indicates that the model fits the data well.",
    "Furthermore, to detect if any potential observations have a significant impact on the model, model (1) is retested by excluding observations with Pearson residual value more than 2, deviance residual value more than 2, and leverage value more than 3 times the average leverage.",
    "This paper is a product of the World Bank's World Development Report 2021 Team, Development Economics.",
    "Those factors also reflect what the descriptive statistics show to be the main obstacles to owning an internet-enabled phone or using internet, as outlined in the data section above.",
    "Going beyond other microlevel data sets such as the Living Standards Measurement Study and the Global Findex database, this data set collects rich, in-depth information on ICT access and usage from the demand side.",
    "Moreover, since the affordability of an access device is often cited as an obstacle to internet usage, the analysis uses data about a country's average cost of an internet-enabled phone from International Data Corporation (IDC) and constructs a dummy variable that equals 1 if the average phone cost is more than the individual's monthly income.",
    "Model (1) includes the income variable, which is an important explanatory factor for ICT adoption in general according to the literature.",
    "Section 4 lays out the study's empirical strategy.",
    "For instance, Goldfarb and Prince (2008) find that low income, less-educated people spend more time online.",
    "The three think tanks, including RIA (Research ICT Africa), LIRNEasia (Learning Initiative for Network Economies in Asia), and DIRSI (el Di\u00e1logo Regional sobre la Sociedad de la Informaci\u00f3n / Regional Dialogue on the Information Society), conducted the survey separately in 2017/2018.",
    "Education, employment status, and type of electricity are found to be important factors (Aker and Mbiti 2010; Bj\u00f6rkegren 2019; Forenbacher et al.",
    "This is also consistent with the framework proposed by van Dijk (2006) , who argues that there is a cumulative and recursive model of digital technology adoption, starting with motivation, followed by physical/material access, subsequently requiring digital skills and complementary services (such as electricity) to achieve usage, leading to strengthened motivation and increased usage over time.",
    "For instance, income, installation fees, and age are shown to be significant factors predicting fixedinternet usage (Birba and Diagne 2012; Cerno and Amaral 2006; Katz and Rice 2003) .",
    "The surveys are nationally representative, and the data can be disaggregated on the basis of gender, age, location (urban or rural), and income level.",
    "The impact of several alternative modeling strategies is then explored, including disaggregation of the sample by geographic region, and the impact of alternative ways of modeling the influence of income on uptake decisions.",
    "However, such usage can be captured through combining information gained through multiple survey questions regarding whether respondents: (1) have used the internet or not, (2) own a mobile phone, and (3) whether the type of mobile phone they own allows internet access.",
    "Meanwhile, the sign and level of significance of other variables in model (1) remain largely similar (see tables 5 and 3).",
    "Given the rapid pace of change in the ICT sector, analysis is confined to the most recently available data for the year 2017, based on cross-sectional estimation.",
    "Results are slightly different if model (1) is estimated for each region separately (table 4).",
    "Some studies consider the factors affecting fixed-internet access and usage and other aspects of the digital divide.",
    "One strand of the literature argues that psychological attitudes toward ICTs affect their adoption (Srinuan and Bohlin 2011; van Dijk 2006) , while a second strand emphasizes the role of social networks in shaping perceptions and driving adoption, such as membership in occupational, religious, or cultural communities (Al-Jaghoub and Westrup 2009; Andr\u00e9s et al.",
    "To evaluate the validity of model (1), a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test is conducted after the estimation.",
    "(2019) and Hasbi and Dubus (2020) , this analysis tries to estimate the probability of using mobile internet through the following model:",
    "Third, only specific country or regional data are used in the few studies analyzing the demandside factors affecting mobile internet adoption.",
    "This study aims to (1) examine how socioeconomic variables and perception factors affect mobile internet adoption; and (2) compare differences in mobile internet adoption across different countries, regions, and demographic profiles from the demand side.",
    "It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world.",
    "Estimations show that factors affecting the adoption of mobile internet are largely consistent with those that affect other types of digital divides (table 3) .",
    "A Census divides a country into Enumerator Areas (EAs) which roughly have a household density of 200.",
    "Given that the dependent variable is a binary variable, a logit model is adopted for the estimation to predict the probability of an individual adopting mobile internet.",
    "Second, studies on mobile internet adoption tend to focus on the supply side, emphasizing technological aspects such as the efficient compression of images or data delivery (Kim and Kim 2002) .",
    "Within a framework commonly used in the literature to assess the determinants of general ICT access and usage, this paper examines three sets of determining factors behind mobile internet adoption: (1) physical infrastructure (coverage by a 3G or above mobile network, and electricity access); (2) socioeconomic factors such as gender, income level, location (urban/rural), education level, price of mobile data packages, price of internet-enabled phones, and so on; and (3) perspective factors shaped by the institutional environment, culture, and network effects.",
    "To further unpack the impact of income on affordability, the analysis tries an alternative specification with inclusion of a few affordability dummies while other covariates remain the same.",
    "10 Annex 2 contains detailed country-level information on smartphone ownership and smartphone uptake rates.",
    "At a later stage, other social science disciplines came into play as the research on the digital divide evolved.",
    "In 2017-18, ICT policy think tanks in the Global South, including RIA (Research ICT Africa), LIRNEasia (Learning Initiative for Network Economies in Asia), and DIRSI (el Di\u00e1logo Regional sobre la Sociedad de la Informaci\u00f3n / Regional Dialogue on the Information Society), coordinated a global initiative, conducting household surveys to collect information about ICT access and usage at household and individual levels.",
    "To understand how the prices of mobile data packages affect the adoption of mobile internet, the analysis considers a country's average cost per 1 gigabyte (GB) of mobile data, and constructs a dummy variable that equals 1 if the country's average cost per 1 GB of mobile data is more than 2 percent of the individual's monthly income.",
    "Finally, the overall explanatory power of the regression is slightly lower when income is used (0.45) than when the two affordability dummies are used (0.47).",
    "However, with regards to mobile internet, existing studies have a few limitations.",
    "As shown by Srinuan and Bohlin (2011) and Helbig, Gil-Garcia, and Ferro (2005) , the determinants can be grouped into three categories: (1) physical infrastructure on the supply side; (2) socioeconomic factors on the demand side, such as income and education level; and (3) perspective factors on the demand side shaped by the institutional environment, culture, language, and network effects.",
    "The sign and significance of the coefficient of different factors affecting mobile internet adoption are still retained after excluding those observations."
