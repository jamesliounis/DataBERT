    "However, more sequence data from Colombia and undersampled countries together with information of sampling representativeness per country is needed in order to account for sampling uncertainty in a more statistically rigorous manner.",
    "Processed reads were aligned against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank NC_045512.2) and consensus genomes were generated using BWA-MEM version 0.7.17 (24) and BBMap (27).",

    "The full genomic dataset was classified in lineages (29) using PANGOLIN (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages) (30) and aligned with 10 iterative refinements using MAFFT (31).",
    "Processed reads were aligned against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank NC_045512.2) using BWA-MEM (24).",
    "The unprecedented global health and societal emergency posed by the COVID-19 pandemic urged unprecedented data sharing and faster-than-ever outbreak research developments which are reflected in the fact that over 37.000 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes have been made available through public databases, mainly GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data).",
    "Library preparation and sequencing were performed following the ARTIC network (realtime molecular epidemiology for outbreak response) protocol and both Nanopore and Illumina technologies (21).",
    "This study was performed following the ethical standards noted in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.",

    "Therefore, the inferences about the number of introductions and the corresponding geographical source need to be interpreted with caution.",
    "Most of the notified introductions occurred from Europe and this observation was supported by phylogenetic and air travel data.",
    "The information used for this study comes from secondary sources of data that were anonymized and do not represent a risk to the community.",
    "We attempted to overcome this by undertaking sensitivity analyses and contrasting the results with the available epidemiological .",
    "C.J.V-A is supported by an ERC Starting Grant (award number 757688).",
    "The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained in the present study and those from Colombia deposited in GISAID were collated (n=122) and combined with 1461 representative genome sequences from the South America-focused subsampling available from NextStrain (28) as in 20-May-2020 (Suppl Table 1 ) plus reference MN908947.3.",
    "The number of international flights and number of passengers arriving to Colombia from January 1 to March 9, 2020 were obtained from the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics of Colombia (Aerocivil, aerocivil.gov.co).",
    "Secondly, we use air travel data from important destinations in Colombia but other locations may also have fueled COVID-19 emergence and dissemination in the country; flight travel data was not available from March 9, 2020, onwards.",
    "This study has some limitations.",
    "Our study provided evidence that an important number of independent introductions occurred to Colombia with at least 12 lineages documented.",
    "Funding This work was funded by Instituto Nacional de Salud.",

    "Although the sequence data do not represent the actual number of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains, our phylogenetic findings validated the linkage for those epidemiologicallylinked transmission chains with available sequence data.",
    "This observation is also in agreement with our estimates using travel data as detailed below ( Figure 3C and Figure S2 ).",
    "In case of a public health emergency or when scientific research in public health is required, the national law 9/1979, decrees 786/1990 and 2323/2006, authorizes the INS to use the biological material and associated epidemiological information without informed consent, including the anonymous disclosure of results.",

    "These findings contribute to the molecular surveillance of COVID-19 and provide venues for future outbreak response and interventions in the country.",
    "This approach which relies on phylogenetic analysis has allowed researchers across the world to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 emergence in humans, to track its geographical spread and to investigate its evolutionary dynamics (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .",
    "However, we estimate that 87% of all imported COVID-19 cases came from Europe, 9.5% from North America, and 3.4% from South America.",
    "The relative proportion of expected importations of COVID-19 by country to Colombia was inferred by taking into account SARS-CoV-2 incidence per international air passengers arriving in Colombia and the available flight travel.",
    "Most of the NVs (92 out of 133) were unique to a sequence and among the shared NVs, 38 (out of 41) were associated with a specific lineage (Tables S2 and S3 ).",
    "When stratified by country, the .",
    "Thirdly, the number of sequences sampled represented a tiny fraction of the documented number of imported cases into Colombia; the sample was selected to be a country-wide representative given limited resources for genome sequencing and consequently, the introduced viral diversity may also have been underestimated.",
    "The introductions post-peak occurred for the most part from South American countries.",
    "A root-to-tip regression of genetic distance against sampling time evidenced consistent temporal signal in the sequence data ( Figure 2B ).",
    "Nasopharyngeal swabs samples from patients with clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 across the country were received at the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS, National Institute of Health) as part of the virological surveillance of COVID-19.",
    "These samples were barcoded with the Native Barcoding Kit EXPNBD104 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and pooled in an equimolar amount.",
    "Single nucleotide variants were called with a coverage depth of at least 20x and then polished consensus was generated using Nanopolish version 0.13.2 (25).",
