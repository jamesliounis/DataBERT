    "We used the full set of ADNI2 baseline dataset (202 subjects, 1 failed with FreeSurfer 5.3.0), which consists of: 40 patients of AD, 37 patients of LMCI, 73 patients of EMCI and 51 subjects of CU.",
    "The empirical results, in a total of six comparisons, demonstrated that the spherical sparse coding method achieved greater statistical power than some other standard features.",
    "For the comparison purpose, the raw cortical thickness data from FreeSurfer, whole brain volume and area calculated by FreeSurfer were also used as features with SVM as the classifier on the same set of classification tasks.",
    "In this work, Stochastic Coordinate Coding (SCC) [11] was adopted to construct the dictionary because of its computation efficiency.",
    "The main contributions of this work are as follows.",
    "All subjects underwent thorough clinical and cognitive assessment at the time of acquisition, the statistics with gender, age and the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score shown in Table.",
    "[7] overcame the difficulties associated with both types of features by adopting the noise-filtered vertex-wise cortical thickness data based on spatial frequency analysis.",
    "We randomly split the data into training and testing sets using a In each set of experiment, we compared cortical thickness on left, right hemisphere and both hemispheres (whole brain), respectively.",
    "In our work, with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier [15] , our system achieved an average of 91.5% on six different classification tasks in our relatively large-sized ADNI2 baseline dataset (N = 201).",
    "In our experiments, the new approach is applied to Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 database [18] .",
    "In this paper, a spherical sparse coding and dictionary learning method is proposed and it achieves relatively high classification results on publicly available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 dataset (N = 201) which contains structural MRI data of four clinical groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), later MCI (LMCI) and AD.",
    "z i,t and D t denotes the value of z i and D in the t th epoch.",
    "Table 2 shows classification performance on six different experiments.",
    "Output: The learned dictionary and coefficients D, Z where\nfor i = 1 to n do Calculate the sparse code z i by using several steps of coordinate descent (CD) [11] .",
    "[6] constructed a classifier at each vertex by using the cortical thickness as a feature vector.",
    "These summary statistics are much lower in dimension than the original data.",
    "Usually, several epochs are required to obtain a satisfactory result.",
    "To prevent an arbitrary scaling of sparse codes, the columns d j are constrained by\nThus, the problem of dictionary learning can be rewritten as a matrix factorization problem as follows:\nwhere || \u00b7 || 2 F is the Frobenius norm.",
    "And among all six experiments, the new method with whole cortical thickness at least achieved three best measures among all comparisons.",
    "Our second contribution is to adopt novel feature reduction scheme, such as sparse coding and max-pooling [14] , which improves the efficiency and efficacy of the performance using high-dimensional cortical thickness on a variety of AD diagnosis tasks.",
    "Max-pooling is an aggregate statistics dimensional reduction technique.",
    "A number of research has been focused on accurate estimation of cortical thickness (as reviewed in [2] ).",
    "Directly using raw cortical thickness measures as features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for clinical group classification only yields modest results since brain areas are not equally atrophied during AD progression.",
    "Specifically, we use 7 epochs to learn the dictionary in this work.",
    "In this paper, we presented a spherical sparse coding framework, applied it to study cortical thickness feature reduction problem, and evaluated our method on the ADNI2 dataset to check its classification performance.",
    "Nevertheless, having a different systematic approach, which focuses on cortical thickness and validated for different group classifications, including early MCI (EMCI) and later MCI (LMCI), to aid in the diagnosis and understanding of AD progression would be highly advantageous to the preclinical AD research.",
    "After we applied SCC to learn the sparse features, maxpooling [14] and SVM [15] were applied for additional dimension reduction and classification.",
    "In our experimental results (Table 2), we can observe that the proposed method always achieved the best results in all six different classification tasks.",
    "Input: Initial dictionary D and image patches {x 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n }.",
    "With the initial dictionary D by selected patches, we summarize the SCC algorithm in Algorithm 1.",
    "[5] investigated the potential of fully automated measurements of cortical thickness to reproduce the clinical diagnosis in 19 AD and 17 cognitive unimpaired (CU) subjects.",
    "For AD vs. CU, AD vs. LMCI, AD vs. EMCI, LMCI vs. CU, EMCI vs. CU and LMCI vs. EMCI, the proposed method achieved the best AUC 0.963, 0.899, 0.923, 0.948, 0.866 and 0.791, respectively.",
    "In our approach, the spherical parameter surface is the canonical space from which patches are selected.",
    "After we compute these patches, sparse coding combined with max-pooling [14] are applied for cortical thickness feature dimension reduction.",
    "Update the dictionary D by performing on step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [11] .",
    "The results show regionally variant patterns of discrimination ability, with over 90% accuracy, but the subject amounts are relative small.",
    "Then sparse coding is applied to the resulting surface patch features, followed by max-pooling to extract the final feature sets.",
    "There has been a growing interest to apply computeraided diagnostic classification techniques to analyze cortical thickness features and diagnose different stages of AD and especially in preclinical individuals at high risk for AD to facilitate early interventions.",
    "We evaluated our proposed method on six classification experiments, including (1) AD vs. CU, (2) AD vs. LMCI, (3) AD vs. EMCI, (4) LMCI vs. CU, (5) EMCI vs. CU and (6) LMCI vs. EMCI.",
    "Finally, SVM classifier is used for classification of different AD clinical groups.",
    "The results show the superiority of the proposed method over other cortical morphometry systems and offer a different way to study the early identification and prevention of AD.",
    "Sparse coding and dictionary learning has been successful in many image processing tasks as it can concisely model natural image patches.",
    "It means the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive example is higher than a randomly chosen negative example and indicates that we may have learned a good classifier.",
    "In this way, the p-dimensional vector x i is represented by an m-dimensional vector z i , which means the",
    "Since cortical thickness estimation algorithm generates high dimensional features, some feature reduction algorithms are usually applied before classification.",
    "Although the vertex-wise data can reflect local deformity of a small region, they are sensitive to noise and registration errors.",
    "To further compare performance, we also plot ROC curves with computed AUC measures, which are shown in Figure 3 .",
    "Based on the cortical thickness features computed by FreeSurfer, this paper proposes a novel machine learning framework for the diagnosis of different stages of AD.",
    "First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first sparse coding work formulated on the sphere domain although sparse coding has achieved great success on standard Euclidean image domains [9] and recently in the hyperbolic domain [10] .",
    "Given a finite training set of signals, in this case thickness features, X = (x 1 , x 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x n ) in R p\u00d7n image patches."
