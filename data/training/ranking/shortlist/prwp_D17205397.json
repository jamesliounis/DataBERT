    "Later studies use the cross-country data from the latest rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).",
    "Using time series cross-country data on fertility and HIV prevalence rates, Young (2007) nds a similar eect.",
    "16 Attanasio (2009) and Delavande et al.",
    "This paper is a product of the Human Development and Public Services Team, Development Research Group.",
    "My analysis diers from these studies both in the empirical approach and in the type of data used in the analysis.",
    "The testing component of the survey was linked to an experiment that is described and analyzed by Thornton (2008) .",
    "My analysis is most closely related to studies that model fertility decision-making as a sequential process (Heckman and Willis (1974) ) and studies of fertility in environments with non-negligible infant and child mortality risk (Wolpin, 1984; Sah, 1991; Mira, 2007) .",
    "Fink and Linnemayr (2009) , linking historical data from World Fertility Surveys (WFS) with the DHS data, argue that while HIV does not have a signicant eect on aggregate fertility levels, it aects dierently women depending on their educational attainment.",
    "15 The dierent rounds of the longitudinal dataset contain extensive information on more than 4,000 men and women, at the individual, household and community levels.",
    "I supplement the use of the MDICP data with statistics about survival after infection and child mortality from other studies that use data from samples with repeated HIV testing and frequent follow-ups.",
    "The expectations data were collected using a novel bean-counting method, developed by Delavande and Kohler (2009) , which is appropriate for populations with low levels of numeracy.",
    "Results of the baseline environment simulation are presented in Panel A of Table15.",
    "The author may be contacted at gshapira@worldbank.org.",
    "To assess model t, I compare the model's prediction of the distributions of reported beliefs and pregnancy probabilities to the distributions of actual beliefs and pregnancies observed in the data.",
    "The data contain extensive information on more than 4,000 individuals at the individual and household level.",
    "Change Project (MDICP) dataset, a rich longitudinal dataset collected in rural areas of three dierent districts of the country.",
    "(1997) , Schultz (1997) , and Wolpin (1997) survey the literature on fertility.",
    "The main estimation sample contains data on 1006 women from the MDICP dataset.",
    "These results are presented in Panel B of Table 15 .",
    "I use a subsample of 1006 married women who were interviewed at least once during the 2006 and 2008 rounds, when family rosters and subjective expectations were collected.",
    "Tables 7 to 11 report the parameter estimates and their standard errors.",
    "Kalemli-Ozcan (2006) , using similar types of data, shows that regressing total fertility rate on HIV/AIDS prevalence can yield both positive and negative eects with dierent estimation strategies and dierent measures of HIV prevalence.",
    "where w ti is a vector of woman's initial conditions, including region of residence, schooling level, age of marriage, whether she is married to a polygamous husband, year of birth, and the number of children she had in the rst period observed interacted with the age she was when rst observed.",
    "(2010) review existing subjective expectations data from developing countries.",
    "The rates are reported in Table 6 .",
    "The reports are assumed to be made according to the 19 As in Delavande and Kohler (2009) following rule:",
    "Information about the hazard process is contained in the HIV test results, the age in which the tests were taken, and the ages in which a woman is last observed (regardless of testing histories).",
    "Table 13 compare the fertility and belief reporting outcomes predicted by the model to the actual outcomes observed in the data.",
    "The characteristics of the sample used in the counterfactuals is presented in Table 14 .",
    "Model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood with longitudinal data from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, which contain family rosters, information on HIV testing, and measures of subjective beliefs about own HIV status.",
    "The table includes the average beliefs and infection rates at dierent points of the women's life-cycle, number of life-cycle births as well as the average number of child mortality experienced by a woman.",
    "As seen in On average, women of that group assign probabilities of 0.59 and 0.69 to being infected when 21 There were signicant improvements in model t beyond three types.",
    "The three sampled regions vary signicantly in several aspects that are potentially relevant for the analysis, such as HIV prevalence rates, polygamy rates, and schooling levels.",
    "These data provide more precise information on times of infection and death than MDICP does.",
    "A unique feature of the MDICP dataset is that it includes measures of subjective likelihoods respondents assign to being HIV-positive.",
    "The perceived hazard rate for each period is a function of a woman's characteristics, such as her age, region of residence, marital status, and schooling level.",
    "Table 13 shows the actual and predicted annual pregnancy probabilities by region, schooling level, and polygamy status of the husband.",
    "Each period, a woman receives a utility ow from household consumption (C ), her number of children (N ), pregnancy status (p), and a time-varying preference shock ( p ) which is iid across time and women.",
    "Studies using the Malawi Diusion and Ideational Change Project data show that individuals in rural Malawi tend to overestimate both the probability of being HIV-infected (Anglewicz and Kohler, 2009) and the HIV prevalence in their community (Anglewicz, 2007) .",
    "The model successfully fits the fertility patterns in the data, as well as the distribution of reported beliefs about own HIV status.",
    "As can be seen in Table 7 , the marginal utilities of additional children are positive for the rst child and are decreasing with the stock of surviving children for all women.",
    "Income depends on region of residence (Balaka, Mchinji), size of household's land plot (Land High), the age of the woman (t), the number of children (N ), and a time-varying income 10 The majority of respondents in each of the three sites of the MDICP dataset are of dierent tribal groups.",

    "Since 2004, each round of data collection included HIV testing of respondents and the prevalence rate was found to be about seven percent.",

    "The contribution of woman i to the sample likelihood is given by",
    "Delavande and Kohler (2009) nd that the reported subjective expectations follow basic properties of probabilities and that the assessments of HIV-infection vary meaningfully with observable characteristics associated with dierent levels of HIV prevalence.",
    "The parameters of the utility function are estimated using the data on pregnancy outcomes.",
    "Because of these features of the data, I abstract from modeling the decision to get tested."
