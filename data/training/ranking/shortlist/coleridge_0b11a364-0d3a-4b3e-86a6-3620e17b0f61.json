    "And research by Dabney et al.",
    "The data set used in this study was created by merging records of individualized data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Pre-Medical College Admission Test Questionnaire (PMQ) and the Student Record System (SRS).",
    "A characteristic of this data set is that it is an aggregation of a series of data sets collected over a span of 6 years from [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] for the PMQ, with follow-up data for MD/PhD program enrollment updated through 2012.",
    "We used data from the PMQ for the years 2001-2006, which included respondent-reported participation in SLRA programs in high school and college.",
    "More recent quasi-experimental research by Knezek et al.",
    "Therefore, the results from model 5 fitted to the aggregate data set indicate that respondents with both HSSLRA and CLRA experiences have 4.50 times greater odds of matriculating into an MD/PhD program than respondents not reporting an LRA experience.",
    "Table 1 displays comparisons between respondents who entered MD/PhD programs (n = 3056) and respondents who did not (n = 233,376) regarding HSSLRA and CLRA participation, sex, race/ethnicity, parental occupation, and MCAT score.",
    "In this analysis, we examined data collected from and about a national cohort of students who had considered careers in medicine to address the following two questions:\n1.",
    "These results are summarized in Table 3 .",
    "By including CLRA, the analysis controls for laboratory research experience, allowing for a direct comparison of individuals reporting backgrounds with respect to HSSLRA and CLRA experiences from the four categories shown in Table 2 .",
    "To address the research questions, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis with STATA 11.0 statistical software package using the maximum-likelihood estimation approach to estimate the fitted probability of an individual to enroll in an MD/PhD program (1 = yes, 0 = no).",
    "This study's findings, as with all quantitative research, should be considered with respect to limitations.",
    "The reader should bear in mind that these results are consistent across PMQ cohorts spanning 6 years tracked longitudinally from 2001 to 2012 While these outcomes were found to be statistically significant, a greater type of significance is likely at play for young people.",
    "The predictor and control variables included in the analysis are listed in Table 1 .",
    "The second was data regarding background information on high schools and colleges attended (i.e., wealth and size) by our participants.",
    "For the purposes of this study, we concentrated on a particular subset of the emerging biomedical research workforce: medical school students enrolled in MD/PhD programs (i.e., MD/PhD program enrollees).",
    "This approach allows researchers to identify potential problems with the analysis and to clearly identify the apparent \"impact\" of each new variable as it is introduced into the analysis.",
    "All data were linked for individual PMQ respondents, with duplications removed and deidentified for analysis.",
    "Finally, to address the second research question, we took the aggregated data set and split it into four subsamples based on the four race/ethnicity demographic groupings.",
    "On the basis of Table 2 , we computed a new four-category variable for analysis based on reported participation: \"both HSSLRA and CLRA,\" \"only CLRA,\" \"only HSSLRA,\" and \"neither HSSLRA nor CLRA (no LRA).\"",
    "The difference in degrees of freedom using a \u03c7 2 (0.50) distribution was used to determine whether the inclusion of a covariate resulted in a statistically significant improvement (Pedhazur, 1997) .",
    "Once the final model was developed, we tested its stability by comparing model fitted across six subsamples disaggregated year by year.",
    "Table 4 displays the results of the series of nested logistic regression models with each model including an additional covariate, allowing us to examine how the inclusion of each successive covariate influenced the overall model fit and other parameter estimates.",
    "In their logistic regression analysis of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, which included 1988 survey data from students in eighth grade who indicated their future career preferences at age 30 and data for those who obtained baccalaureate degrees from 4-year institutions by the year 2000, Tai et al.",
    "While the study collected surveys from more than 30,000 participants, data were not collected by the AAMC survey regarding the actual activities in which students engaged.",
    "For example, one study (Dabney et al., 2012) found that participation in OST science clubs and competitions had a strong positive association with college STEM career interest.",
    "Individual parameter estimates were also evaluated by testing whether the individual z-statistics were statistically significant.",
    "Thus, we disaggregated the data and tested model 5 using each of the six data sets.",
    "The SRS data were used to determine whether the respondent enrolled in an MD/PhD program at the time of medical school matriculation, for the years 2001-2011, allowing a minimum of 5 years for the most recent PMQ respondents in 2006 to choose the MD/PhD career path at matriculation, as MCAT examinees who ultimately matriculate in medical school may not do so for quite a few years after the initial MCAT attempt.",
    "Second, this approach allowed us to see how the inclusion of each successive covariate influenced the overall model and the other parameter estimates.",
    "Finally, regarding the second research question, the results indicate that among Black/African-American (non-Hispanic) respondents, those in the both HSSLRA and CLRA group had 3.6 greater odds of matriculating into an MD/PhD program than no LRA respondents, while those in the only CLRA group had 2.82 greater odds.",
    "While more rigorous research has examined the impact of student participation in research at the postsecondary level (Lopatto, 2004; Russell et al., 2007; Hernandez et al., 2012) , the body of literature examining outcomes pertaining to high school research participation remains somewhat limited.",
    "The area between the estimated probability curve for both HSSLRA and CLRA (blue line) and only CLRA (green line) offers some indication of the \"added value\" of the HSSLRA experience for respondents who continue to pursue LRA experiences in college.",
    "The authors note that some control variables were not included in our data set.",
    "Next, we used model 5 to examine our findings for the 2001-2006 data set stratified by the four racial/ethnic demographic groups.",
    "Figure 1 also shows that levels of academic achievement/preparedness, as measured by MCAT scores, vary substantially among MD-PhD program enrollees and, importantly, the benefit of LRAs is evident across a wide range of MCAT scores.",
    "Abraham's (2002) qualitative study of 75 high school students who participated in a research apprenticeship at a remote field station contextualized and corroborated these findings; participants reported developing more positive views of scientists and the scientific community and a subsequent increase in their interest in and involvement with the sciences.",
    "This stratified analysis allowed us to determine whether our findings for the predictive value of each of the three LRA categories (compared with neither HSSLRA nor CLRA participation) observed in the analysis of model 5 shown in Table 4 were consistent across each of the four racial/ ethnic groups (Table 3) .",
    "This is explained in part by prior research that has found that secondary students' confidence for doing science increases after participation in OST research programs (Templin et al., 1999; Rohrbaugh and Corces, 2011) and science-focused activities (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011) .",
    "The results from the disaggregated racial/ethnicity analysis presents a very similar picture across all four demographic groups, although the impact to African-American students appeared to be somewhat less than for Latino/a students (further research examining this differential impact of HSSLRAs for Latino/a(s) and African-American students appears to be warranted).",
    "Table 5 shows the odds ratios produced from model 5 of the aggregated data set (column 1) in comparison with the model 5 odds ratios for the six year-by-year disaggregated data sets (columns 2-7).",
    "There were 344 respondents with missing data for sex status; and 11,199 respondents who did not have a valid MCAT score were also excluded.",
    "(2016) further indicated that families with higher parental education have a greater likelihood of participating in OST science, which then associated with an earlier initial interest in science.",
    "Research has found that such programs can bolster student science self-identity and self-efficacy (Hunter et al., 2006; Bakken et al., 2010; Herrera and Hurtado, 2011) and provide much-needed mentorship, support, and motivation (Chubin et al., 2009; Rohrbaugh and Corces, 2011) .",
    "Further studies examining science interest have provided evidence for the effectiveness of out-of-school time (OST) activities (Bauer and Bennett, 2003; Sackes et al., 2009) and the influence of teachers, parents, and peers on students' science attitudes (Rodrigues et al., 2009; Sevinc et al., 2011) .",
    "Prior research has corroborated the importance of such programs for increasing secondary students' interest in science careers by providing them with close mentorship and hands-on experience with authentic scientific endeavors (Stake and Mares, 2001; Winkleby et al., 2009; Sadler et al., 2010) .",
    "To verify model fit, we evaluated each model's goodness of fit using the likelihood ratio test to determine whether an additional covariate (or set of covariates) improved the fit of the model from each successive nested model (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1980; Menard, 2001) .",
    "Through this study, we found that respondents reporting both HSSLRA and CLRA participation were more than four times more likely to matriculate into an MD/PhD programs than their peers who did not report LRA experiences.",
    "We fitted a series of nested logistic regression models.",
    "We continue with an examination of the cross-tabulation of HSSLRA and CLRA experiences (see Table 2 )."
