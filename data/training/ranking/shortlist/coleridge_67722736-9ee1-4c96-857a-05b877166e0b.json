  "shortlist": [
    "We reviewed published data from available resources, including the published literature, International Agency on Cancer Research (IARC), hospital-based cancer registries, and Ministry of Health (MOH) data.",
    "The aforementioned data sources were reviewed for incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases for the time periods of available data specific to each nation.",
    "Data from the USA was obtained from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance and Epidemiology End Results Program (SEER) 18 dataset for the period 1985-2009.",
    "Data from Honduras was obtained from a prospective, population-based study, which utilized a combined endoscopy and pathology registry to assess gastric cancer incidence in the rural western region of the country [5] .",
    "Finally, data from El Salvador was obtained from a targeted review of databases from the three largest public hospitals (Hospital Rosales, Hospital Zacamil, and Hospital General ISSS).",
    "All data had been deidentified by the participating institutions prior to receipt by the authors (JEC, JDH) for analysis.",
    "Data from this study was considered high quality, given its geographic representativeness, complete information on histology and anatomical subsite, versus the limited data from the three IARC-affiliated hospital-based registries [5] .",
    "Data was summarized using Excel (Microsoft Office 2007) and Stata (Stata SE11.2).",
    "Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of gastric cancer in Central America based upon the available data and with comparison to Hispanics living in the USA.",
    "Data from Costa Rica and Panama were obtained from their National Cancer Registries (Registro Nacional de Tumores de Costa Rica and the Registro Nacional de C\u00e1ncer de Panama, respectively), both of which are certified by IARC and have national coverage.",
    "Data from Guatemala were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (IN-CAN), which is a national referral center for cancer treatment with records of all new patient consultations in their hospitals and clinics.",
    "In Central America, a total of 19,741 incident gastric adenocarcinomas were identified from the available data sources of variable intervals during the 1985-2011 period (Table 1) .",
    "Studies with data from US hospitals and SEER reviews show that in general, Hispanics have more distal type cancer than non-Hispanic whites [14, 15, 18] .",
    "The information on anatomic location and histology was somewhat limited in the Central America databases (53 and 67 % unspecified) and SEER database (19 and 58 % unspecified).",
    "Raw frequencies and percentage of cases for available data from each nation are reported.",
    "so data sets were collected to fit in the same age groups.",
    "Registry standardization (e.g., IARC CANREG5) may also help improve missing and incomplete data on anatomical subsite and histology, which is common, even in the high-quality Costa Rica and US SEER databases.",
    "For the most part, the available data encompassed 10-15-year periods between 1996 and 2011, with the exception of the national Costa Rica registry .",
    "Diffuse type was more common in the US Hispanics sample (Table 3) .",
    "Lastly, regarding the US SEER data, studies have shown that identification algorithms can misidentify Hispanic groups, especially US born Hispanics [29] .",
    "In Costa Rica data, the National Cancer Registry records cases as urban, rural, or semiurban according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) criteria.",
    "This distribution among US Hispanics is similar to the US overall distribution reported since 1977 (37.7 %, n= 9707/25,752) [19] .",
    "The demographic variables (age, gender, ethnic group, year of diagnosis, residency setting rural/urban) and two pathological variables (anatomical subsite and histological type) were recorded.",
    "Overall incidence rates were not calculated due to lack of population-at-risk data for most countries.",
    "As noted, different diagnostic criteria and recording methodologies were used in each country.",
    "Our study has a number of methodologic limitations.",
    "A significant burden of gastric adenocarcinoma is observed in Central America based upon the available registry data and in spite of the probable underreporting for the LMICs in the areas.",
    "Two centers in our sample (Nicaragua and Panama) had already recorded age in groups subsets (15-44, 45-54, etc.)",
    "Because data sources are heterogeneous and methodology for cases registration is non-uniform, no statistical tests were used to compare differences between countries.",
    "Our study highlights the burden of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and also underscores the critical need for cancer registry capacity building A number of hurdles exist to advance PBCRs in low resource settings.",
    "Despite the lack of population-based data, our results are consistent with the observation of a decrease in the intestinal-type gastric cancer incidence after migration, which is potentially related to the decline in H. pylori infection rates and other environmental and dietary exposures.",
    "Cancers of the antrum were more common in Central America (73.6 %, n=4495/6105), whereas cancers of the corpus were slightly more common among US Hispanics (53.9 %, n= 2383/4413).",
    "For example, longitudinal endoscopy registries can provide reliable information on gastric cancer incidence and temporary trends and identify risk factors to design and implement targeted prevention efforts [5] .",
    "IARC country cancer incidence rates (GLOBOCAN 2008) are presented for comparison purposes [6] .",
    "The intestinal subtype was relatively more common in Central America (64.3 %) but less so in US Hispanics (30.5 %), with the caveat that about 50 % of the data from the registries did not report the Lauren classification.",
    "These two key determinants may be \"imported\" at the time of immigration from high-incidence areas, such as Central America, and therefore may be instructive for cancer control among US Hispanics.",
    "In the US SEER database 1985-2009, 7871 incident gastric cancer cases were identified among Hispanics (Table 2) .",
    "Purpose The aims of this study were to delineate the epidemiology of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and contrast it with Hispanic-Latino populations in the USA.",
    "In Nigeria, information provided by a network of 11 hospital-based cancer registries proved effective to determine the most frequent cancer types and subtypes presenting to the health care system, prioritize resource allocation, and improve cancer care delivery [27] .",
    "Specifically, the intestinal type accounted for 64.3 % of gastric cancers in Central America (n=4200/6530) but only 30.5 % among US Hispanics (n=1001/3285) [19] .",
    "As expected, nearly three fourths (14,539) of cases in our analysis were from Costa Rica, attributed to their long-standing national cancer registry.",
    "As seen in similar studies, there was a high prevalence of non-cardia and intestinal type of cancer in Central America.",
    "All Hispanic patients defined by the Hispanic/Latino Identification Algorithm (HLIA) were included [17] .",
    "Epidemiologic studies comparing the gastric cancer incidence in Asians and Asian immigrants to the USA support this transition [25, 26] .",
    "For the subsite analysis, pylorus C16.4 and fundus C16.1 locations were grouped as fundus, and corpus C16.2, lesser curvature C16.5, and greater curvature C16.6 were grouped as corpus.",
    "These findings are consistent with global observations: as countries progress through the epidemiologic transition, there is a drop in gastric carcinoma incidence primarily due to the decrease in the intestinal-type gastric cancer, which is in turn likely related to the decline in H. pylori infection rates and other environmental factors [23, 24] .",
    "For reported data, non-cardia gastric cancer was far more common in Central America (83.3 %, n=6904/8285), among US Hispanics (80.2 %, n=4413/5501) and among Hispanics born in Central America (86.3 %, n=746/864).",
    "Of note, in Honduras, the country with highest-quality gastric cancer registry, the diffuse type was more common (Table 1) .",
    "Studies have proposed alternative approaches to improve national cancer data for LMICs.",
    "In comparison to US Hispanics, the patients were significantly younger [19] ."
