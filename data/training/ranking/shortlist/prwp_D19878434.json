  "shortlist": [
    "Galu\u0161\u010d\u00e1k et al (2012) , using the same data sets that this paper uses, provide an extensive analysis of the factors that determine the wages of newly-hired employees as opposed to incumbents.",
    "This is in line with results relying on the frequency of wage cuts in industry data across countries reported by Holden and Wulfsberg (2009) .",
    "Messina and R\u00f5\u00f5m (2012) use data from a survey that covers the recent downturn for a sub-sample of the firms surveyed here and show that wage cuts remained rare.",
    "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
    "( , 2012b and Messina et al.",
    "7 In order to make the results representative of the total population, the cross-country statistics presented in the following sections use employment adjusted weights.",
    "An advantage that this study has over earlier work in this area is the use of cross-country data gathered as part of a harmonised survey designed specifically to examine wage setting practices across firms.",
    "In contrast to our summary statistics above, we now exploit the full information in the data in a multivariate analysis.",
    "On average, the response rates are comparable to those of similar surveys likeCampbell and Kamlani, (1997);Agell and Lundborg, (2003); orFranz and Pfeiffer, (2006).8 The employment adjusted weights account for the unequal probabilities of firms receiving and responding to the questionnaire across strata and also for the average firm size (measured as the number of employees) in the population in each stratum.",
    "The information is summarised in Table 1.",
    "As discussed in detail in Du Caju et al.",
    "17 To examine which of these explanations has the most support from the data, we ran a regression of the extent of wage cuts on the level of competition, with controls for country, sector, employee characteristics and firm size.",
    "(2012) , using data from the same survey of European firms that this paper will analyse, found that only 2% of firms would use base wage cuts as the main channel of labour cost reduction if faced with a significant cost shock.",
    "The analysis in the current paper is based on a survey of firms that was conducted between the second half of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 in 16 European Union countries, 14 of which included the questions analysed here on the reasons for avoiding wage cuts.",
    "9 A detailed description of the distribution of the sample by country, sector and size along with a description of the construction of employment based weights can be found in the online appendix to Babeck\u00fd et al (2012) .",
    "Table 3 presents the percentages of firms in each country that ranked a given reason as very relevant or relevant, and Table 4 shows the overall ranking of the different reasons.",
    "Our results are based on data collected prior to the economic downturn experienced by European countries in recent years.",
    "16 Panel A of Table 7 shows that there is a significant positive association between the intensity of perceived competition and the relevance of all theories.",
    "We would like to thank a referee for highlighting the different possible interpretations of these results.",
    "5 The survey was carried out by the national central bank of each country and all countries based the survey on a harmonised questionnaire, which was developed in the context of the Eurosystem Wage Dynamics Network, a research network analysing wage and labour cost dynamics.",
    "Our results lend partial support to this hypothesis.",
    "Although the data collection predates the onset of the European crisis, the survey provides unique and valuable information on the extent and rationale for wage rigidity, and enables us to evaluate the importance of different explanations for avoiding wage cuts.",
    "The second, and probably most detailed, set of explanations for downward wage rigidity can be found in the efficiency wage literature, which therefore motivates a number of the survey questions.",
    "Looking first at the effects of worker skill composition, the regression results presented in Table 6 indicate that firms employing a higher proportion of blue-collar and low-skilled white-collar workers rank labour regulation highly.",
    "Section 3 describes the data and presents summary statistics on the frequency of wage cuts and the ranking of the different explanations.",
    "To do this, we use a large specially commissioned survey of firms across fourteen European countries asking managers directly about their experiences with wage cuts.",
    "The list of possible reasons for avoiding wage cuts that firms were asked to assess in the survey was drawn from the extensive literature on wage setting and flexibility.",
    "In particular, the categorisation used by Campbell and Kamlani (1997) was used as the main basis for the selection of questions put to the firms.",
    "Dunlop (1944) , Shishter (1943) , and Oswald (1986) ).",
    "Indeed, our data show that there is a negative correlation between wage cuts across countries and the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements (see also Figure 1 below).",
    "The questions posed to the firms in our survey were based to a large extent on the classification of the potential reasons by Campbell and Kamlani (1997) .",
    "In a similar vein, Campbell and Kamlani (1997) also report that turnover-related explanations are important for white-collar workers.",
    "However, research using data covering periods of recessions also shows that wages are very rarely cut (Agell and Lundborg, 2003) .",
    "As we shall see later, this hypothesis is supported by the within country analysis, which finds stronger support for those two theories among firms with a higher share of temporary workers and among those that display a larger worker turnover rate.",
    "(2010) have exploited differences in workforce composition to assess the consistency of the observed patterns with labour market theories of downward wage rigidity indirectly, using administrative data.",
    "1 Labor turnover is defined as the sum of the workers joining and leaving the firm during the reference year as a percentage of total employment Robust p values in parentheses, *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.",
    "In addition, the survey obtained data on the proportion of workers in the firm covered by any kind of collective wage agreement, internal or external.",
    "We return to this issue and the potential explanations for the relationship between size and each of these theories, in the context of the regression analyses of Section 4.",
    "The harmonised questionnaire contained a core set of questions on the firms' wage setting strategies, which were asked in all countries and thus gives us a detailed and comparable picture of these issues across all countries.",
    "Franz and Pfeiffer, 2006; Kaufman, 1984; Campbell and Kamlani, 1997; Bewley, 1998) .",
    "The results corroborate the findings using bargaining coverage.",
    "Each panel includes a different set of regressions.",
    "We add this measure of competition as an additional control variable to the set of variables included in the regression specification that was presented in Table 6 .",
    "The interpretation of the patterns in Table 7 would therefore appear to be that firms in less competitive environments are under less pressure to cut wages, and therefore attach less weight to the potential barriers or concerns that such a course might encounter.",
    "The adverse selection model (Weiss 1980 (Weiss , 1990 would suggest that firms employing a higher share of high-skilled workers should be more concerned about their employees leaving.",
    "18 The results for the effect of employee turnover on the reported answers are presented in Panel C of Table 7 .",
    "This control variable was not included in the first set of regressions because its inclusion reduces the number of observations substantially.",
    "This is consistent with evidence for the US discussed in Bewley (2004) .",
    "14 Firm size is associated with a higher probability of a firm reporting many of the reasons as relevant or very relevant (Table 5 ).",
    "Our findings are qualitatively consistent with those of Du Caju et al."
