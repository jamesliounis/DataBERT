  "shortlist": [
    "This paper will describe the tool and some of the models the tool uses.",
    "The input data for the test case can be found in Table 1 .",
    "The paper will also describe the results of a test case compared to the EADS Astrium tool EUCES.",
    "Simplified models are extracted from these experiments and from numerical analysis with 3D flow solvers such as the commercially available code FLOW 3D [2] .",
    "The stratification and slosh model will be developed by investigating the results of 3D numerical analysis using FLOW 3D, as well as investigating the results from experiments executed at ZARM.",
    "Values for this accommodation coefficient are hard to obtain and values indicated in literature tend to vary over a large range.",
    "Some models have been adapted or added and some will be implemented in the future.",
    "In such cases, the accommodation coefficient can be a 'tuning' parameter to adapt the numerical results to that of measured results, rather than a real 'physical' parameter.",
    "The tool is not intended for detailed simulation of every phenomenon, but rather it should be able to give an estimation of integral values.",
    "Results of this simplified model will be compared with results using FLOW 3D.",
    "The simulation begins at about t=220 s, after first stage seperation.",
    "The input data of PMP consists of two parts; a mission specific part and a propellant system specific part.",
    "The problem when using this model is the determination of the accommodation coefficient.",
    "The increase in heated volume can be determined using: The average temperature in the heated upper stratum can be calculated using the following relation: By assuming a linear temperature profile in the upper stratum the temperature at the liquid surface can be calculated from T b (bulk temperature) and T av (the average temperature in the upper stratum).",
    "For example a more detailed model for evaporation of the liquid and stratification of liquid and gas is to be implemented.",
    "PMP including the new phase change model was compared to the EADS Astrium tool EUCES.",
    "Within the German national program \"cooperation project upper stage\", the SART (Space Launcher Systems Analysis) department at DLR in Bremen is developing a tool for this purpose.",
    "For example the cylindrical sections in the middle of the tanks are a bit higher in the PMP representation.",
    "Another important part of the future work will be the implementation of a sloshing model.",
    "The propellant system specific input consists of for example wall thickness, materials, propellant mass, initial propellant temperature and tank geometry.",
    "A part of the future work will therefore be the adaptation of the model such that it can also be used for upper stage tanks.",
    "Implementing these into the program should be fairly straightforward.",
    "EUCES has been extensively tested.",
    "Using this simplified model, some basic things such as evaporated propellant mass, pressurisation gas mass, ullage temperature and heat transfer between liquid and ullage could be compared.",
    "It is foreseen to implement these in PMP.",
    "It is therefore interesting to compare PMP with EUCES.",
    "At the Space Launcher System Analysis (SART) department of DLR, an engineering tool for the simulation of propellant management systems is under development.",
    "The dynamics of sloshing and its mechanical loads are well understood and analytical relations exist.",
    "The mission specific input can be defined as a function of time.",
    "For the future some extensions and improvements are foreseen.",
    "Currently, experiments are carried out by the Centre of Applied Spaceflight and Microgravity (ZARM) in Bremen to investigate the latter.",
    "After providing the input PMP is able to calculate the following data:\n\u2022 pressure (including hydrostatic pressure)\n\u2022 pipeline pressure drops \u2022 required pressurization mass \u2022 masses of all components \u2022 temperatures of the ullage and liquid \u2022 propellant loss (evaporation, venting)\n\u2022 Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP)\nDuring the simulation, pressure in the tanks will start to vary because of tank drainage and propellant boil off.",
    "Therefore one would expect the ullage temperature to be higher.",
    "Like PMP, EUCES is a propellant management tool which calculated propellant conditions in tanks and pipelines [3] [4].",
    "Visualization of the propellant management system is also possible (Figure 1 ).",
    "To obtain an efficient design, it is necessary to be able to simulate propellant behaviour and propellant management systems using fast engineering methods (CPU time in order of seconds, maximum a few minutes).",
    "Temperature of the liquid was assumed to remain unchanged: Apart from the fact that liquid temperature was assumed constant, the model has some additional shortcomings and therefore was adapted.",
    "A schematic representation of the model is given in Figure 7 .",
    "An example of an upper stage propellant management simulation will be presented and compared to EUCES, a tool used at Astrium based on EcosimPro.",
    "This coefficient is a measure for that chance of a molecule to undergo a phase change.",
    "The average temperature of the heated volume will be somewhere between T b and T s , depending on the temperature profile in the heated volume.",
    "Whereas PMP is meant to quickly determine the integral values of the propellant management system, EUCES simulates the processes on a more detailed level.",
    "The PMP simulation results in a somewhat lower ullage temperature, which seems a bit strange because according to Figure 3 the heat transferred from the ullage into the liquid is less in case of PMP.",
    "The accommodation coefficient can obtain values between 0 (no phase change) and 1 (maximum evaporation rate).",
    "Using tank pressure, hydrostatic pressure, pipeline radius, material properties and pipeline geometry (length and bends) velocity and pressure at each location in the pipeline can be calculated.",
    "In its current form the tool PMP calculates amongst others the required pressurization gas mass, pressure losses throughout the propellant feed system, pressure at all locations, and it includes a simple method for the determination of evaporated propellant mass and self-pressurization.",
    "However, the goals of each tool are somewhat different.",
    "This can be a good approximation when the tank is largely cylindrical and the dome surfaces are small compared to the cylindrical surface.",
    "The propellant management system can be optimized such that propellant residuals and loaded propellant are minimized.",
    "A major improvement in PMP has been made on the fluid temperature and phase change models."
