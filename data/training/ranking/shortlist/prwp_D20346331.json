    "The paper is structured as follows.",
    "See the discussion on this below.",
    "To analyze effects of inheritance reform, we use data from a 2011 follow up to the 2007 Rural Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS) conducted by India's National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa.",
    "2 and 4) in table 6 point towards significant and quantitatively large effects on primary completion.",
    "Descriptive statistics on characteristics of interest for generation II and III individuals by reform status are in table 1 (see appendix table 1 for values of the same variables by state).",
    "Results for time allocation in generation III are reported in table 2 with panels A and B referring to individuals in the 6 to 14 and 15 to 18 age groups, 9 and results from base and augmented specification in columns 1, 3, 5 and 7 and 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively.",
    "Further support for this is provided by studies showing that (i) greater female bargaining power helped reduce fertility and child mortality in India (Dyson and Moore 1983) ; (ii) receipt of pensions by females but not males affected girls' anthropometric status in South Africa (Duflo 2003 );",
    "This is complemented with household-level data on the amount of resources were spent for each child on education (books/stationery, transport/hostel and private coaching/tuition) and to cure preventable diseases as well as presence of a latrine, a variable we use as a proxy for attention to preventive rather than curative health.",
    "In households where the mother had benefited from the HSAA, females spent some 34% more on study (col. 7) and 12% less on household chores (col. 4) than male siblings if other factors are controlled for.",
    "Beyond the information routinely collected in multi-purpose household surveys (e.g., year of birth and years of schooling), our survey includes data on time use during a typical day for all individuals in generations II and III.",
    "Studies often use states' adoption of such provision at different points in time to achieve identification (Allen 1992; Friedberg 1998; Peters 1986; Wolfers 2006) .",
    "While assessing the extent to which the results found here carry over to other settings, including in North Indian states would be of interest.",
    "2002) and raise similar analytical issues.",
    "As survey data do not include the year of marriage by generation II, age is used as a proxy with two cut-offs corresponding to a marriage age of 30 (in col. 1 and 2) or 20 (in col. 3 and 4), respectively.",
    "This paper builds on this literature by assessing not only direct but also second-generation effects from the reform.",
    "To examine school completion, information from 2,172 generation III individual 15 to 34 years old in 823 generation II households is used (sample two).",
    "To test for HSAA-induced impacts on time allocation and education expenses, we use data from 1,226 generation III individuals from 6 to 18 years old in 557 generation II households (sample one).",
    "While the impact of the HSAA has to be estimated based on time variation with controls and fixed effects as needed, comparing between reform and non-reform states provides some illustration of the data.",
    "Results for completion of primary and secondary education in table 4 point towards considerable bias against females compared to males in the same household for primary (-0.36) or secondary (-0.17) completion.",
    "As explained in the text, the sample comprises generation III individuals 15-30 and 19-34 years old in 2011 (<14 years or < 18 in 1994) for primary and secondary education, respectively.",
    "The highly significant and negative coefficient on 'female' in cols.",
    "Figure 1 plots the density distribution of birth years for the sample, pointing towards an average age of 79, 49, and 19 years for individuals in generations I, II, and III, when data were collected.",
    "The samples to explore how the HSAA might have affected generation III girls' outcomes either directly or by empowering their (generation II) mothers, differ slightly from each other due to different age cut-offs.",
    "where, in line with earlier notation, denotes the value of assets including land brought into the marriage, is a dummy of whether the individuals' fathers died before 1994 so s/he would not have benefited from the reform even in the reform state, is an indicator variable for the 'young' cohort (generation II individuals below age 48/38 in 2011 who were less than 30/20 years in 1994 so that their marriage decisions were affected by the reform), 14 is a vector of state specific year of birth fixed effects to control for time-varying shocks or aggregate effects by state and other variables are defined as in equation 1.",
    "percentage points, consistent with female empowerment reducing fertility as found in the literature (Duflo 2012 ).",
    "1 and 3) and males (cols.",
    "2010) , in most contexts they will also affect gendered patterns of wealth.",
    "Results suggest far-reaching impacts on spouses' bargaining power in existing marriages and outcome variables such as domestic violence (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006) and female labor force participation (Stevenson and Wolfers 2007) .",
    "To do so, we use data for three generations of individuals in three Indian states, one of which implemented inheritance reforms in 1994.",
    "Although lack of information on generation II siblings makes use of household fixed effects impossible, resulting in estimates that are less robust than those discussed above, evidence of significant first-generation effects associated with the HSAA supports the hypothesis of 'first-generation' effects on generation II underpinning the second-generation HSAA effects discussed earlier.",
    "At a descriptive level doing so points towards significantly lower levels of fertility (2.78 vs. 3.46) but insignificant differences in survival rates or sex ratios and we will check this in a regression framework.",
    "Although we lack detailed health outcomes in our data, insufficient preventive care is likely to lead to greater incidence of otherwise preventable diseases, including the need to spend resources on dealing with these.",
    "To assess whether second-generation effects are plausible and to trace channels through which they might materialize, we complement evidence on second-generation effects with exploration of HSAA-induced impacts on the parent generation.",
    "A number of studies indeed explored first-generation effects of the HSAA.",
    "The value and nature of assets which a female brought to a marriage is an important determinant of women's bargaining power in Ethiopia (Kumar and Quisumbing 2012) and Tanzania (Peterman 2011) .",
    "and are indicator variables, respectively, for generation III females (compared to their male siblings), and whether their mothers' fathers died before or after 1994 so that mothers in the reform state either did not or did benefit from the reform, and 3 and 4 , the coefficients on their interactions with a reform dummy are key parameters of interest that capture first-and second-generation impacts of HSAA induced empowerment of generation II females, respectively, 8 and is a vector of gender and state specific year of birth fixed effects to control for time-variant aggregate effects or shocks by gender and state, As 3 and 4 may pick up the effect of resource transfers triggered by the HSAA, we also report results from specifications where, in addition to the above variables, assets brought into the marriage and the difference in education between the spouse and her husband are controlled for.",
    "Results for total educational spending as well as spending on books and stationary, the main category of such expenses, in table 3 point towards strongly positive second generation effects from reform.",
    "Figures in brackets are robust standard errors clustered by state.",
    "One study finds that, in early adopting states, women's likelihood of inheriting land increased and indicators of female empowerment such as girls' educational attainment and age at marriage improved (Deininger et al.",
    "Results for different types of educational spending (total, books and stationary, and only by the mother) in table 3 point towards strongly positive second-generation effects from reform throughout and, for the case of total and mother's spending, also in the first generation.",
    "Finally, to estimate the incidence of HSAA-induced health effects, measured as the need of treating diseases that could have been prevented with proper care, we use 1,399 generation III individuals 0 to 18 years old in 625 generation II households (sample three).",
    "where represents the outcome variable of interest as discussed above 7 , is a household-level fixed effect that controls for any time-invariant characteristics of generation II households.",
    "For those in generation II, we have information on the value of all assets (including land) brought into the marriage, access to an individual bank account, spending on education for each co-resident child, and the survival status or year of death of each parent.",
    "Robust standard errors in brackets are clustered by state.",
    "This was subsequently adopted on a national scale in 2005.",
    "Robust standard errors clustered by state in brackets.",
    "In fact, the potentially far-reaching effect of legal provisions regarding divorce (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006) or access to political office (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004) on female empowerment in the long term is well documented in the literature.",
    "Use of repeated cross sections suggests that the reforms may have given rise to compensatory behavior in the sense that they increased educational attainment but reduced the likelihood of girls inheriting land (Roy 2013) .",
