    "19 The viral metagenomic study speculated the deaths of these pangolins might be associated with coronaviruses.",
    "Alternatively, Wang et al.",
    "There are more than 30 registered randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib for COVID-19 treatment (e.g., N C T 0 4 4 2 1 0 2 7 , N C T 0 4 3 9 0 4 6 4 , N C T 0 4 3 3 4 0 4 4 , NCT04362137).",
    "124 A clinical study (NCT04328272) suggested that COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ showed improvement in clinical 128 However, the death rate of the administration with HCQ (25.7%) was barely higher than that of standard treatment (23.5%).",
    "It is currently being assessed in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment (NCT04395456).",
    "78 This AI model demonstrated better sensitivity than senior radiologists in an analysis of 279 patients.",
    "18 Noteworthily, the comparative analysis of genomic sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV revealed that there were three homologous genomic regions in their ORF1ab genes that could promote recombination.",
    "61 The results of thermal inactivation or lysis of NP swab samples with an increasing number of amplification cycles were also consistent with the standard detection methods.",
    "then published the genome information on the novel coronavirus immediately on virological.org and the GenBank database.",
    "12 Figure 1 depicts a series of important events and scientific discoveries since the advent of SARS-CoV-2.",
    "Detection, sampling, and processing methods of samples are directly affecting the accuracy of diagnostic results.",
    "developed a cheap, highthroughput SARS-CoV-2 detection method based on RT-PCR to analyze 10 000 samples in 1 operation at a price of $1 per sample.",
    "More efforts need to be made in acquiring detection methods that save time with better portability while maintaining good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision.",
    "At present, there are more than 100 institutions conducting related clinical trials on attenuated vaccines.",
    "15 In a genome-wide association study, SARS-CoV-2 was found to have a similarity of 79.5% in genomic sequence to the SARS coronavirus and to be 96% homologous to that of a bat-derived coronavirus, suggesting that bats are the main source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
    "There are a lot of clinical trials being conducted worldwide in assessing drugs and/or treatments for COVID-19.",
    "19 Although the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unspecified, great attention is required to monitor pangolin-associated activities in reducing the risk for COVID-19.",
    "A clinical study demonstrated that the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor showed comparable efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with that of a pre-existing condition of inflammatory bowel disease patients.",
    "76 In addition, a scalable multipathogen detection platform based on CRISPR-Cas detection developed by Ackerman et al.",
    "77 In brief, CRISPR-Cas-based detection methods are still in their introductory phase and need to be further optimized.",
    "122 It effectively inhibited the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human lung epithelial cell-derived Calu-3 cells, and its EC50 value was about 10 nM, 123 showing good potential for COVID-19 treatment.",
    "112 It is currently assessed in more than 26 clinical trials ranging from phase II to IV, showing positive effects in shortening the treatment time and improving the lung condition of COVID-19 patients.",

    "In Table 4 , selected inhibitors for clinical evaluation of COVID-19 are listed.",
    "There are more than 15 clinical trials ongoing assessing the safety and efficacy of nitric oxide, and it seems that nitric oxide is effective in improving blood oxygen saturation.",
    "32 It was observed that COVID-19 patients have high levels of IL-1b, chemokine (C\u2212X\u2212C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which may activate the T helper cell 1 (Th1) cellular response.",
    "The AI system performed better for diagnosing infected patients who tested positive for RT-PCR but showed normal CT scans.",
    "72 The detection limits of this sensor for SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium and clinical samples were 1.6 \u00d7 10 1 pfu/mL and 2.42 \u00d7 10 2 copies/mL, respectively.",
    "CDX-CoV, developed by Codagenix and the Serum Institute of India, represents one of the potential candidates of attenuated vaccines for COVID-19.",
