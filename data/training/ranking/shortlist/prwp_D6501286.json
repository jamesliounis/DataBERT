    "This section describes the methodology employed to test the hypotheses discussed in section 3 and reports our major findings.",
    "19 Table 7 reports the estimated models for 1) All ADRs, and 2) Listed ADRs both for the OLS regression (Panel A) and for the Tobit regression (Panel B).",
    "In the following section we describe how our principal dependent variables are constructed.",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Our paper differs from the studies described above on one critical dimension.",
    "To test these hypotheses, we create a unique database using a number of data sources.",

    "first model includes GDP per Capita and legal origin as the explanatory variables as reported in Table 5 .",
    "A discussion of the data and the variables follows in Section 4.",
    "See Karolyi (1998) for an excellent review of the ADR literature.",
    "4 See, for example, Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad, (2003) , Errunza, Hogan and Hung, (2000) , and Errunza and Miller, (2000) .",
    "The primary source for this data is Worldscope.",
    "This is constructed using the Morningstar database described above.",
    "This table shows the comparison between the set of firms in which the 111 emerging markets' equity funds invest, and the set of firms that are included in the Worldscope database.",

    "This suggests the following testable hypothesis:",
    "Related studies also find that firms with ADRs appear in better information environments that are then associated with higher market valuations and significantly larger market reactions to earnings announcements (for example see, Foerster and Karolyi, 1999 , Lang, Lins and Miller, 2003 , and Bailey, Karolyi, and Salva, 2002 , Doidge et al., 2004 .",
    "It is also interesting to note that the R 2 increases from 0.09 to 0.17 for all ADRs and from 0.04 to 0.20 for listed ADRs from the reduced model with only market development variables to the full model that also includes legal origin and transaction efficiency.",
    "18 Previous literature has shown a positive relationship between better firm-level attributes and financial and equity performance in developed and emerging markets (see, for example, Gompers, Ishi and Metrick, 2003, and Love, 2003) .",
    "The methodology and the major results are reported in Section 5.",
    "Another related set of studies reports evidence supporting Merton's (1987) \"investor recognition hypothesis\" which implies that as a firm gains recognition (e.g.",
    "However, Siegel (2004a Siegel ( , 2004b ) using a sample of Mexican firms, finds that crosslisting is associated with higher probability of asset stealing by controlling shareholders (thus causing significant wealth loss for minority shareholders).",

    "Panel B shows summary statistics of und holdings by country.",
    "These summary statistics suggest that a funds decision to hold ADRs versus underlying shares is influenced by country and firm level characteristics.",
    "These results are consistent with the commonly cited explanation by industry professionals which argues that transactionrelated factors play an important role in the choice of a firm's ADR security over the domestic security for an investor.",
    "The measures of liquidity are constructed using weekly trading data from Datastream.",
    "This finding is strongly supported when we run the regression for the subsample of firms that have listed ADRs.",
    "For example, Ammer et al.",
    "Panel A provides this information segregated by the number of companies held by the fund and those covered by Worldscope.",
    "We report the results for an OLS model as well as for a Tobit specification where the dependent variable is constrained to lie between -1 and +1.",
    "Also, while the ADR Ratio is usually reported by major databases (e.g.",
    "5 Miller (1999) and Errunza and Miller (2000) find empirical support for the market segmentation hypothesis.",
    "However, these results can also occur due to another well documented finding in recent studies that report that the level of a country's stock market development (e.g.",
    "For example, Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz (2004) find that foreign firms that list in the U.S. particularly those from countries with poor investor rights, have a significantly higher valuation than firms from the same country that are not cross-listed.",
