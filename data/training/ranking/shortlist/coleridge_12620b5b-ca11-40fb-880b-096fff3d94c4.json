    "The integrated analysis of data provided by these large longitudinal studies allows highlighting several issues that are of concern for research advancement, methodological outcome and finally for clinical practice.",
    "The main characteristics of these studies are all summarized in Table 2 .",
    "This issue is important when data coming from research studies like these are transposed and applied to daily clinical practice since IAs are commonly employed, at present, in clinical laboratories.",
    "While data on trajectories of sex steroids are almost available in all studies (see the paragraph above), information about the relationships among circulating sex steroids and/or various clinical aspects and physiological changes related to aging become patchy when moving across the various studies (Table 3) .",
    "Table 4 summarizes in detail the main analogies and discrepancies regarding the issues that have been mostly investigated by large cohort studies till now (Table 4) .",
    "At the beginning most of these longitudinal studies provided first analyses based on cross-sectional data.",
    "The Rancho Bernardo Study started as a survey of heart disease risk factors in adults who were older than 30 y and lived in the southern California community of Rancho Bernardo, that has progressively accumulated a lot of data (not only on CV system) from this cohort across the last 40 years 59,65 ( Table 2 ).",
    "Recently, data coming from the EMAS study confirm that age is correlated with the development of primary hypogonadism, but not with secondary hypogonadism, the latter being strictly associated to comorbidities rather than age.",
    "Data available on the relationship among aging, hypogonadism, and infectious diseases are scanty.",
    "The comparison of such kind of large cohort studies clearly remarks the great heterogeneity of outcomes, which differ for each study according to the peculiarity of the study design and the number and type of clinical and laboratory data collected.",
    "23, 27 In discordance with other studies, 27 the comparison between serum total T measurements by using IAs or MS, which represents the gold standard for T levels measurement, has shown similar, highly-correlated results in the EMAS cohort.",
    "htm) on the basis of CV events reported in some of the T trials.",
    "[53] [54] [55] [56] Previous data were contradictory and came from observational studies mainly based on inpatients with a poor health status, thus they were not representative on average of an aging population of men.",
    "62 By enrolling men also from Sweden and Hong Kong, the study has reached a considerable number of participants ( Table 2 ).",
    "37, 54, 57 After the above mentioned study, several other studies on large cohort of aging men were prospectively performed.",
    "[130] [131] [132] These data on mood 105 and cognition were also replicated by the RBS study, 133 and the HIMS 134 ; in particular the latter showed an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms in association to low serum total T 135 (Table 3) .",
    "Main similarities and differences of large longitudinal, cohort studies.",
    "This implies that the comparison of the results coming from different studies as well as the results of the same study obtained in different periods by using different assay methods remain challenging.",
    "Other than BLSA, also the RBS and the Troms\u00f8 Study are very old, being started in the 70s (Table 2) .",
    "At present, the gold standard LC-MS/MS is being used in all studies, while at the beginning of the studies sex steroids were measured by IAs.",
    "53, 61 The MrOS study is a multicenter study enrolling around 6000 men older than 65 y in order to identify risk factors for fractures in older men ( Table 2) .",
    "83, 92 Less data are available on sexual function in the BLSA and MrOS studies 97 (Table 3 ).",
    "3, 95 provided a lot of data on the relationship between gonadal status and sexual desire, sexual function, and erectile function in middle-aged to older men ( Table 3 ), suggesting that loss of sexual desire, but not erectile function, is strictly related to low T in aging men 96 and could be predictive for the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) 94 Thus, low serum T (the main component of low desire) is indirectly related to the onset of ED and to impaired male sexual function.",
    "[73] [74] [75] The study paid particular attention to the effects of age-related sex hormones decline.",
    "58 This is one of the biggest studies on aging showing T levels decline in men and its relationship with several aspects related to aging 4 ( Table 2) .",
    "53, 142 The longitudinal design of the studies came up progressively as the studies aged together with their participants.",
    "18 Data on the relationship between T and the cardiovascular (CV) system are available from the BLSA, 113 the MrOS, 114 the Troms\u00f8, 110, 111, 112 and the RBS, 115 showing that hypertension is associated to low serum T ( Table 3) .",
    "73 A strength of this project is the use of LC-MS/MS for steroid assays, which represents currently the \"gold standard\" (Table 2) .",
    "142 Subsequently, the decline of sex steroids was unequivocally proved when the data from longitudinal analyses became available.",
    "Vice versa no data on the decline of sex steroids were available in the InChianti study even though measurements of total T, E 2 and SHBG serum levels were available for the majority of men 67, 70, 85 in this study hormonal data were mainly used for investigating the association between circulating sex steroids and several conditions that are common in aging 69, 68, 67, 70, 66 (Table 3 ).",
    "The relationship between the decline of serum T and the worsening of sexual function has been investigated and confirmed by most of these studies ( Table 3 ).",
    "158 The studies on COPD, however, are scanty and have been performed on small samples of patients, thus more data from more studies are still needed to better characterize hypogonadism in older men with COPD.",
    "Of them, the main are: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), the European Male Aging Study (EMAS), the Rancho Bernardo Study (RBS), the InCHIANTI Study, the Troms\u00f8 Study, the Concord Health and Aging in Men Project (CHAMP), the Health in Men Study (HIMS).",
    "By taking into account all the issues mentioned before, it becomes clear that the comparison of the results coming from different studies suffers from bias due to methodological differences when measuring serum T and its decline during aging.",
    "Accordingly, the most important result reached by all the studies is to demonstratethe serum T decline with advancing age.",
    "12, 25, 33, 38, 49, 148, 154 Evidence coming from randomized trials in men older than 60 y is, in fact, still lacking and future large, prospective studies are required and worthwhile.",
    "7, 13, 23, 24 Even though it is well known that calculated free T overestimates the value obtained by equilibrium dialysis, 14 it remains largely employed both for research and clinical purposes.",
    "24, [27] [28] [29] [30] Accordingly, LC-MS/MS is able to lessen interferences, has better specificity, and reduce between-method bias.",
    "The CHAMP study was originally designed in order to investigate the health status in men older than 70 y living in a defined geographical region near the Concord Hospital in Sydney.",
    "51 Age-related male hypogonadism: Results from large cohorts studies involving middle-aged to older men One of the first studies investigating serum T in aging men by a longitudinal design was the New Mexico Process Study 52 that followed preliminary data previously obtained by cross-sectional studies.",
    "23, 29, 30, 33 Furthermore, in the last few years, LC-MS/ MS is becoming more and more available in the clinical setting and this evolving scenario is expected to be implemented, especially in clinical laboratories able to provide high throughput outcomes thanks to the procedural low costs that allows saving money for each assay and writing off expenses due to initial purchase of technological equipments.",
    "All these studies differ each other for several aspects, including the main aim of the study (that not always is specifically addressed to the study of sex hormones decline during aging), the involvement of subjects of both genders, the duration of the study, and the number of participants ( Table 2 ).",
    "Even though the comparison among all these studies goes beyond the aim of this review, we will try to report in a critical fashion the aspects that are more relevant for the comprehension of the relationship between sex hormones and aging in males.",
    "For some studies methods for T assay varied overtime during the long period of study protocol;^UK, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Sweden, Spain, Hungary, Estonia; EU: European;^^The main end point to be investigated in relation to aging; PLOC-B: Prospective, Longitudinal, Observational, Community-Based Study; MC-PLOC-B: MultiCenter, Prospective, Longitudinal, Observational, Community-Based Study; P-BRT: Population-Based, Randomized, Trial; n.d.: not detectable at any analysis; CV: cardiovascular; ED: erectile dysfunction.",
    "More recently, the CHAMP study showed a decline of serum total T around 2% per year 81 ( Table 3 ).",
    "The main aim of the study, however, was to evaluate the association between sex hormones levels and osteoporosis rather than overtime changes during aging (Table 2) .",
    "This correlation is particularly strong for free serum E 2 86,118,119 .",
    "The methodological approach used for T measurement has changed overtime according to advancements in this field in all the studies (Table 4 ).",
    "22, 153 or treatment for cancer 22 The issue concerning the relationship existing between morbidities and LOH is relevant since might to be bidirectional.",
    "59, 60 Among studies that have specifically investigated the decline of sex steroids, particularly T, in middle-aged to older men, the MMAS is one of the pioneering study, the investigation of sex hormones changes in aging being the main study endpoint (Table 2) ."
