    "(2016) and AfDB, OECD, UNDP (2014).",
    "The next section of the paper describes the conceptual framework and analytic methods underlying these findings.",
    "Source: Authors computation using data from EORA database.",
    "(2016) make use of the EORA database to estimate upstream linkages in GVC participation for countries in the region as the outcome of a range of control variables that are also of interest to this study.",
    "For this purpose, we use data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and estimate a linear probability model of firms' GVC participation:",
    "The report by AfDB, OECD, UNDP (2014), looks specifically at the role of GVC participation in the context of a strategy for the industrialization of an economy.",
    "This is followed by an account of the data sources in section 3 and how and why countries are classified in producing those findings.",
    "This section presents the main findings on the analysis of the association between natural resource endowment and linkages of countries to GVCs by comparing trends in natural resource rich countries as a group to that in non-resource rich countries and external comparators.",
    "Tables of regression results based on this alternative definition of participation in a GVC are available from the authors on request.",
    "The first column of the table indicates that each of the variables listed is highly correlated with bilateral sources of the import content of a country's exports as well as with bilateral destinations of where some of those exports are processed into further shipment to third countries.",
    "Furthermore, using firm-level data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys, the paper shows that the domestic actors in these linkages are typically relatively large establishments of 100 or more employees that have been in operation in for five years or longer.",
    "Results of comparison of GVC linkage rates and changes in these rates by country groups are described in Figures 1 through 9 , of which we highlight four main items.",
    "This pattern is depicted in Figure 2 , which shows an aggregate GVC linkage of rate of 45% for the non-oil resource rich groups in 2015 as compared with 37% for the non-resource rich group and 33% for the benchmark group.",
    "2 The database is a set of input-output tables covering 189 countries for the period 1990-2015, providing the largest coverage of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that we are aware of.",
    "Taglioni and Winkler (2016).",
    "* The reported results use data from the last two waves.",
    "Based on the EORA database (UNCTAD 2013), this paper shows that African economies have reasonably high rates of linkages compared with those of China, the rest of East Asia, Germany, India, the United States, and the rest of Western Europe across broad categories of manufacturing GVCs, including those in textiles and apparel, metal products, transport equipment, and electrical goods.",
    "This is consistent with the even stronger conclusion of AfDB, OECD, and UNDP (2014), also based on the EORA database, that in Africa as a whole -including North Africa -local manufacturers are more integrated into GVCs than domestic firms in agriculture, mining or services.",
    "As already pointed out, part of the cross-country differences in linkage rates within each group is explained by the factors highlighted in Table1 and Table 2 .",
    "This is evident in Figure 2 , which compares changes in upstream and downstream linkage rates between 1995 and 2015 across groups and shows that the overall rate of linkage fell by 7% for the nonresource rich group, while rising by 5 percentage points for non-oil resource rich, by 10% for oil exporters and by 1 % for the external comparators.",
    "A key component of the analysis in this paper is the estimation of a model of upstream and downstream linkages of economies across manufacturing GVCs by categories of natural resource endowment.",
    "The next three columns of each table show that the same variables explain some of the variations that countries within each group have in the rates of linkages to GVCs upstream or downstream.",
    "Antras and de Gortari (2016) provide a theoretical structure for such a model with implications for which countries in the region are more likely to participate in specific GVCs and at what stage.",
    "To compute the GVC indicators, we draw on the latest release of the EORA MIRIO database of the University of Sydney.",
    "Source: Authors estimation using data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys.",
    "Sections 4, 5, and 6 provide details of the findings.",
    "Parameter estimates are reported in Table 1 and Table 2 for equations (1) and 2respectively.",
    "Focusing on Figures 6 and 7, the rate of linkages in 2015 was substantially higher for the non-resource rich group in food and beverages and in textiles and apparel than for the benchmark group.",
    "The main working hypothesis of this paper is that natural resource endowment and economic geography are major influences on countries' linkages and role in manufacturing GVCs.",
    "The most recent analyses of GVC linkages in Africa include Allard et al.",
    "In practice, lack of firm-level data has meant that the measurement and analysis of GVC participation generally and for most African and developing economies particularly is mostly based on the use of projected inter-industry trade data to extract the value-added component of official data on country imports and exports.",
    "* p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.",
    "Part of the rationale for the choice of the four countries as external comparators to countries in Africa is that it permits invoking evidence in the literature on drivers of the differences in the experiences of the four countries to help explain trends in the region.",
    "Based on careful benchmarking of indicators of upstream and downstream linkages of local manufacturers in Africa to GVCs, the paper shows that they are reasonably high by the standards of other developing regions.",
    "It is worth noting that both sets of linkages developed in the 20 years leading up to 2015.",
    "In a similar fashion to the cases of the external comparators and the non-resource rich group, linkage rates of non-oil resource rich countries to the exports of China and India also developed in the past 20 years, during which downstream linkages to the exports of Western Europe and the United States increased significantly although upstream linkages to those two hubs did not increase or declined.",
    "4 An implication of the main prediction of the model in Antras and de Gortari (2016) is that coastal, larger or wealthier countries are more likely to attract downstream production stages in manufacturing GVCs than landlocked or poorer countries.",
    "In Figure 11 , the focus is on linkage rates of non-resource rich countries, for which rates are 2 to 3 times smaller than those shown in Figure 10 for the external comparator group.",
    "We preface those findings by the results of the estimation of the influence of other factors on GVC linkages through gravity equations (1) and 2, which provide a sense of why those linkages vary within each group of countries.",
    "It is also based on estimates of upstream linkages (the share of FVA in country exports) as well as downstream linkages (the share of DVX in county exports) for a wider range of two-digit or three-digit ISIC industries than those reported in Allard et al (2016) .",
    "China and India developed in the past 20 years, during which its linkage rates with the other regions also increased albeit by far smaller amounts, as shown in Figure 10 .",
    "In using the four countries as comparators to benchmark the linkages of economic activities in Africa to GVCs, we use population weighted average linkage rates of all four.",
    "The covariates include age group; employment size categories; foreign ownership (equal to 1 if there is any foreign ownership in the establishment and 0 otherwise); technology license (equal to 1 if the firm uses technology licensed from a foreign company and 0 otherwise), and indicators of industry classification.",
    "This paper aims to provide an account of both elements, along with an assessment of the role that cross-country differences in natural resource endowment and economic geography seem to have in explaining why they vary as much as they do within the region.",
    "In comparing these rates with those of African countries across the same international markets, it is important to note, first, that the larger shares of the linkages of the external comparators are downstream (or forward).",
    "This is shown in Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9, with variation across the group of external comparators, the non-resource rich group, the non-oil resource rich group, and oil exporters in that order.",
    "Population estimates for the Democratic Republic of Congo are obtained from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank, which is also our source of estimates of income per capita.",
    "One of the equations of the model, (1), specifies influences on upstream linkages on aggregate at the country level.",
    "As in the case of the four external comparators, the larger share of the linkages of non-oil resource rich countries are downstream although the group's upstream linkage rate is also reasonably high with China's exports at about 15%, and significant with those of the United",
    "Second, the group has relatively high rates of upstream (or backward) linkage with China's manufactured exports, which averaged about 30%, higher than the corresponding linkage rates to manufactured exports of India and the United States, at 10% each in 2015 ( Figure 10 )."
