  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "The stroke dataset was compiled as part of a study investigating white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in stroke patients [31] .",
    "In this paper, we present a method that combines the fast runtimes of learning-based methods with insights derived from classical methods for sparse data, to achieve both high performance and state-of-the-art accuracy.",
    "While the statistics for the stroke dataset shown in Table 1 were computed over the ventricle structures, the statistics for the simulated ADNI dataset were computed over 30 different anatomical structures as defined in the FreeSurfer protocol.",
    "The second dataset contains isotropic 1mm T1-weighted brain scans from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset [27] .",
    "We also use this data to do a direct comparison of the performance of our sparse version of cross correlation against the usual version of cross correlation.",
    "We demonstrate our method on a clinically acquired MRI dataset for stroke patients [31] and on a simulated sparse dataset derived from the ADNI dataset [27] .",
    "During pre-processing the scans for both datasets were intensity normalized, affinely-aligned, and skull-stripped using existing toolboxes [4, 21, 35] .",
    "This is often done in population studies, where inter-subject registration is a core problem.",
    "Importantly the fields Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",
    "In our experiments, we provide an analysis of this hyperparameter.",
    "We use this dataset to create simulated clinical scans as follows:\n(1) Simulating the variance in head positioning during acquisition by applying small, random affine changes to the isotropic image before creating sparse data.",
    "In our experiments, we focus on atlas-based registration, registering an atlas, or reference scan, to each subject scan.",
    "The improvement is statistically significant when using a paired t-test (p-value is 2.34\u00d710 \u221212 ).",
    "For the clinically-acquired stroke dataset, we compare our method to VoxelMorph (VM) [7] , Patch Based Registration (PBR) [13] , and the widely used Advanced Normalization Tools software package (ANTs) [4] .",
    "For VM and PBR, we used the optimal parameters given in the original publications, except for the cross correlation neighborhood size.",
    "Table 1 summarizes the average and median Dice scores for all test subjects on the ventricles, and the average test runtimes of each method.",
    "ACM CHIL '20, April 2-4, 2020, Toronto, ON, Canada themselves are used in clinical studies to understand anatomical differences between scans.",
    "This dataset has the advantages of having segmentations of 30 different structures in the brain obtained using FreeSurfer [19] .",
    "We used a modified version of the U-Net-like [30] architecture proposed in the original Voxel-Morph paper [7] , which is publicly available online.",
    "Eleven of these improvements are statistically significant with p-values < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 with a paired t test and three of these improvements are statistically significant with p-values < 0.02.",
    "Furthermore, state-of-the-art registration studies on high-quality, high-resolution MRI modalities have reported at most a ventricle average Dice score of 0.9 [7, 23] .",
    "Since the registration results across subjects exhibit high variance, as shown by the standard deviations, we show the Dice score for each subject in Figure 3 .",
    "This enables more detailed analyses on a variety of anatomical regions than is possible with the clinical dataset.",
    "We demonstrate our method on a clinically-acquired MRI dataset of stroke patients and on a simulated sparse MRI dataset.",
    "Figure 6 shows registration results for test subjects, illustrating the intensity heterogeneity present in these patients.",
    "For clinical neuroscience studies, accurate registration of clinical images is an important step in analysis [31] .",
    "The pairwise improvement in accuracy of SparseVM is statistically significant with a p-value of 1.60 \u00d7 10 \u221214 using a paired t-test.",
    "The algorithm used to register images in the population study reported on in [31] used flow fields generated by ANTs, a method that we show is much slower and less accurate than ours.",
    "Unsupervised methods [16, 18, 24, 25] have been shown to work well on research quality, high resolution scans.",
    "To our knowledge, this is the first use of deep learning based strategies specifically designed for registering sparse clinical images.",
    "The dataset contains manual segmentations of the ventricles for 104 of the subjects.",
    "Table 2 shows the average and median Dice scores for both Vox-elMorph and SparseVM with the cross correlation loss function.",
    "However, most registration algorithms are designed for high-resolution researchquality scans.",
    "However, from our experiments we found a larger neighborhood size of 15 3 leads to better performance for clinical images, so we report results with a neighborhood size of 15 3 .",
    "We provide an analysis below for this value, and report results for SLCC with a neighborhood size =15, which we found to perform well given the sparsity in our data.",
    "To our knowledge, it is the first method to use deep learning specifically tailored to registering clinical images.",
    "(3) by computing the loss over only observed voxels:\nTo define a sparse version of local normalized cross correlation, we first consider the sparsity of each local neighborhood of voxels.",
    "In the original VoxelMorph paper, a cross correlation neighborhood size of 9 3 is used.",
    "Since our primary aim is to achieve fast runtimes and high accuracy on clinical data, we first evaluate SparseVM and all baselines on the stroke MRI images.",
    "The clinically-acquired dataset contains T2-FLAIR MR scans acquired within 48 hours of stroke onset.",
    "We evaluate SparseVM on a neuroimaging study of stroke patients containing T2-FLAIR MR brain scans [31] and on a T1 MR brain dataset from the ADNI dataset [27] with simulated sparsity.",
    "In SLCC, special care must be taken to ensure the neighborhoods are large enough to contain enough non-zero voxels, but small enough to capture statistics of specific regions of the scans.",
    "The number of slices deleted was chosen to emulate the wide spacing in the clinically acquired stroke dataset.",
    "In both cases, the sparse cross correlation function outperforms the standard cross correlation function.",
    "Figure 8 also shows the percentage of possible improvement, based on the highest reported Dice score, over VoxelMorph that SparseVM achieves.",
    "The average Dice score on this structure was 0.236 for SparseVM and 0.231 for VoxelMorph.",
    "We hypothesize this is because the simulated dataset averages the Dice score over several smaller anatomical structures in addition to the ventricles.",
    "Finally we define the sparse local cross correlation as:\nSLCC computes the local correlation in each neighborhood between voxels that are observed in both scans.",
    "Since Spar-seVM is both fast and produces more accurate flow fields, its use in clinical studies, such as this one, can reduce errors in propagation of WMH maps and reduce the labor and computational resources needed.",
    "For the smoothness regularization hyperparameter , we used the value = 1 used in the original VoxelMorph papers to guide a parameter search."
