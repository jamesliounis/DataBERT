    "The model presented in this paper is based on the framework developed byAizenman (1998, 1999).",
    "(1986) and Helpman (1989a) .",
    "The analysis can easily be extended to consider the case where C is proportional to repayment; seeAgenor, Aizenman, and Hoffmaister (1998).",
    "The purpose of this paper has been to examine the implications of inefficient financial intermediation (taking the form of high costs of contract enforcealthough not as much as they would if they were to act collectively.",
    "2See Freixas and Rochet (1997) for a useful description of the costly state verification approach to credit markets.",
    "7As shown in the Appendix, results qualitatively similar to those derived below continue to hold in the case where the old debt has seniority.",
    "Section II describes the analytical framework, which combines the costly state verification approach pioneered by Townsend (1979) and the model of limited enforceability of contracts used in the external debt literature, as in Eaton et al.",
    "Section V draws some of the policy implications of the analysis.",
    "The lower panel of Figure 1 depicts the relation between optimal employment and the initial level of debt, as given by (16).",
    "8 Again, if default never occurs, we assume that e* is set at the lower end of the support of the distribution (e =-Cm) 6 Condition (7) is likely to be met for a large enough level of the initial debt D, or for a relatively large K relative to X.",
    "The figure also illustrates an important implication of the analysis: if, at the initial level of C, D* is the optimal value of initial debt (that is, the value for which dV/dD = 0), at the new value of C the initial D* will be too high because it will be located on the wrong side of the debt Laffer curve (point A').",
    "It has been used to examine a variety of other issues, including the real and financial effects of contagious shocks (as in Agenor, Aizenman and Hoffmaister (1998)), and the welfare costs of financial openness.",
    "The present setting differs from these other papers in that we assume that there exists an initial level of debt which must be fully serviced in good states of nature.",
    "In the lower panel, the relation between optimal employment and initial debt becomes also steeper beyond the threshold value D; the new optimal value of employment is determined at point E\", and is lower than fih, as established in Proposition 1.",
    "Finally, it can readily be established that an increase in the volatility of aggregate productivity shocks-which can be captured in the present setting by treating 3 as a uniformly distributed random disturbance-leads to a proposition similar to the one above, as can be inferred from the results in .",
    "Clearly, this value of E* can be less than the lower support of the distribution, -In that case,",
    "which implies that, as long as C is not too large, dE*/dnh > 0.1l We can state the following proposition.",
    "The present paper examines the implications of this type of inefficiency for debt relief in an economy in which there exists a direct link between bank credit and the supply side, through firms' working capital needs.",
    "Despite the stylized nature of our analysis, the foregoing results are useful to understand some aspects of the crisis in East Asia and the policy responses that it could have led to.",
    "IUThe condition that C is not too large is needed to ensure that we operate on the upwards-slopping portion of the supply of credit facing the economy, leading to the results stated.",
    "For simplicity of exposition, and because they would not modify the key results discussed below, we abstract from these considerations.",
    "From equations (A5) and (A6), it can be readily established that all the results summarized in propositions 1 and 2 given in the text continue to hold.",
    "To many observers, one of the surprises that surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the crisis was that the outstanding stock of private external debt, particularly in Korea and Thailand, was much larger than previously assumed (see Aizenman and Marion (1999) ).",

    "[_IhnhnhJ Applying the second-order condition for maximization yields",
    "It would be more involved, however, if some costs were asssumed to accrue after the information about the idiosyncratic shock is obtained.",
    "In particular, although reducing the face value of debt could make both lenders and borrowers better off-as emphasized by Krugman (1988) and Sachs (1989) in their analysis of the debt overhang in a more general context-a higher degree of financial sector inefficiency may prevent any welfare gain.",
    "where e*, the threshold level of productivity associated with partial default on the new debt, is determined by rewriting (6), using (11), as",
    "Consequently, the association between the contractual value of the initial debt and its expected value has the typical inverted U (or concave) shape that characterizes the debt Laffer curve (see Krugman (1988 Krugman ( , 1989 and Sachs (1989) ).",
    "which implies in turn that dfih/dC < o.12 So far we have not made any specific assumption about the distribution function of the idiosyncratic productivity shock, Eh.",
    "Proposition 2 An increase in Em, which can then be interpreted as a (meanpreserving) increase in volatility, reduces optimal employment.",
    "Let E* denote the threshold value of the productivity shock below which partial default (at the margin) occurs on the initial level of debt, that is",
    "Note that, in contrast to the original model in Agenor and Aizenman (1998), we do not account for aggregate shocks.",
    "Then, in addition to the results summarized in proposition 1, the following result can also be established.",
    "Finally, the expected market value of the initial debt is given by, for e > -V = DJ f(eh)dEh + J (XYh-C)f(eh)deh.",
    "This is captured in our framework by examining the impact of higher volatility on the shape of the debt Laffer curve.",
    "A large debt overhang entails indeed well-known economic costs, induced by both illiquidity and disincentive effects (see Krugman (1989) and Sachs (1989) ).14 In the context of our analysis, the short-termf employment and output costs associated with a debt overhang can also be substantial.",
    "Section IV analyzes the effect of a reduction in the efficiency of the financial intermediation process (characterized by an increase in contract ISee, for instance, thediscussion of the causes and propagation of the Asian crisis in Alba et al.",
    "To show that indeed dhh/dCm < 0 if Ch follows a uniform distribution, note first that S9 [-] = S9 [IIhnhlE] FRom 15,",
    "The reason is that the cost of credit depends on expected verification and enforcement costs, which in turn depend on the probability of default; for D less D that probability is zero and thus the level of initial debt has no effect on the cost of credit, as can be inferred from (12).",
    "To establish for instance that dfih/dC < 0, note first that sg [dnh] rsg hnhC 1dCj",
    "This is consistent with the assumption in our model of an \"initial\" level of debt that must be serviced out of current resources.",
    "In terms of our Figure 1 , the reduction in C could lead, for instance to a shift in the Laffer curve from an initial segment BL' to BL.",
    "enforcement and verification costs), an adverse expected shock to productivity, and higher volatility of productivity shocks, on the optimal level of debt.",
    "To the extent that asymmetric information problems tend to be exacerbated by crises (as noted earlier), and that as a result financial intermediaries in post-crisis countries may experience an increase in the cost of verifying and enforcing loan contracts, our model suggests an alternative response to a debt overhang-namely, financial sector reform.",
    "Although we do not have firm evidence that verification and enforcement costs of loan contracts increased in the region in the aftermath of the crisis, it is plausible indeed that such costs rose significantly.",
    "Proposition 4 An increase in em, which is equivalent to a (mean-preserving) increase in volatility, has qualitatively similar effects on the shape of the debt Laffer curve as those associated with an increase in intermediation costs or lower exrpected output.",
    "Under the assumption that the idiosyncratic shock Eh is uniformly distributed, the following proposition can also be established."
