    "In our sample, Binswanger et al.",
    "The level of aggregation depends on the objective of the study as well as the availability of data.",
    "This section is a review of empirical studies.",
    "It is somehow a supplement to previous literature reviews (Askari and Cummings, 1976; Bond, 1983; Chhibber, 1989; Rao, 1989, and Ogbu and Gwetibouo, 1990 ).i To evaluate different studies, we check whether they adequately deal with the issues raised above: effect of prices and exchange rates, ornitted variable misspecification, simultaneity variables biases, asymmnetric supply responses misspecification, and pooling problems when applicable.",
    "The problem of data comparability is not equally explained in many papers using cross section or pooled data.",
    "Oxford University Press, New York, 284 pp.",
    "(1984) is also similar to the above study in terms of variable coverage.",
    "(1987) in the previous section holds here.",
    "(1987) , all the studies examnined below (see table 3 ) are concerned with individual crop area responses and are of time series nature.",
    "Concerning the main objective, the literature uncovers some stylized facts underlined in other literature reviews.",
    "To corroborate, for example, the elasticities are 0.293 and 0.122 for precipitation and research/ha, respectively, in Peterson (1978) .",
    "4 Most remarks made here also concern studies found in these literature reviewvs.",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Section 3 reviews some empirical studies.",
    "(1987) are a model of good study in terms of variable coverage.",
    "To recall, most of the studies on supply response use a specification of the following type:",
    "In that respect, this literature review supplements the previous ones as it highlights questions that were left out or insufficiently dealt with.",
    "The overall framework of the study can be laid out as follows.",
    "There is an urgent need for quality data to undertake serious quantitative studies.",
    "Table 3 in the appendix reports the results of the inquiry.",
    "Following the literature, most of the authors model supply response in a single equation (or multiple equations) as follows:",
    "Although Peterson affirms that it does not find significant differences between DCs and LDCs countries, Chhibber (1988) indicates that there is a significant difference if one disaggregates further such as in comparing low yield countries with high yield countries.",
    "Data pooling brings about at least two sets of problems that are not always understood or well dealt with in the literature.",
    "For a more elaborated relationship between Gov-ernment spending and the RER, seeValdes and Pinckney (1989).",
    "Askari and Cummings (1978) elaborate very well on that.",
    "( World Bank, 1993, p. 2).",
    "(1987) .18 For studies using the Nerlove Model, lagged output (area) is significant where included and so are weather (rainfall) and technological change (captured by time trend).",
    "where i = 1,2,...n stands for country (or region), t = 1,2,..., T is the time period index, j = 1, 2,..., g is a variable index, Q is some output measurement, P is some price variable, X is a set of other explanatory variables, a, are country specific variables and iii, is the usual error term.",
    "The first part of the section deals with quantity studies; that is, those whose output is expressed in total yield or yield per acreage unit.",
    "Concerning the pooling issue, what was said about Binswanger et al.",
    "The inclusion of time trend instead of specific variables is generally justified on the ground of lack of availability of data or multicollinearity among variables.",
    "The problem of omitted variables seems to be present in some studies By using only lagged lsSome of the variables are wNTongly signed for diverse reasons.",
    "In a single country context, the aggregate output is obtained as follows' 2",
    "Panel: cross section and time series.",
    "(1987) contain an evidence of area expansion dominating yield increase.",
    "Maxwell and Fernando (1989, p.1689 ) summarize well the position of the protagonists (see references in that paper): (a) the introduction of new export crops and generally unsuitable practices lead to soil erosion, desertification, water pollution and salination; (b) \"cash cropping adds to the value of land and leads to land mining or the incorporation of previously uncultivated land, which is often unsuited to cash cropping\";",
    "In our view, the best empirical work in our sample which takes this problem into account is Lopez et al.",
    "Maitha (1969) estimates the area response for Kenyan coffee that depends on real producer price (Fisher lag: 1 to 4), lagged quantity of coffee, a dummy variable and a time trend.",
    "The problem with this methodology is that it is sensitive to the data period chosen.",
    "The studies based on the Nerlove methodology could be misspecified, as some relevant prices are missing.",
    "The findings underlined in the previous part are uncovered here.",
    "Frederick (1969) explains cotton area expansion by the relative price of cotton to price of coffee lagged one period (the two prices are also used separately in one regression) and a time trend.",
    "However, the same table indicates that with a restricted sample of annual crop producing countries the correlation between the two variables alluded to above is negative (in fact, not significantly different from zero).",
    "Indeed, linited evidence from Indonesia and Malaysia corroborate this fact (Barbier, 1989 (Barbier, , 1991 .",
    "-This is tentative as the results are based on two separate regressions.",
    "The impacts are -1.2 to -1.5, 0.11 to 0.15 and 0.74 to 1.0, for the degree of public involvement in input supply, the percent of government current expenditure and population growth, respectively, in Cleaver (1985) .15",
    "The primary objective of this paper was to review the literature dealing with the impact of prices and macroeconomic policies on agricultural supply.",
    "The second part is concemed with studies using acreage as output. \"",
    "In other words, this literature review stresses that our understanding of the quantitative dimensions of agricultural supply response is surprisingly weak given the importance of this assumed response to growth, poverty and the environment.",
    "Given the positive relationship between export crop price and food production Jaeger (1992) observes for a sample of Sub-Saharan African countries (see table 4 in Jaeger, 1992) , he claims that export crop and food crop are complements."
