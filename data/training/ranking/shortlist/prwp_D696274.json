    "This paper evaluates these efforts based on limited data accumulated over 1989-93.",
    "Table 6 reports the results of panel data regressions of import capacity on total grants (pure grants plus ODA debt relief), for the sample three groups of countries.",
    "Import capacity is defined later in the paper.",
    "*: Significant at 10 percent on one-tail test **: Significant at 5 percent on one-tail test ***: Marginal significance level of less than I percent Nevertheless, the last row in Table 8 reports a very interesting result, namely, that the correlation between the high group's import capacity and total grants is stronger than the one between import capacity and pure grants (see Table 6 ).",
    "The five major conclusions of the paper:",
    "The results in Table 9 , when compared with those in Table 7 , show that for the high group total grants are more significantly and positively correlated to multilateral net lending than pure grants, especially during 1989-93 ($0.06 per $1 of additional grants, with a marginal significance level-one-tail--of 9 percent; see Table 7 , last column).",
    "This result, based on an incremental analysis, is consistent with one shown in Table 5 (although the latter is based on a mean comparison analysis); that is, the high group appears to be favored by bilateral sources in several respects.",
    "During They conclude that:",
    "Two main conclusions emerge from Table 6 .22 First, the middle and the low groups are not significantly different from each other from a statistical point of view.",
    "IS For all data sources see appendix 3 below.",
    "The second section of the paper sets the stage by presenting the facts; that is, it analyzes the allocation of grants and bilateral ODA debt forgiveness during 1984-93 to the 32 countries in our sample.",
    "One major conclusion emerges from the analysis of Table 7 : Over the past decade and on an incremental basis, bilateral lenders have partially substituted total grants for new lending for countries that have not received significant amounts of ODA debt forgiveness.",
    "This paper evaluates the effect these initiatives had on recipient countries based on data accumulated during 1989-93.",
    "* The analysis carried out in the paper, both in terms of means and incremental (marginal) effects, shows that total grants have enabled all recipient countries to expand their import capacity.",
    "Table 8 reports the results of regressing import capacity on pure grants for the three country groups.",
    "2 1 It is important to note that rather than implying any causality running from the independent variable (grants) to the dependent variable (import capacity), as is the case in standard regression analysis, our results are intended to be interpreted just as simple correlations between the variables (for a methodological discussion see Appendix 2).",
    "Rather than establishing a model to test for certain hypotheses, the paper keeps a descriptive analysis.",
    "(1984-88) (1989-93) High group (7 countries) 0.260 0.370 (0.431) (1.019) Note: t-statistics are in parentheses.",
    "Furthermore, Table 5 shows (panel A) that for the sample countries as a group, import capacity increased by 75 percent between 1984-88 and 1989-93, an increase slightly smaller than the one occurring in pure grants during the same period (77 percent), and that in absolute terms the increase in import capacity was larger than the one occurring in pure grants ($3.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively).",
    "This possibility is studied next by looking at the correlation between total grants and different types of net transfers, classified by source.",
    "The analysis is carried out, first, by comparing countries that in recent years have received significant amounts of bilateral ODA debt forgiveness with those that have not and, second, by comparing the same groups of countries during 1984-88 and 1989-93 (bilateral ODA debt forgiveness surged in the latter period).",
    "(These regressions are reported in Appendix 5.)",
    "First, we rerun some of the regressions reported above, replacing total grants with pure grants as the independent variable and comparing the results.",
    "This result, which repeated consistently across several regressions, is illustrated by the plot of residuals shown in Appendix 4.",
    "In fact, the import capacity for the high group increased by only 45 percent between 1984-88 and 1989-93 despite this group being by far the largest recipient of ODA debt relief and also the group in which the largest increase in pure grants occurred (92 percent; see panel D in Table 5 ).",
    "All the relevant results are presented in Table 7 .",
    "The results include a more restrictive model (A), that forces the relationship to be the same for the entire sample period, and less restrictive ones (B and C) that allow for a break-point in 1989, when ODA debt forgiveness began increasing.",
    "This conclusion is important for the analysis in the next section.",
    "Source: OECD/DAC; World Bank, IMF.",
    "Several examples of this are provided in footnotes.",
    "The two-step approach provides a more comprehensive analysis mainly because it allows the use of the whole sample when rerunning the first set of regressions, which is not feasible when using ODA debt forgiveness as the independent variable because it is equal to zero for most of the countries in the sample during 1984-88.",
    "The previous results for the high group suggest that a crowding-out effect occurs between total grants and other sources of funds, as mentioned earlier.",
    "The analysis first compares countries that have received significant amounts of ODA debt forgiveness in recent years with those that have not, and then compares the two groups of countries during 1984-88 and 1989-93 (ODA debt forgiveness surged during the latter period).",
    "The analysis is carried out using a mean comparison and on an incremental basis (using correlations).",
    "296,636 334,530 The data on the ratio of international reserves to months of imports refer to all the countries in the sample.",
    "Within this context we analyze next how the mix of grants and ODA debt forgiveness is allocated across these countries; that is, we study whether there is a clear criteria or rationale for such allocation.",
    "The main conclusion from this section is that grants and ODA debt relief to African countries most likely have been allocated according to some intricate economic hierarchy-but one that is difficult to identify on an a priori basis]7 In fact, the relative allocation of grants and ODA debt relief among the countries in the sample consistently violates basic economic hierarchies such as level of absolute poverty, access to other sources of finance, and indebtedness.",
    "In fact, Table 5 shows that on average net transfers from multilateral sources increased between 1984-88 and 1989-93 for-all groups except the high group (see next section).",
    "In sum, the results above corroborate those presented earlier, that is, that countries in the high group have not seen a worsening in their import capacity-despite what they receive is mostly ODA debt relief-mainly because multilateral sources have replaced bilateral sources in providing additional lending.",
    "* Finally, when analyzing the relationship between grants and ODA debt relief and other net financial flows (transfers), we find that, private creditors have usually withdrawn money from the countries in our sample as grants increased.",
    "This possibility is analyzed further in Tables 9 and 10.",
    "First, there is a statistically significant positive correlation between multilateral net transfers (new lending) and total grants for both the low group and middle group (excluding Nigeria), which becomes even stronger during 1989-93.",
    "To study this possibility, which is most relevant for our purposes, we proceed in two steps.",
    "Indeed, the last two columns of Table 3 show that the middle group is suffering more from such drying up than the high group, yet the middle group received less grants and ODA debt relief than the high group.",
    "Also, we concentrate on the potential trade off existing between pure grants and bilateral ODA debt forgiveness,5 and we limit our analysis to the SPA countries, mainly because of data availability.",
    "We show only the regression for the entire sample period to illustrate the effect on the coefficients of excluding ODA debt forgiveness from the independent variable; we do not report results that were qualitatively the same as reported in Tables 6 or 7.",
    "Furthermore, the net transfer from official sources also allowed private creditors to withdraw resources at a rate of about $0.6 billion a year (panel A in Table 5 last column).1 7 It is important to note that, as suggested earlier, ODA debt forgiveness does not necessarily free resources to be used in importing more, and that it could also lead to smaller imports if substitution between ODA debt relief and other net flows takes place.",
    "Nevertheless, these results complement each other; that is, the one in the previous section reters to annuial averages over 1984-93, while the one discussed here refers to increments over time.",
    "It is important to note that the fact that the high group is less constrained than the other groups, in the limited sense of having pure grants covering a larger share of its import bill, does not contradict the previous finding that the increase in total grants did ,9 Total transfers comprise those froi iultilateral, bilateral, and private sources.",
