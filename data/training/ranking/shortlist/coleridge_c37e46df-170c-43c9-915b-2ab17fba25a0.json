    "The results presented in this paper are largely tables extracted to showcase the achievements of eighth graders from the participating African since the detailed results can be obtained in Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004).",
    "See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of the findings.",
    "Other bodies that played significant roles in ensuring the success of the study were: IEA Data Processing Centre in Hamburg, Germany; Statistics Canada, which was responsible for collecting and evaluating the sample and helping participants to adapt the TIMSS sampling design; and Educational Testing Service, which carried out the scaling of the achievement data.",
    "TIMSS-2003, re-named Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, followed the lines of TIMSS-1999.",
    "See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of the frameworks.",
    "The sampling plan for the selection of the participating students was developed with the help of Statistics Canada, which was also supportive in guiding the sampling process.",
    "The performance of all the students in all the countries that participated in TIMSS-2003 was taken into account when defining these benchmarks, which are described as follows: See Mullis, et al., (2004) and Martin, et al., (2004) for details of characteristics of the international benchmarks of science and mathematics.",
    "To obtain information on the context within which science and mathematics learning takes place, TIMSS-2003(like TIMSS 1995and 1999) developed a contextual framework to obtain information from curriculum specialists such as personnel from the Ministries of education of participating countries, students in participating schools, their science and mathematics teachers and their head teachers.",
    "It is the most recent in the series of IEA studies designed to measure trends in students' achievement in mathematics and science.",
    "To achieve this will require reliable and valid information obtained through systematic and collaborative research across nations.",
    "In the TIMSS framework, a design based on multiple matrix sampling technique was used to divide the item pool among a set of student booklets with each student completing one of twelve booklets containing both mathematics and science items.",
    "To provide a context for interpreting the achievement results, detailed information on students' backgrounds and attitudes towards mathematics and science, teachers' background, classroom characteristics and school contexts for learning and instruction, was gathered from the students taking part in the study.",
    "Following this, a combined comparative assessment of science and mathematics, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) was conducted in 1994-1995 for students at various levels of pre-tertiary education.",
    "The sampling process used in selecting students in TIMSS-2003 was the same as that used in the previous TIMSS studies.",
    "From the time of its inception in 1959, IEA has conducted more than 16 crossnational studies on achievement in a number of curricular areas including mathematics and science.",
    "Singapore, for example, where the best results were reported in both subjects, practices the use of technology.",
    "A comprehensive explanation of the scaling process has been given by Gonzalez, Galia and Li (2004).",
    "It is a large scale study involving Years 4 and 8 students in forty-six countries.",
    "There is also the need to carry out an indebt examination to identify the dimensions of the problem for information that would be helpful in policy decisions to address the issue across the continent.",
    "The paper examined the performance of the African countries -Botswana, Egypt, Ghana Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa -in TIMSS-2003.",
    "Questionnaires were developed for this purpose.",
    "TIMSS-2003 used standards, procedures and guidelines that ensured that country samples were of the highest quality, thus making achievement results comparable across countries.",
    "The use of psychometric scaling techniques based on Item Response Theory (IRT) makes it possible for population estimates to be generated even though students do not respond to all the items or even the same items.",
    "It was observed that students' performance in the two subjects were high in countries that were encouraging the use of the technology.",
    "IEA conducted its First International Mathematics Study (FIMS) in 1964 and the First International Science Study (FISS) in 1970-71.",
    "The results of TIMSS-2003 have not only shown that the African countries performed significantly lower than the international country mean and those in sub-Saharan Africa ranked lowest in the whole world, but also that the African countries are among those that make the least use of the technology in their science and mathematics curricula.",
    "Mathematics and science were again assessed in the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) and the Second International Science Study (SISS) in 1980-82 and1983-84 respectively.",
    "In 1999, TIMSS (also known as TIMSS-Repeat or TIMSS-R) re-assessed grade eight students' achievement in both mathematics and science in order to measure trends in student achievement since 1995.",
    "The content dimension defines the specific subject matter content of school mathematics and science.",
    "TIMSS-2003 mathematics and science achievement scales summarise Year 8 (JSS2) students' performance on test items designed to measure a wide range of student knowledge and understanding.",
    "The curriculum framework used for TIMSS-2003 has two organizing dimensions or aspects, a content dimension and a cognitive dimension, similar to those used in TIMSS-1995 and1999.",
    "It also provided rich information on the context for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science in African schools which could be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in teaching and learning of these subjects.",
    "TIMSS is a series of studies conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to examine student achievement in science and mathematics, two key curriculum areas that are fundamental to the development of technologically literate societies.",
    "TIMSS-2003 used this approach to generate the overall science and mathematics scores and the scale scores for the two subjects.",
    "Use of Technology: Computers and calculators.",
    "In this section, the achievements of eighth graders from participating African countries in mathematics and science are compared to that of students in some of the other forty-five countries that participated in TIMSS-2003.",
    "Ghana obtained low mean scale scores of 255 and 276 in science and mathematics respectively, placing the nation second from the bottom of the overall results table (Table 1).",
    "TIMSS-2003 has provided the participating countries in Africa with the opportunity to examine students' achievement in mathematics and science using an international yardstick and to compare this to that of other countries both within and beyond the continent of Africa.",
    "The authors' commitment to TIMSS-2003 stems probably from their desire to propel African economies through the development and use of science, mathematics and technology.",
    "This paper examines the performance of the African countries -Botswana, Egypt, Ghana Morocco, Tunisia and South Africa -that participated in TIMSS-2003.",
    "The population estimates are obtained through the use of IRTs plausible value methodology.",
    "In the studies, these broad explanatory factors underlying student achievement are classified under curriculum (Robitaille and Garden, 1996).",
    "This means that students responded to only a subset of the larger pool of items in such a way that each item was responded to by a representative sample of students.",
    "Based on this perspective of the educational process, TIMSS assessed, through context questionnaires, factors such as national and school context, classroom characteristics, teachers, curriculum and student characteristics that are likely to influence students' learning of mathematics and the sciences.",
    "Compared to other African countries that took part in the study, the performance of Ghana and South Africa were the lowest (Table 1).",
    "In particular, the performance of students from the participating African countries is compared to that of countries in Asia such as Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Singapore and Republic of Korea that were at the same level of development as Ghana in the 1960s.",
    "In this paper, only the findings regarding teachers' qualifications and the use of technology in the mathematics and science curriculum are discussed.",
    "The cognitive dimension describes the many kinds of behaviour expected of students as they engage with the content in school mathematics and science.",
    "It will also enable policy makers to identify the contextual variables that can be modified to bring about improvement in the learning and teaching of science and mathematics.",
