  "shortlist": [
    "Results for each dataset were combined in a Meta analysis allowing a test for between study heterogeneity (STATA METAN specifying a random effects model).",
    "The discovery GWAS meta analysis datasets used in the study contain large sample sizes (in total 54,162 for AD and 23,986 for serum iron status) and show both AD and serum iron measures to have a strong polygenic components 27, 31 .",
    "This study utilizes summary data from the two largest GWAS meta analysis discovery cohorts for both AD and biochemical markers of iron status (total sample sizes of 54,162 and 23,986 respectively [26, 30] ) to compute comprehensive GPS.",
    "Finally all datasets were combined in a mega analysis also controlling for study.",
    "The AD case-control cohort comprises the datasets shown in table 1.",
    "Because the analysis is restricted to those SNPs which are most highly associated in dataset 1, we also repeated the analysis with the iron GWAS summary statistics as dataset 1 (in case of a scenario where SNPs strongly affecting iron phenotypes had an effect on AD risk, but SNPs strongly affecting AD risk did not affect iron phenotypes).",
    "We carried out SECA analysis of large scale GWAS meta analysis summary statistics to examine the genetic overlap between AD and each iron measure using the default approach [38] .",
    "The AD GPS was generated in the target population based cohort using summary data from the AD GWAS meta analysis from the IGAP discovery sample consisting of 17,008\nAlzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls [26] .",
    "In the AD cohort data sets we tested for an association between iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin GPS at each P value threshold with AD case-control status using logistic regression (performed in STATA v11) controlling for age, sex, and four ancestry principal components.",
    "This method has been widely used, both confirming and refuting suggested causal relationships based on epidemiological findings [19] .",
    "We thank the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) for providing AD metaanalysis summary results data for these analyses.",
    "Analysis was carried out using logistic regression controlling for sex, age,four ancestry principal components and study.",
    "Using a binomial test we compared the AD dataset with each of the iron phenotype datasets in turn examining 144 SNP subsets (testing twelve P value threshold combinations).",
    "ADGC was supported by the NIH/NIA grants: U01 AG032984, U24 AG021886, U01 AG016976, and the Alzheimer's Association grant ADGC- 10-196728.",
    "We acknowledge the Genetics of Iron Status Consortium as the source of the iron meta-analysis SNP association data.",
    "The meta-analysis used effect size estimates and standard errors with a random effects model.",
    "In the AD cohorts a subset of samples have available APOE genotypes (table 1) inferred from rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.",
    "In brief, linkage disequilibrium based clumping was used to select SNPs in the discovery data, providing the most significantly associated SNP available in the target data set.",
    "Finally to confirm our findings using an alternative method we used SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) with only the discovery datasets, to examine whether SNPs found to be associated with the serum iron measures are enriched within associated SNPs with AD risk, and vice versa.",
    "Variants are selected from an iron GWAS meta analysis discovery cohort [30] (n=23,986) and tested in large independent target AD case-control datasets (n=9,251).",
    "We tested for an association with the following SNPs; HFE rs1800562, HFE rs1799945, and TMPRSS6 rs855791 using logistic regression under an additive model and then combined the three variants in a GPS.",
    "In the SECA analysis exact binomial statistical tests are performed to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs associated in both datasets for 144 SNP subsets from 12x12 P-value threshold combinations.",
    "The GWAS meta-analysis results for AD (meta analysis N=74,046) [26] and iron measures (iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin, meta analysis N=23,986) [30] were used to test for an excess of SNPs associated in the AD and iron phenotype data Due to the larger sample size the AD GWAS summary statistics were initially used as dataset 1, and each of the iron measures as dataset 2, providing the greatest possible power.",
    "In addition the GPS were applied to large samples with individual level genotype and phenotype data (For AD cases-control: 2813 AD cases, and 6438 controls (of which 4926 are unscreened for AD, aged 54), and \u22658751 for iron measures).",
    "The population based sample set comprises (a) adult twins, their spouses and first degree relatives who volunteered for studies on risk factors or biomarkers for physical or psychiatric conditions (N=8380); (b) people with self-reported endometriosis and unaffected relatives (N=830) [34, 35] .",
    "Previously an AD polygenic score analysis has shown that disease prediction accuracy is greatest including SNPs with P value <0.5.",
    "To investigate whether a similar effect exists for AD we tested a larger number of iron-affecting variants against the most recent GWAS meta analysis on AD risk.",
    "Therefore using SNPs below genome-wide significance will increase power to detect an association.",
    "In addition a recent study compared 42 traits or diseases with available large GWAS where among other findings the authors found evidence that increased BMI causally increases triglyceride levels [21] .",
    "Results shown for P\u22640.5 threshold only, but no significant association or heterogeneity between datasets was observed at any P value threshold.",
    "In the population based dataset we tested for an association of AD GPS and number of APOE \u03b54 alleles with peripheral iron measures (iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin) using Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithm (GEMMA) software [37] .",
    "Using Fisher's test we also tested for an excess of SNPs where the effect directions (BETA) are concordant between SNP subsets in each dataset.",
    "We used linear mixed model regression using the likelihood ratio test, including sex, age and four ancestry principal components as covariates and controlling for family structure using a genetic relatedness matrix estimated from genome wide genotypes.",
    "In the Australian dataset APOE genotype was estimated from imputed rs429358 and rs7412 SNP genotypes (Supplementary methods).",
    "Conversely, we test whether AD risk variants from a GWAS meta analysis of approximately 54,000 account for any variance in iron measures (n~9000).",
    "Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) based clumping was carried out on all SNPs in the discovery data, providing the most significantly associated SNP available in the target data set, in each region of LD (using PLINK clumping command with a pairwise r 2 threshold of 0.2 and a physical distance threshold of 300kb).",
    "Several studies previously reported an increased frequency of the HFE H63D (rs1799945) mutation in AD patients [25] , but these findings have not been replicated in the largest AD GWAS meta analysis [26] .",
    "GERAD was supported by the Medical Research Council (Grant n\u00b0 503480), Alzheimer's Research UK (Grant n\u00b0 503176), the Wellcome Trust (Grant n\u00b0 082604/2/07/Z) and German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF): Competence Network Dementia (CND) grant n\u00b0 01GI0102, 01GI0711, 01GI0420.",
    "The transferrin genetic variant C2 has been investigated and shown to have a small but significant association (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17, in a meta analysis of 19 studies [24] ).",
    "Including the GWAS meta analysis of biochemical markers of iron status [30] and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) [26] .",
    "There is large deviation from the expected distribution of association test statistics compared to observed values, with association signals observed far below the level of genome-wide significance (figure 1).",
    "Apart from the lack of suitable and adequately powered prospective studies, a limitation of observational studies is the inability to distinguish between causal associations and those due to confounding and reverse causation.",
    "GPS for serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin (log) were calculated in target AD case-control cohorts, using stage 1 summary data from the discovery sample of a GWAS meta analysis combining 11 population based studies of biochemical markers of iron status, with a sample size of 23,986 [30] using the method previously described ( [36] and supplementary methods).",
    "CHARGE was partly supported by the NIH/NIA grant R01 AG033193 and the NIA AG081220 and AGES contract N01-AG-12100, the NHLBI grant R01 HL105756, the Icelandic Heart Association, and the Erasmus Medical Centre and Erasmus University.",
    "A binomial test 'heatmap' plot is generated to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with an excess [observed(obs)\u2265expected (exp)] or deficit (obs<exp) number of associated SNPs, and empirical P-values (adjusted for testing all 144 subsets) are calculated via permutation.",
    "In addition we test for the converse scenario, whether those at a high genetic risk for AD have higher peripheral iron levels throughout life, using SNPs identified by the AD GWAS meta analysis discovery cohort [26] (from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, IGAP n=54,162) in an independent population based target sample with available iron measures (n=8893).",
    "There is evidence of interaction effects, which would not be apparent in GWAS meta analyses, involving H63D and APOE \u03b54 alleles where the combination appears to affect age of onset and, to a lesser extent, risk [27] [28] [29] .",
    "Group 1 is GERAD1 together with WTCCC21958 British Birth Cohort, Group 2 is AddNeuroMed (second batch) with DCR, Group 3 is AddNeuroMed (first batch) and Group 4 is ADNI.",
    "The investigators within IGAP contributed to the design and implementation of IGAP and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.",
    "The combined MR estimate showed a statistically significant protective effect of increased serum iron in PD, suggesting that over the course of a life time alteration in tissue iron homeostasis reflected by a decrease in serum iron levels is on the causal pathway in the pathogenesis of PD."
