    "As shown in Table 2 below, the rapid growth of the banks' loan portfolios in recent years (e.g., 44 percent in 2004 and 37 percent in 2005) should be monitored as it may expose systemic vulnerabilities in the months ahead.",
    "As Laeven (2004) notes, the introduction and design of a DIS is usually the outcome of a complex interplay between various political constituencies and stakeholders with often conflicting interests.",
    "6 The remainder of the paper will focus on analyzing how effective the new system has been so far, and which issues still need to be addressed.",
    "The paper starts with a brief description of the Russian DIS, followed by an overview of the banking system's structure and some observations on the sequencing followed for adopting the DIS and the political economy of its adoption.",
    "See Kane / Demirguc-Kunt (2001).20 See graph in Annex / This much reported decrease in Sberbank's share of deposits, for instance, seems to be more linked to the closing of more than a third of its branches since 2001, rather than to a weakening of its market leadership position.",
    "16 Obviously, these figures reported by the Central Bank must be used with caution in view of the adoption in mid-2004 of a new loan classification system, which for the first time introduces \"the principles of estimated recoverable amount on loans and qualitative judgments on borrowers' creditworthiness\".",
    "177-FZ of December 23, 2003.",
    "Although we are not faced with random samples, it is likely that due to deficiencies in the selection process Type II errors will dominate, resulting in too many banks being included in the DIS.",
    "29 Interestingly, these efforts are spearheaded by the DIA with the objective of raising the coverage levels as percentage of GDP under the Russian scheme to international levels and promote more savings.",
    "However, the real challenge has been its execution in view of the ambitious timetable set for the process, CBR's limited capabilities, the information problems faced, and above all, by the limited support offered to the CBR for a strict implementation of the strategy.",
    "25 Only time will tell the extent of Type I error (rejecting the bank solvency hypothesis when it is in fact true) versus Type II error (accepting a false hypothesis) in the selection process followed by the CBR.",
    "Anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign banks in particular have stepped up their acquisition efforts.",
    "The new explicit DIS may help to level the playing field somewhat, but expectations in this regard should be guarded.",
    "Source: CBR Banking Supervision report 2005, 2004 and 2003 In an environment like the one described above, deposit insurance can not, by itself, be a panacea and stimulate savings in the domestic banking system.",
    "7 The latter figure reflects the high concentration of individual deposits as well as the exclusion of all corporate deposits.",
    "22 SeeFaulconbridge (2004) and alsoBelianin (2005) 23 As evidenced by the recent tragic events leading to the assassination of Andrei Kozlov , CBR's First Deputy Governor in charge of banking supervision.24 See annual supervision report of the CBR.",

    "As shown in table 1 below, the Russian banking system still seems both highly concentrated at the top and very fragmented in the middle and bottom, as well as mainly centered in the wealthier Moscow-St. Petersburg corridor.",
    "28 It is therefore not surprising that one of the participating banks was already subject to a recent intervention by the CBR.",
    "Whereas some immediate and possibly temporary benefits can be attributed to the new DIS in terms of containing the underlying structural and solvency problems is some deposit-taking institutions, it is also potentially costly in terms of significant new fiscal contingencies.",
    "Business Week Online, July 26, 2004.",
    "3 The objective of this paper is not to review the pros and cons of deposit insurance systems, but to focus, rather narrowly, on the recent adoption of the DIS in Russia, the rationale offered, and the potential impact it might have on the stability and development of the Russian banking system.",
    "For instance, there is a need to review the approach selected for setting the insurance premium.",

    "The adoption by the Russian Federation of a deposit insurance system (DIS) in late 2003 was a significant development, although certainly not a novelty by international standards.",
    "In addition, the adoption of a DIS also has potential implications for the conduct of monetary policy and the design of other institutional mechanisms, in particular the central bank's lender of last resort facilities, as well as its impact on the risks faced by it as supervisory agency.",
    "22 Second, although the CBR responded effectively and in a coordinated way with other stakeholders in 2004, this episode revealed that the CBR's ability to resolve banks is limited (lack of legal tools), and there are deficiencies and huge risks 23 in enforcing prudential regulations.",
    "It closes with a discussion of areas requiring attention going forward.",
    "On the one hand, selecting a subset of institutions to include under the new insurance system would have a strong signaling effect.",
    "Further state support can be provided if required.",
    "34 There is little evidence indicating that this figure has changed substantially.",
    "According to CBR statistics, the quality of the banks' loan portfolios is low, with loans classified as \"standard\" accounting for a mere 48.2 percent of the total outstanding loan portfolio, compared to 90.7 percent two years earlier.",
