    "Six techniques are presented in the next section and perform their estimation on the data set from Hargeisa.",
    "Using the full consumption data simulations with respect to their relative bias and relative standard error.",
    "This step is followed by the actual data collection.",
    "After explaining the methodology in more detail in the next section, the performance of the methodology is assessed ex post using collected household budget data in Hargeisa, Somalia.",
    "Iteratively, these values are substituted with imputed values drawn from the posterior distribution estimated from the regression for .",
    "Christiaensen et al, 2010;Christiaensen et al, 2011.",
    "The item assignment to the modules should be based on either a previous survey or a survey in a related country with similar consumption behavior.",
    "Iteratively, the coefficients are updated based on re-estimation using imputed values for missing data drawn from the posterior distribution of the model.",
    "Comparison between responses for the same item in a comprehensive and an incomprehensive list would indicate a lower bound for response bias.",
    "The relative standard errors show similar results as for the estimation of the consumption ( Figure   5 and Table 4 in the appendix).",
    "Second, the approach relies on a structural model estimated from the baseline survey.",
    "Therefore, approaches were developed to reduce administering time to allow collection of consumption data with significantly lower administering time.",
    "Assuming that the context of a comprehensive list is a better estimate, the response bias could be corrected for.",
    "The correlation between consumption per capita and household size is still significant (coefficient: -0.03, t-statistic: -2.17, p-value: 0.03).",
    "In this section, the rapid consumption methodology will first be applied to a data set including a full consumption module from Hargeisa, Somalia.",
    "Based on ex post simulations, the approach is demonstrated to yield reliable estimates of per capita consumption and poverty using data from a regular household budget survey collected in Hargeisa, Somaliland.",
    "Subsequently, the results from the High Frequency Survey in Mogadishu are presented.",
    "Multiple Imputation Multi-variate Normal Regression uses an EM-like algorithm to iteratively estimate model parameters and missing data.",
    "This class of techniques applies a summary statistic on the collected module-specific consumption and applies the result to the missing modules.",
    "Analysis of rapid consumption survey data requires high capacity.",
    "15 Further research can help further refining the methodology and estimation techniques.",
    "It is important to emphasize that these models give a lower bound of the R2 compared to the models used in the prediction as the prediction models include the core consumption as explanatory variable.",
    "A new methodology is proposed combining an innovative questionnaire design with standard imputation techniques.",
    "The rapid consumption methodology is applied ex post to household budget data collected in Hargeisa, Somalia.",
    "An EM algorithm draws missing data from a prior (often non-informative) distribution and runs an OLS to estimate the coefficients.",
    "In the following, the average and the median are used as summary statistics.",
    "Previous consumption surveys in the same country or consumption shares of neighboring / similar countries can be used to estimate food shares.",
    "The reduced consumption and the median summary statistic as well as the multiple imputation techniques deliver good results for the FGT1 and FGT2 emphasizing that not only the headcount can be estimated reasonably well but also the distributional shape is conserved.",
    "The performance of the different estimation techniques is compared based on the relative bias (mean of the error distribution) and the relative standard error.",
    "With representing a vector of household characteristics and an error term assumed to be normally distributed with 0, .",
    "Hence, the iterative process is a Monte-Carlo Markov -Chain (MCMC) in the parameter space with convergence to the stationary distribution that averages over the missing data.",
    "This will be used to assess the performance of the rapid consumption methodology compared to the traditional full consumption.",
    "(FGT0) is 57.4% for the reference distribution.",
    "The first class of techniques simply uses summary statistics like the average to impute missing data.",
    "Comparing the reduced consumption approach with the full consumption as reference, the reduced consumption approach suffers from an under-estimation of the consumption (Figure 2 and Table 3 in the appendix).",
    "After data cleaning and quality procedures, 675 households with consumption data were retained.",
    "The model for food consumption retrieves an R2 of 0.24 while non-food consumption is modeled with an R2 of 0.16 (see Table 3 ).",
    "Multiple Imputation Multi-variate Normal Regression employs a Data-Augmentation (DA) algorithm, which is similar to an EM algorithm but updates parameters in a nondeterministic fashion unlike the EM algorithm.",
    "This would lead to high correlation between modules supporting the total consumption estimation.",
    "The results from the ex post simulation indicate that the rapid consumption methodology can reliably estimate consumption and poverty.",
    "Using the Hargeisa data set, 91% of food consumption (76% for non-food consumption) is captured in the core module.",
    "3 Douidich et al, 2013; SWIFT.",
    "3 These approaches estimate a welfare model on the baseline survey using a small number of easy-to-collect indicators.",
    "A household consumption questionnaire records consumption and expenditures for a comprehensive list of food and non-food items.",
    "The distribution for the missing data stabilizes at the exact distribution to be drawn from to retrieve model estimates averaging over the missing value distribution.",
    "Thus, the retrieved consumption estimate is consistent and -using the evidence from the ex post simulations -highly accurate.",
    "Thus, it is not surprising that the technique using the average as summary statistic over-estimates total consumption at the household and cluster level.",
    "Therefore, capacity building usually focuses on data collection skills with a long-term perspective to increase data analysis capacity.",
    "Due to the design of the questionnaire, the method circumvents systematic biases as identified for alternative methodologies."
