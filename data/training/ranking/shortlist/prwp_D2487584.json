    "Annex 1 discusses the variables and their source.",
    "The model developed below is from Fay (2000) and seeks to ask the question of what infrastructure levels will be required in the future, either as consumption goods, or as input into production function.",
    "Canning (1998) , shows that per capita infrastructure levels are nonstationary, which implies that running the regressions in levels may produce misleading results unless the variable variables used in the regressions are cointegrated.",
    "Table 4 presents the regressions that were subsequently used for the projections.",
    "To our knowledge, this paper is the only one that systematically tries to estimate infrastructure need across a cross section of countries and across a variety of sectors.'",
    "Nevertheless they compare well with other studies estimates, notably with data on public expenditure on infrastructure from the 1980s.",
    "Table 1 offers a quick review of access to infrastructure services across low, middle and high income groups, showing how infrastructure stocks or access increases along with income.",
    "Data on access to infrastructure are available for the year 2000 for another 34 other countries.",
    "For all but the mobile phone data, our data base is organized as an unbalanced panel with observations every 5 years from 1960 to 2000 and includes all independent low, middle and high income countries with population of more than 500,000 in 2000 for which data was available (113 countries).",
    "The purpose of this paper is to estimate investment needs in infrastructure.",
    "Also, there are sector studies that typically tackle one type of infrastructure such as one on energy by Moore and Smith (1990.)",
    "This number is somewhat higher than Easterly and Rebelo's (1993) finding that developing countries in the 1980s were spending about a quarter of their infrastructure investments on the power sector.",
    "Using best practice average prices as discussed later on in this paper, the world's infrastructure stock today can be valued at about US$ 15 trillion (table 2. )",
    "For water, sanitation and mobile phones however, we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal, and therefore run the regression on the world sample.",
    "Thus for mobile, we use an annual data base, of different \"length\" depending on the country (from a minimum of 1 in Sierra Leone to a maximum of 21 in Finland) For these regressions we added a variable called market maturity equal to the number of years the market has existed in a given country.",
    "This work would however greatly benefit from complementary studies, notably at individual country level.",
    "Thus, since infrastructure stocks tend to change reasonably slowly over time and have a long life span, we include lagged value of the dependant variable in the regression in order to increase explanatory power.",
    "This would reduce our sample size considerably since we only have up to eight time series observations, and the series are often incomplete.",
    "For lack of comparable data across countries, we excluded ports, airports, and canals -which represent a small share of overall infrastructure endowments -and oil and gas.",
    "In all cases, we ran regressions both on a full sample of up to 113 countries and then separately for low and middle income as one group and high income countries as another.",
    "We use the same macro model that links growth and demand for infrastructure services that was developed in Fay (2000.)",
    "A Chow test of structural change allows us to determine whether the estimated relationship is the same for developing countries and the high income sample.",
    "We therefore also estimated a version of equation 5that included urbanization and population density to capture the density effect and its impact on demand (both direct and through price.)",
    "We therefore expand our set of projections by using projected infrastructure growth rates for the region/income group to which an individual country belongs, and applying them to the 2000 actual infrastructure stock.",
    "For all but water, we obtain very high R2 (0.95 and above) which is our goal given that we want to predict infrastructure values as best as possible.",
    "All regressions include country fixed effects, which are not reported here for lack of space.",
    "Kao (1997) shows that in this case parameters estimates are consistent even if the estimated relationship is not a cointegrating one.",
    "The 1994 World Development Report estimated that developing countries spent on average 4% of GDP on 7Note however that we are much more confident about regional or income group averages than we are about individual country results.",
    "Like many study of its kind, it is surely broadly accurate in the order of magnitude that it projects -notably concerning the inability of private investment to satisfy demand in the near future.",
    "Dumniies for missing observations in explanatory variables were included but not shown here.",
    "The infrastructure variables we use are telephone mainlines (lines per 1000 person), mobile phones (subscribers per 1000 persons), KW of installed electricity generating capacity per capita, km of rail per 1000 person, km of paved road per km2 of land and percentage of households with access to water and sanitation.",
    "Traditionally, most of this was publicly funded: in the eighties for example, public investment in infrastructure was estimated at 4.3% of GDP in middle income countries (Easterly and Rebelo, 1993) .",
    "Aggregating over the population, national per capita demand of infrastructure service for consumption, lC, will then be given as:",
    "It is however substantially higher than Easterly and Rebelo's (1993) findings that in the 1980s, public investment in water and sanitation in developing countries absorbed about 0.4% of GDP in middle income countries.",
    "* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.",
    "In high income countries we also see a small decline -note that this is in per capita terms and need not therefore imply an absolute decline; Overall, the implication for the rail sector is not that no new investment will be taking place, but rather that it is more likely to take the shape of upgrading and rehabilitation rather than of an actual expansion of the network.",
    "This compares well with the estimates of Ingram and Fay (1994) who calculated that on average developing countries spend about 0.8% of GDP on roads (which certainly does not include full funding for maintenance.)",
    "This type of approach is indeed much better suited to producing aggregate results, which usually are fairly accurate, than it is to producing individual country predictions.",
    "Instead, since we want to use this regression for projection, our interest is to obtain the best fit possible and the highest explanatory power.",
    "These may be much more accurate inasmuch as they are based on individual country and sector data, although in many cases they are more \"wishlists.\"",
    "This paper sets out to estimate the change in demand for infrastructure services that will spring from the expected structural change and growth in income the world is expected to undergo in the next 7 years.",
    "Note finally, that for most types of infrastructure, the difference in access between poor and rich countries is much less than the difference in income (estimated here at about 63: 1.",
    "As a result, we have projections for up to 147 countries (water, sanitation and rail have poorer coverage.)",
    "Using OLS with fixed effects, we ran both the basic model described by equation 5 and an extended model that included density and urbanization on all 5 infrastructure variables.",
    "Thus, whereas we are reasonably confident on the overall estimates, we do not recommend relying on individual country level estimates except in a very indicative manner.",
    "Assuming a Cobb-Douglas, we can rewrite the first order condition as:",
    "One is to run the regressions on first differences, which Canning shows to be stationary.",
    "5 Note that the presence of fixed effects somewhat complicated the estimation of Chow test.",
    "Looking at the results of our projections, it appears that the largest increases in coverage will occur in telecommunications, particularly mobile phones (table 5.)",
    "Unfortunately, the data is simply not available to make such an estimate."
