    "The next section reviews related literature and describes the context.",

    "The available evidence on the impact of crises on resource allocation typically relies on aggregate data.",
    "Collier and Goderis, 2009, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta and Schweiger, 2008) .",
    "By using firm-level data to examine the impact of a major crisis on resource allocation this paper combines and contributes to several strands of literature that have evolved fairly separately up until this point.",
    "Third, cross-country studies based on aggregate data suggest that plant-dynamics are a key determinant of the depth and duration of crises (Bergoeing et al.",
    "Results are omitted to conserve space, but available from the authors upon request.",
    "Figure 4 displays the same decomposition using a 3-year time window used to minimize measurement error and avoid underestimation of the contributions of entry and exit.",
    "The results are consistent with the descriptive statistics presented in the previous section and other studies of firm survival in developing countries and this dataset (see Bernard and Sjoholm 2003 , Frazer, 2005 , S\u00f6derbom and Teal, 2006 ; size, age, and productivity all increase the probability of survival.",
    "Table 2 presents summary statistics for survivors and exiting firms, disaggregated by time period.",
    "The baseline regressions presented in columns 1 and 3 merely control for connectedness, while the extended specifications presented in columns 2 and 4 additionally include interactions between connectedness and productivity.",
    "Moreover, it is available for a larger number of observations.",
    "The results are presented in Table 11 .",
    "We use data from 1991-95 to predict the capital stock based on output, investment, material inputs, labor usage, ownership characteristics, whether or not the firm exports, province and lagged capital.",

    "Table 9 presents regressions that include a dummy for whether or not a firm is an entrant, interacted with period dummies and productivity.",
    "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
    "Row C aggravates such sample selection bias by excluding firms with, respectively, fewer than 30 (columns 1 and 2) and 50 (columns 3 and 4) employees and defining a firm as having exited when it either disappears from the data altogether or fails to report having more than, respectively, 29 or 49 employees in any of the subsequent years.",
    "McKenzie 2003 McKenzie , 2004 Fallon & Lucas, 2002; Manning, 2000 , Beegle et al.",
    "Columns 1 and 3 present OLS specifications, whilst columns 2 and 4 present Fixed Effects models, which effectively estimate deviations from growth trends.",
    "We use the data on political connections collected byMobaraq and Purbasari, 2008.",
    "13 The other explanatory variables are the same as those presented in Table 3 , although the first six columns exclude industry dummies, but control for a sector\"s financial dependence, competitiveness and contestability, proxied by the Herfindahl index, the \"natural\" rate of entry and of employment turnover.",
    "This paper uses plant-level manufacturing census data from Indonesia to examine the impact of the East Asian crisis on the process of creative destruction.",
    "Table 8 presents survival models that control for provincial level real minimum wages and allow their impact to vary over time (the baseline models presented in columns 1 and 3) as well as to interact with productivity (the extended specifications presented in columns 2 and 4).",
    "To ensure our results are not an artifact of measurement error, we have removed all anomalous observations from our dataset (see the Appendix for a detailed discussion on how anomalous observations were identified).",
    "(2004) for evidence of the importance of creative destruction in Taiwan, China and Colombia respectively), in their comparative analysis of harmonized firm-level data from 17 developing and developed countries Bartelsman et al (2004) conclude that reallocation dynamics in Indonesia are very similar to those operating in developed countries and other Asian economies.",
    "We augmented the data with industry-level measures of 6 While the Difference and Systems GMM estimators developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) are in principle capable of yielding unbiased estimates, these estimators are not well suited for our data; the difference GMM estimator is likely to result in poorly behaved estimates when variables are highly persistent as is the case with our data (for surviving firms the correlation between lnLt and lnLt-1 is 0.98 -both in crisis and non-crisis years), while the Systems GMM estimators relies on a mean stationarity assumption that is palpably undesirable in the context of a crisis (See Roodman, 2006 , for a discussion).",
    "The few previous attempts to empirically validate the predictions of the cleansing paradigm using firm-level datadiscussed in detail in section 2 -have either failed to examine changes in the reallocative process itself or suffer methodological shortcomings.",
    "The Indonesian Manufacturing Census (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) collected by the Indonesian Statistical Agency, BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik), provides the empirical basis for our analysis.",
    "Columns 1 and 2 use value added per worker as the proxy for productivity, whereas columns 3 and 4 use TFP, measured by the Solow residual.",
    "In fact, the census data suggest that manufacturing suffered its largest decline in 1997 already.",
    "Columns 3 and 4 furthermore demonstrate that the results are robust to inclusion of sector-year dummies, which control for sector specific shocks and also shield against the impact of using inappropriate deflators.",

    "First, to alleviate concerns that the weakened association between productivity and exit is an artifact of the difficulties of measuring productivity during turbulent times Row A of Table 4 presents models which use deeper lags of value-added per worker and TFP as our productivity proxy.",
    "Row A uses the connectedness measure that is based on the response of the Jakarta Stock Exchange to news about Suharto\"s health and the business networks of those adversely affected by this news, while Row B uses as a proxy for connections whether a firm had a Suharto family member on its board.",
    "Section 4 describes the data, while section 5 presents descriptive statistics on job flows and decompositions of aggregate productivity growth.",
    "Section 3 summarizes our hypotheses and explains our approach.",
    "On the one hand, the improvement in the contribution of the cross term in conjunction with the decreased contribution of the within term suggests that those firms that experienced the largest declines in productivity also suffered the largest reductions in market share, although the magnitude of the cross term may be upwards biased because of measurement error.",
    "The second column uses TFP estimated by means of the Solow method, while the third column uses TFP estimated by means of the ACF procedure.",
    "Although such analysis is scant, there are a few studies that shed light on the debate.",
    "8 For firms that enter in 1996, we use data from 1997-2000 to backcast their capital stock using the same set of explanatory variables (but using leads rather than lags where appropriate).",
    "To conserve space, we only report the coefficients on our preferred productivity proxies, but the regressions include all explanatory variables that are included in table 3, unless indicated otherwise.",
    "Incidentally, since lagged productivity measures are not available for entrants, this table also demonstrates that the attenuation effect is not solely driven by differential survival dynamics for entrants.",
    "The survey design impacts the definitions of key explanatory variables.",
    "The results are generally consistent with the literature on firm growth: younger firms, smaller firms and more productive firms grow faster (see for example, Bigsten and Gebreeyesus, 2007) .",
    "Comparing across columns enables one to examine how average productivity differences between surviving firms and exiting firms evolved over time.",
    "Tables 4, 5 and 6 present alternative specifications and robustness checks.",
    "In addition, we complemented the data with two measures of political connectedness constructed by Mobaraq and Purbasari (2008) .",
    "The graph resembles Figure 4 , although the relative magnitude of the decrease in the contribution of the within term is larger, whereas the improvements in the between, cross, and proportionate entry terms appear smaller."
