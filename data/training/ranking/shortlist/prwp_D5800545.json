    "The papers carry the names of the authors and should be cited accordingly.",
    "More specifically, in this paper we investigate the determinants of residential mobility in Bhopal, India, using a comprehensive household level data set.",
    "As reported in Table 8, average treatment effects based on kernel matching on the predicted z-score confirm the validity of the results of the previous estimates of regular savings impact on housing mobility.",
    "Summary statistics for all variables are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 provides the estimation results.",
    "(Table 7) Gaussian Kernel, bandwidth 0.06, bootstrapped standard errors",
    "We present several specifications.",
    "These results are provided in column 4 of Table 6 .",
    "We use a Gaussian kernel density estimator and a bandwidth of 0.06, along with bootstrapped standard errors (1000 repetitions).",
    "We use a standard probit model to calculate the propensity score for each observation in the participant and the comparison-group.",
    "The estimated parameter is statistically significant, which means that having individual water access in the previous dwelling unit is strongly associated with the probability of moving out of a slum.",
    "This is also reflected in our survey data from Bhopal.",
    "Looking at the distribution in Table 2 , we are interested in examining the factors that distinguish households who move out of slums from those who do not.",
    "where D i * is household i's net benefit from moving, S i represents savings behavior, H i is a vector of household characteristics, DU i is a vector of dwelling unit characteristics that influence the household's decision, and \u03b5 i is a normally-distributed error term with mean zero and variance \u03c3.",
    "Table 1 shows the distribution of our sample across housing categories encountered in Bhopal.",
    "We estimate (2a-b) as a probit model, correcting for unspecified heteroskedasticity, using data for the 779 households who lived in slums previously or who still resided in a slum during the survey period.",
    "Using household survey data, we investigated the determinants of residential mobility in Bhopal, India.",
    "This is the focus of this paper in which we investigate what enables people to move out of a slum area into the formal housing market.",
    "In the same estimation reported in column 4, we also examine whether the household's prior tenure status has any bearing on its chances of moving out of slums.",
    "Propensity score results are provided in Table 7 .",
    "To examine the robustness of the previous set of estimates, we use propensity score matching based on the probability of undertaking regular savings to construct a comparison group of households who do not save regularly (Leuven and Sianesi 2003) .",
    "Section 4 presents the analytical approach, followed by the empirical results of our analysis.",
    "Although the focus of our study is on a comparison of slums versus more formal housing, these categorizations hide considerable heterogeneity in the structural and regulatory characteristics of different types of housing supply mechanisms that are common to most Indian cities (see also, e.g., Sivam 2002 Sivam , 2003 .",
    "In addition to the variables used to predict housing mobility in Table 6 , we also include information on education, job security and assets while calculating propensity scores.",
    "Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that matching can be performed instead by conditioning on P(X)-i.e., the \"propensity score-alone rather than on X, where P(X) = Prob(D=1| X) is the probability of participating conditional on X.",
    "In the specification presented in column 4 we consider the possibility that households who have moved out of slums have positive unobservable attributes, such as innate ability, that distinguish them from households who did not move out.",
    "The Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues.",
    "In the empirical examination, we find that both these service measures are highly correlated.",
    "Figure 2 shows the distribution of welfare levels across households in six broad housing categories, where the welfare measure is per capita annual household consumption in Rupees.",
    "Titling activities can have well-documented beneficial effects (e.g., Lanjouw and Levy 2002 , Field and Torero 2002 , Field 2003 .",
    "In column 2, we report results fo r savings behavior after controlling for household characteristics, and in column 3 we add the skill level of the head of household.",
    "One would ideally like to match a participant with a non-participant using the entire dimension of observable attributes X-i.e., a match occurs if there are two individuals, one in each of the two samples, for whom the values in X are identical (Jalan and Ravallion 1999) .",
    "In this paper, we examined why some people manage to use the informal housing market as an intermediate step towards improved housing, while others remain stuck for generations.",
    "To address this problem, development agencies and national governments have supported a range of shelter related programs (Werlin 1999, Sivam and Karuppannan 2002; Mukhija 2002; Buckley and Kalarickal 2004) .",
    "A commonly used measure is the household dependency ratio defined as the number of non-working household members over those that are employed or self-employed.",
    "Life cycle theories of housing demand and savings also suggest consideration of household composition (Deaton 1992, Deaton and Paxson 2000) .",
    "There is also a growing body of analytic work showing that neighborhood attributes may affect economic and social outcomes through the behaviors, attitudes or characteristics of others who live within the same area.",
    "The estimated parameters show that regular savings are a significant and important predictor of a household's probability of moving out of slums.",
    "The structural equation underlying the observed behavior is a decision model where households choose to move, if the benefits from moving are higher than the benefits from staying in a slum.",
    "Our main finding is that in situations with limited access to institutional housing finance in general, and for slum dwellers in particular, the ability of households to save regularly significantly improves their chances for moving out of slums.",
    "This paper identifies characteristics of slum dwellers who manage to move out of informal settlements and discusses policies that may support this transition.",
    "While we can not offer conclusive evidence on why migrants may move out of slums at a higher rate, the survey information shows that migrants in the sample have higher educational attainment compared to natives, and most have moved to Bhopal in search of employment opportunities.",
    "We will not discuss the merits of these strategies in detail in this paper.",
    "Our model estimates the household's decision to move out of slums as a function of savings behavior and a set of other household and dwelling unit characteristics.",
    "The underlying intuition of using this information is that households who have higher ability would tend to sort themselves into slums with relatively better public services.",
    "The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the authors.",
    "We now turn to an empirical analysis of factors that explain why some households are successful in moving out of slums while others are not.",
    "We are particularly interested in the personal and household characteristics that enable slum dwellers to graduate to formal housing categories-in our survey sample, one in five households succeeds in getting out of a slum settlement.",
    "For instance, among households in public and private housing, between 43 and 58 percent of households report to save regularly.",
    "Residents were asked about the type of housing, tenure status, and access to basic services in their previous residences.",
    "For four cities in India in the mid 1980s, Lall (1989) shows that this proportion was higher in smaller towns due to lower overall incomes as well as the limited potential for institutional financial support."
