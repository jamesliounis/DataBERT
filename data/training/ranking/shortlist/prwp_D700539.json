    "2 Two papers that also try to answer this question are by Agell (1982] and Bond [1981] .",
    "Recent evidence 2 0 suggests that this would be reasonable to assume although it is clear that only country-specific information would be helpful in this regard.",
    "Of the 54 LDC tax systems described in a Price Waterhouse survey (19861, 27 Much of the current literature on capital formation and effective tax ratesl has concentrated on investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and statutory tax rate abatements as tax incentives (see, for example, King and Fullerton (1984] and Boadway, bruce and Mintz [1984] ).",
    "Although the theory developed in this paper could be easily generalized for this case, an empirical application would require measuring the the cost of funds for a foreign company.",
    "This is a useful result for empirical work presented later in that it can be assumed that a C6te d'Ivoire firm that is given only a partial exemption during the last three years of the holiday, would still prefer to defer its depreciation deductions.",
    "See Auerbach (19831 for a discussion of this.",
    "The remainder of the paper is divided as follows.",
    "This issue, however, goes beyond the scope of this paper.",
    "See Bartholdy, Fisher and Hintz [19871.",
    "XQ/ See Bartholdy, Fisher and Mintz [1987] who estimate that a point increase in the corporate tax rate in Canada is associated with a three-quarter point increase in the debt-asset ratio.",
    "This is a general issue that is relevant to the current effective tax rate literature as applied to LDCs.",
    "For a discussion on effective tax rates and adjustment costs, see Boadway (1988] .",
    "The discussion below applies j2/ As surveyed in Section II, several of the countries may give other tax incentives to non-tax holiday firms thus making post-holiday tax regimes different than the tax regime faced by associated taxpaying companies.",
    "If the firm uses retentions as a source of finance, the relevant tax rate is c. If dividends convey information to the market, the effective personal tax rate on equity income may be a weighted average of personal dividend and capital gains taxes (Poterba and Summers (19851) .",
    "This practice does not seem to be followed in the countries that are dealt with in this paper.",
    "Please contact Ann BhaUa, room N1O-06 1, extension 60359.",
    "The post-holiday period user cost of capital is the same as that derived earlier for equation (73) except that r is replaced by r 1 (the cost of finance is the weighted average cost of funds in the post-holiday period).",
    "where Rt -7ti(l-ut) + (l-7t)i(l-m)/(l-c), the weighted average nominal netof-corporate tax cost of equity and debt finance.",
    "Section IV presents some effective tax comparisons for the countries surveyed in Section II.",
    "Straight line depreciation is more common, as discussed in Section II, so depreciation rates were adjusted for the empirical work presented in Section",
    "The scant literature on this subject has concentrated on issues related to the reasons why tax holidays may be used as an incentive without trying to derive the effective tax rate on capital during a holiday (Bond and Samuelson [1986] and Doyle and van Wijnbergen (1984] ).2 The task of this paper is quite different.",
    "These calculations are meant to be illustrative only since we lack the data needed for a more careful measurement of the user cost of capital.",
    "-32-Although personal taxation and debt finance complicate the analysis, the results easily generalize.",
    "To take both of these factors into account the model must be revised accordingly.",

    "In the second part of this section, -12-",
    "The analysis of the previous section is repeated by finding the optimal choices for capital taking into account both personal taxes and financial policy.",
    "The corporate tax law reviewed above and outlined in Table I is the basis for modelling in the next section and for estimating effective tax rates in Section IV.",
    "The information on the tax provisions were taken from published sources so it is quite possible that the tax law has been misinterpreted in some cases.",
    "For example, the usual assumptions include the following: (i) real capital good prices increase at a constant rate over time, (ii) capital depreciates 1/ The notions of the effective tax rate and the cost of capital are fairly well known now in the literature so they are only briefly defined here.",
    "There are a few points that are worth noting.",
    "-28where ut-uO for t<t* and ut-ul for tMt*.",
    "Thus, the present value of tax depreciation allowances ls in part influenced by investment decisions taken in period t*-l even though the its income generated in period t* is fully taxed.",
    "In Section II, details regarding the tax law for five countries that use tax holiday incentives are surveyed.",
    "Deferral is preferred if Ad -And > 0, implying ul(#+Z) -uoZ[l-a]t*-t > 0.",
    "In this section, the user cost of capital and effective tax rates for depreciable capital investments undertaken during and after the holiday period are estimated for the five countries described in Section II.",
    "Table 1 provides a summary of various tax provisions in each country.",
    "For convenience, let At -A for t 2 t* since the present value of tax depreciation allowances on gross investment is shown to be time invariant after the tax ho'iday.",
    "The first part of this section is devoted to the simplest model that can be formulated to evaluate the impact of tax holidays on investment.",
    "-36-These results can be quite sensitive to the degree to which firms finance capital by equity.",
    "This suggests that an optimal debt policy may exist although differing in the pre-and post-holiday periods.",
    "These assumptions regarding financial policy may be used to derive a value maximization problem for the firm.",
    "(The latter source of finance is ignored to simplify the presentation.)",
    "The equity maximization problem is then converted into a value maximization problem which involves the firm discounting its cash flows by a discount rate that is a weighted average of the costs of debt and equity finance.",

    "Atuop + Z (uo + (ul uo)[(l.a)/(l+i)]t* t) for t < t*.",
    "In Table III If so, personal taxes imposed on domestic savers may only affect savings rather than the cost of finance faced by the firm that is determined exogenously in the international market.",
    "This argument can be elaborated upon by considering the following case which assumes that the post-tax holiday regime is the same that applying to all taxpaying firms.1 3"
