  "shortlist": [
    "The study followed a case study research design and interviews were used to collect the data.",
    "In each phase of the research, a set of problems was assigned to the study participants and the frequencies and percentages of their responses to the posed problems were calculated.",
    "The results in phase 2 of this study aligned with those found by Almeida and Bruno (2014) , which indicated that strategies used in solving problems may differ based on the type of the problem.",
    "The \"Participants Convenience\" sampling method was utilized to determine the study group (Merriam, 2013) .",
    "Table 3 represents the data collected from the participants' responses.",
    "The study used a mixed methods approach of quantitative and qualitative research by analyzing the collected data..",
    "These strategies fit the framework of the current study and can be used to describe problem-solving strategies demonstrated by the participants.",
    "The research collected was reviewed and presented based on participants in those studies addressing teachers' and students' strategies.",
    "All problems assigned in this study were generated and modified from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) exams.",
    "These strategies were classified according to the list given in the introduction of this paper (NCTM, 2000; Polya, 1997; Posamantier and Krulik, 1998) .",
    "The following table represents the frequencies and percentages of these responses.",
    "A clear description of the problems is provided in the findings section.",
    "In particular, the study aims to answer the following two questions.",
    "This study builds on the theoretical foundations of existing studies to present research focused on problem-solving strategies.",
    "The study results demonstrated six different strategies based on the difficulty of the problem and, in particular, based on the position of the unknown quantity.",
    "A literature review revealed a complex range of studies that reflect a need to develop mathematics teachers' problemsolving skills and strategies and indicate that these needs are varied and dependent upon specific domains (Bruun, 2013; Evans, 2012; Fang, 2012; Munroe, 2015; Tekin Sitrava, 2018) .",
    "Yin (2008) argued that a qualitative research design is used for in-depth investigation of the current situation in reallife contexts.",
    "The following classification was used to represent their responses.",
    "The participants' responses were analyzed based on their success in solving the problem.",
    "10 : The \"guess and check\" and \"organize data in a table\" strategies.",
    "Findings from the first phase showed a limited number of problem-solving strategies being used by the participants, which emphasizes the need for this study.",
    "In addition, the collected data was analyzed qualitatively.",
    "The qualitative approach was used for in-depth investigation to describe various mathematical problemsolving strategies demonstrated by participants across the three different research phases.",
    "The qualitative approach was used for in-depth investigation to describe various mathematical problem-solving strategies demonstrated by participants across the three different research phases.",
    "In addition, the results of this study were consistent with that of Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.",
    "The results in phase 3 of this study were consistent with those of Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.",
    "Figures 13, 14, and 15 represent some examples of participants' responses.",
    "A review of the literature showed a wide range of studies related to problem-solving skills and strategies for mathematics pre-and in-service teachers involving specific mathematical content or topics.",
    "In the final stage, the participant examines the solution they obtained.",
    "The findings of this study also agreed with those of Al-Balasi and Barham (2010), who concluded that using multiple mathematical representations enhanced students' ability to solve word-based mathematical problems.",
    "In the current study, the results showed an increased number of problem solving strategies being implemented to solve problem 2 in phase 3, such as \"use logical reasoning,\" \"guess and check,\" \"organize data in a table or a list,\" \"look for a pattern,\" \"solve an equation,\" and \"use arithmetic operations. \"",
    "In addition, Creswell (2007) suggested that qualitative research design is used to explore the solution strategies analyzed throughout different phases of the research.",
    "This result is in line with Ramnarain (2014) , who found significant improvement in problem-solving performance when a strategies-based approach to problem solving was implemented.",
    "A review of the existing literature reveals many different problem-solving strategies identified by researchers, including guess and check, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make a drawing (visual representation), work backwards, organize data in a table or list, use arithmetic operations, use logical reasoning, use symmetry, use a model, use a formula, and solve an equation (NCTM, 2000; Polya, 1997; Posamantier and Krulik, 1998) .",
    "This approach examined data before, during, and after the implementation of problem-solving mathematics lessons.",
    "The second aspect of the analysis concentrated on which problem-solving strategies the participants used.",
    "Research followed a case study approach throughout three phases.",
    "Some studies reviewed here also examined students' problem-solving strategies.",
    "For instance, Ramnarain (2014) examined the effectiveness of the strategies-based problem-solving approach on the problem-solving performance of grade nine mathematics classes in South African schools.",
    "A mixed quantitative and qualitative research approach was employed by analyzing the collected data throughout different research phases and describing the various mathematical problem-solving strategies demonstrated by elementary pre-service mathematics teachers in each phase.",
    "Here, the findings related to the following three problems will be presented and discussed.",
    "Analysis of the collected data also demonstrated that although some of pre-service teachers attempted to use other strategies such as \"make a drawing,\" they failed to reach the correct answer.",
    "In the final phase, a post-test was implemented to explore the development in participants' problem-solving strategies.",
    "The discussion of the study addresses different features and issues related to mathematical problem-solving strategies.",
    "The most success was in response to problem 1.",
    "On the other hand, more strategies to solve problem 1 were used in phase 3 than in the first and second phases of the research, reflecting an improvement in participants' command of different problem-solving strategies.",
    "This may be due to the type of the problem, as it could be solved based on the concepts of proportion and quantities.",
    "The techniques involved in solving problems are more closely examined by Polya (1957) , who identifies four stages, namely: understanding the problem, planning for solution, carrying out the plan and testing the results.",
    "The results in table 2 demonstrate that, in general, the pre-service teachers displayed more success in solving the posed problems during phase 2.",
    "In the first stage, the student needs to understand the words used in stating the problem, identify what he/she is asked to find or show, restate the problem in his/her own words, think of a picture or diagram that might help in understanding the problem, and then examine whether there is enough information to find a solution."
