    "This paper is structured as follows.",
    "Similar results hold after controlling for the background characteristics of respondents (see Table A8 in Appendix A).",
    "This section provides details about the data collection methodology and empirical analysis we conducted for the phone survey and online randomized survey experiment.",
    "Similar patterns exist when focusing on respondents' answers in terms of whether they have access to these information sources or what their main source of information is (see Figure A15 in Appendix A).",
    "Regression analysis shows that after controlling for demographic characteristics (sex, age, location, education level and household wealth) respondents that Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A).",
    "Similar results hold after controlling for the background characteristics of respondents (see Table A7 in Appendix A).",
    "The data collected from the phone survey were analyzed by identifying correlations and conducting regression analysis.",
    "The descriptive findings were calculated using household weights derived from the 2016-18 DHS to ensure the overall findings were broadly nationally representative, and throughout the paper household-weighted findings are reported on unless otherwise stated.",
    "The DHS is the most recent nationally representative data set including a measure of welfare and therefore this survey was used as the base for the reweighting.",
    "We use this second literature to feed into the conceptual framework used in the experimental component of our own research.",
    "In this paper we report on the findings of research studying drivers of vaccine hesitancy as well as research on ways of increasing people's willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine.",
    "This subsection presents broadly representative, descriptive findings from the phone survey and the control group in the online experiment, using the same approach to weighting (that is, inverse probability weighting at the individual level as discussed in Section 4.3).",
    "As we noted in the literature review, one salient fact emerging from existing descriptive studies on attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination, is just how much variation there is in vaccine hesitancy between countries (Africa CDC, 2021; Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) .",
    "Prior work on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has tended to involve either observational data from phone surveys (Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) or online experiments (Palm et al., 2021) in isolation.",
    "This figure is based on separate regressions controlling for background characteristics (see Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A).",
    "Regression analysis shows that after controlling for demographic characteristics (sex, age, location, education level and household wealth) the sources of information people relied on to find out about the COVID-19 vaccine were still unrelated to their willingness to get vaccinated (see column 4 in Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A).",
    "On the basis of this existing literature the following two hypotheses were chosen for testing in the experimental component of our study.",
    "2 This literature, while small, is the most relevant for situating the findings of our observation phone survey study.",
    "By drawing on administrative data based on the history of phone use in PNG, we were also better able to sample poorer respondents than would be the case by simply relying on random digit dialing, which is common practice in other low-and middle-income countries (Global Poverty Research Lab, 2020).",
    "To be able to make inferences about a broader population, it was necessary to weight responses to better reflect the demographics of the national population (such as age, sex and location) (see Table 2 ).",
    "The results were weighted to match the general population based on the most recent nationally representative survey that included a measure of household welfare, which is the 2016-18 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).",
    "This finding fits with a larger, pre-COVID global literature which found that people's contemporary willingness to be vaccinated is strongly related to past vaccine behavior (Brewer et al., 2017, p. 165 ).",
    "Among both survey groups combined (data are not provided in which health care workers are separated), concerns about vaccine safety were very prevalent (Pogo et al., 2021, p. 18) .",
    "Our data comes from a combination of a broadly representative phone survey and an online randomized survey experiment in Papua New Guinea (PNG).",
    "This is followed by an overview of the setting and methodology used.",
    "Reflecting the focus of this paper, and the availability of relevant research, our literature review here is broken into two parts.",
    "We draw on different survey platforms (that is, phone and online) to collect data about broadly representative samples of the population and they point to similar conclusions.",
    "The second body of literature involves either inference from observational studies or experimental evidence used for the sake of understanding the causes of vaccine hesitancy and learning about means of reducing it.",
    "The most significant published study of attitudes to COVID-19 vaccines across developing countries is that of Sol\u00eds Arce et al.",
    "The treatments in the online experiment were based on questions trialed in other settings and were also informed by the results of the phone survey.",
    "As mentioned in the preceding subsections, the phone survey was designed with the intention of household weights being used based on the 2016-18 DHS, which would allow for representative analysis at the household level about a range of COVID-19 related topics.",
    "Regression analysis shows that after controlling for demographic characteristics (sex, age, location, education level and household wealth) people who had previously been vaccinated were still not more likely to want to get vaccinated (see column 5 in Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A).",
    "After controlling for background characteristics of respondents, the treatment effect for the relative safety treatment is still large and statistically significant (see Table A6 in Appendix A).",
    "The five potential drivers of vaccine hesitancy, which are focused on one by one below, are discussed in the related literature section (Section 2).",
    "The responses provided by participants in the phone survey were weighted to match the characteristics of the 2016-18 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in PNG (National Statistical Office of PNG and ICF, 2019).",
    "Their paper reports on results from surveys conducted in 13 countries, spanning the Americas, Africa, South Asia, and Europe.",
    "Throughout the body of the paper, when reporting on experiment results, we present the sample average treatment results (that is, based on the raw data without weighting) unless otherwise stated.",
    "Positive treatment effects have been found in some studies (for example, Palm et al., 2021) , other experiments have failed to find clear evidence of the efficacy of information treatments (Brewer et al., 2017; Dub\u00e9 et al., 2015) , while some studies have found adverse effects, at least in certain groups (Nyhan and Reifler, 2015; Nyhan et al., 2014) .",
    "The relative safety treatment had statistically significant effects across most of the demographic characteristics of respondents (see Figure A18 in Appendix A).",
    "There is scope to build on our findings.",
    "These questions were sourced directly from a combination of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy surveys that the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO had undertaken in PNG or in other low-and middle-income countries.",
    "However, it is common practice for survey weights to be applied to online experiments to provide an estimate of how generalizable the findings are likely to be.",
    "We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings.",
    "The findings of this study will be relevant to other low-and middle-income countries where low trust and limited knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines exist.",
    "We follow this with a broader discussion on the generalizability of the results and areas for further research.",
    "To make comparisons between the insights that the phone survey and online experiment reveal about the general population in PNG it is necessary to apply a common approach to the survey weights.",
    "As a final step, the weights were raked to match the mean values from the DHS on the following characteristics: gender of the respondent, age group of the respondent, education of the respondent, household size, province, and urban/rural location.",
    "Regression analysis shows that after controlling for demographic characteristics (sex, age, location, education level and household wealth) respondents' level of concern about COVID-19 was still unrelated to their willingness to get vaccinated (see column 3 in Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A).",
    "To collect information about levels of vaccine hesitancy and what factors could be contributing to it, a phone survey covering 2,533 households was in the field from May 26 to June 6, 2021.",
    "In the next section we review the related literature about vaccine hesitancy."
