    "The statistically downscaled projections were based on data obtained from output of GCM CGCM3.1MR (Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model Version 3.1, Medium Resolution) [23] and downscaled to an 8-km grid.",
    "Climate data from 1971-2011 were used to construct the baseline species distribution models.",
    "doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096747.g005 considered acceptable, between 0.8 and 0.9 good, and greater than 0.9 outstanding [35] .",
    "doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096747.t002\nkm, 1-km, 2-km, 4-km, and 8-km.",
    "These data are available at a 4-km grid scale as monthly temperature and precipitation and were rescaled to an 8-km grid to match the scale of the projected climate data [19] .",
    "We term the statistically downscaled data ''CGCM'' after the GCM these data are based on, and we term the dynamically downscaled data ''WRFc'' after the mesoscale model these data are based on.",
    "We used statistically downscaled and high resolution climate projections.",
    "We used PRISM (PRISM, Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) data for historical climate records.",
    "The excluded data were used to validate the models created with these data: the ''main test set''.",
    "We created regional-scale SDMs for the U.S. PPR using Breeding Bird Survey occurrence records for 1971-2011 and wetland, upland, and climate variables.",
    "First, we only excluded consecutive years of surveys to reduce the influence of temporal autocorrelation and maximize information content: the ''main training set''.",
    "Statistically downscaled data refine projections from global circulation models (GCMs) using an empirical relationship to local physiography (e.g.",
    "We created species distribution models with the drought data to look at variable importance in dry years compared to variable importance for the whole study period (main training set).",
    "We created current predictions and future projections of probability of occurrence to each grid cell, for each focal species, by applying the SDMs to the baseline land cover and climate data (the 20-year period for baseline climate data being [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] and to baseline land cover and future climate data (the 10-year period 2040-2049).",
    "To assess model transferability, we predicted to the drought data subset using species distribution models created with the remaining wetter years [31, 32] .",
    "The result, we believe, is that the likelihood of correctly documenting the presence of a species was comparable across species, routes, and survey years.",
    "To evaluate each model's transferability -that is, to project to a new location or time period where predictor variables may be outside the range of the variables used to build the model -we projected to the drought period with models trained with data from the wet years.",
    "We indexed changes between predicted baselines and projected future distributions using change in a species' spatial distribution.",
    "Most models based on known distributional patterns were acceptable to excellent, indicated by AUC values (Table 2) .",
    "Model evaluation showing species prevalence (proportion of data points with species present) for each dataset, and predictive accuracy using the classification matrix and area under the curve (AUC) values.",
    "However, because of spatial variation in temperature regimes (i.e., warmer in the south, as shown in Figure 3 ), there were likely many individual grid cells in which future temperatures overlapped the historic range even if the study area yearly means do not.",
    "The high resolution models used the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) to set the boundary condition and a mesoscale model, Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to refine the data to a 36-km regional scale (J. Stamm, personal communication) [24] .",
    "The scales ranged from 335 ha to 32,200 ha and were based on buffering the segments with radii: 0.2-km, 0.4- The positive and negative rates show the models ability to correctly predict presence and absence data points in the withheld data based on a 0.5 threshold for classification.",
    "Bird occurrence data were obtained from 77 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes throughout the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.",
    "For the main datasets, model performance was not related to a species' prevalence according to Spearman's rank correlation (-0.09, p-value 0.62).",
    "The number of records in the main test set was 817.The number of data records in the dry years set was 139.",
    "The study was restricted to the four states because of available and consistent land cover and downscaled climate data.",
    "We obtained species occurrence (presence/absence) data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) [13] for waterbirds species with a prevalence of $ 0.05.",
    "Given that we expected high spatial correlation for monthly temperature and precipitation, we interpolated the 36-km data to the 8-km grid [25] .",
    "Building on these causal relations, Sorenson et al.",
    "To accommodate different timing of peak detectability by species, we chose either the first or third section for a species depending which section had Table 2 .",
    "The species distribution models predicted to climate data from 1981-2000 and 2040-2049 to create current and future projections, respectively, of species occurrence.",
    "Land cover variables, wetland and upland, collectively occurred as 67% of the top ten variables in the SDMs but comprised only 42% of the available predictor variables (Table 4) ; wetland and upland variables were 1.5 and 1.8 times more likely to appear in lists of top ten predictors than in the list of available predictors, respectively.",
    "We used data from high-quality surveys (reported by the BBS as ''run type 1'') for 77 routes: these were conducted within the correct survey window and not during poor weather.",
    "Thirty-one waterbird species had prevalence $ 0.05 and were included in the focal group ( Table 2 ).",
    "We estimated a species distribution model (SDM) for each waterbird species, relating BBS occurrence records to climate, and wetland and upland land cover (hereafter grouped as ''land cover'') predictor variables.",
    "Well-documented causal relations between past variability in wetland condition and extent and waterbird numbers provide insights to future change in waterbird populations under climate change.",
    "We chose Random Forests because of its high predictive power, ability to model unspecified variable interactions and correlated variables, its ranking of variable importance, and its demonstrated use for bioclimatic species distribution models [27, 28] .",
    "However, the inclusion of many collinear climate predictors is often warranted when causal links between specific climate predictors and species' distributions are not established, leading to better model fit and projections [47] .",
    "A grid point was determined suitable if the estimated probability of occurrence (over the time period for the baseline or future data) was greater than 0.5.",
    "Although the choice of the number of variables to report is arbitrary, we expect the top ten will provide an adequate basis for comparing models.",
    "Second, we separated out six years of data covering a drought period from 1987 through 1992 [21] .",
    "We created current and future predictive distribution maps for each species in ArcMap 10 based on an assignment of grid point locations as suitable or unsuitable.",
    "We included predictors related to suitable waterbird habitat quality, including the amount and type of wetland basins, and temporally scaled temperature and precipitation covariates.",
    "Our confidence is based on the overlap between the geographic extent of our survey data, the distribution of our focal species during the breeding season, and the timing of the surveys.",
    "Collectively, temperature and precipitation comprised 32% of the top ten variables across the 31 species, although they were 58% of the available predictor variables.",
    "We used the RandomForests package in R to create our models [29] .",
    "The frequency (y-axis) of variable type (x-axis) in top ten variables for waterbird species distribution models, grouped by species sensitivity to climate change.",
    "We found that when we reduced our 18 climate and 13 land cover variables to 14 uncorrelated climate and 10 uncorrelated land cover variables model projections were similar: 45% average range reduction for the full model and 48% for the reduced model (results not shown).",
    "Past studies in the Prairie Pothole Region that extrapolated from relations between climatic factors and wetlands inferred generalized habitat losses for waterfowl [5, 8] ."
