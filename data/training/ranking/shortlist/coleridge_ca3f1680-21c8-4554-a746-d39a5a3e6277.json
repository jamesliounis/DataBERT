  "shortlist": [
    "The latter is based on a cross-sectional web survey that was conducted in 2014 as part of the wider Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS) (see Keating and Kerr, 2013) .",
    "The transcripts of these interviews were coded using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) , allowing for both inductive (i.e., unanticipated themes emerging from the data) and deductive coding.",
    "As well as relying on two academic researchers for data collection, we also developed a small-scale participatory research project that recruited 5 young people to conduct interviews with their peers in their local communities.",
    "We illustrate these themes using the narratives and cases of specific individuals who distilled the wider patterns apparent in the data.",
    "The data is used here for descriptive, contextual purposes only (see Keating and Melis, 2017 for further analysis).",
    "This web survey was completed by 2,025 young people aged 22-29 in England, Scotland and Wales, and for the purposes of this article (and to match the qualitative data), we focus here on the responses from 1,003 young participants from England.",
    "Galland's analysis (2008) , meanwhile, highlights that levels of youth optimism vary considerably across countries, and posits that this optimism should be interpreted in light of current socio-economic conditions, historical legacies, welfare regimes and cultural characteristics.",
    "Combined, then, these empirical studies highlight the need to look at variation within and between countries, and to explore the individualization thesis with caution and through a highly contextualized lens.",
    "These ideas reflect wider neoliberal discourses about the power of human agency, and were most frequently manifested in our qualitative and our quantitative data by references to the importance of hard work when forging one's future.",
    "If others (e.g., France and Roberts, 2015; Franceschelli, 2017) have already highlighted how-during times of change and austerity-social class continues to shape the opportunities of young people, our analysis suggests that it can also influence their individual identity and sense-making mechanisms, as well as how they comprehend the social world (Franceschelli, Evans and Schoon, 2016) .",
    "The final sample includes 52 young men and 49 young women, 57 of whom were of White British origin, 19 of Black British origin, 16 British Asians and 9 of other ethnic origins.",
    "Although there is ample evidence to suggest that young people have borne the brunt of the crisis (Green, 2017) , other research has found that the actuality of these circumstances has had unexpected effects on young people's views of the future.",
    "Moreover, in line with previous surveys (Stellinger and Winterbert, 2008) , a majority of our respondents were satisfied with how their life has turned out so far (57% were fairly or very satisfied, while only 18% were fairly or very 'dissatisfied').",
    "In addition to this web survey, in 2013 and 2014, we also conducted 101 in-depth semi-structured interviews in England with young people aged 18-26.",
    "The CELS web survey (2014), which was conducted a few years after the start of the 2008 recession, suggests that a high proportion of young people in England have remained optimistic about their own personal future.",
    "In order to explore the interplay between young people's views (attitudes and orientations) and how their actual life experiences are shaped by their age, the socialinstitutional context and, more generally, their backgrounds, we draw on both qualitative and quantitative data.",
    "The young peer researchers were provided with training and support before, during and after their fieldwork efforts.",
    "Graduates were over-represented in this initial group, and to try to redress this, we recruited a further 34 participants using Twitter, snowballing, and by approaching Further Education (FE) colleges and youth organizations.",
    "In the US, for example, this has been illustrated by Silva (2013) , who has explored the effects of the ideological and structural changes on individual lives, focusing on the case of working class young adults.",
    "For instance, they may try to find a way to match this actual evidence with their existing cognitions and conceptions of the world.",
    "Evans's (2002) research in Germany and the UK suggests that institutions also play a key role in explaining these cross-national differences.",
    "Jamie, for example, had just completed a degree in accountancy, and he described his future with great enthusiasm: In keeping with the survey trends discussed in the literature review, however, it was more common for young people to express positive views about their 'personal' future and negative perceptions about the future of society as a whole.",
    "Beck's theories of the risk society and individualization (Beck, 1992a; Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002 ) have been particularly influential in this strand of the literature.",
    "Around half of the sample (50) were contacted as part of their continued participation in the CELS (see Keating et al., 2010) .",
    "In our 2014 web survey, we asked young people what they think it takes to get ahead in life, and as Figure 2 illustrates, hard work, ambition and 'having an education yourself' were the attributes that were most frequently seen to be 'essential' or 'very important' (83%, 82% and 79%, respectively).",
    "For example, Brannen and Nilsen's (2005) comparative study of young Europeans found that youth views of the future were not, in fact, converging towards individualization.",
    "This approach enabled us to collect a further 14 interviews, most of which were with youth that are often 'hard to reach', such as young people living in disadvantaged areas, with low socio-economic status, low skills and 'not in education and training' (NEET).",
    "These case studies, along with contextual information about their young lives help us to shed light on the ways in which young people talk about their future and make sense of the often-contradictory experiences of their lives.",
    "To illustrate this, Festinger points to the impact of information about smoking on smokers' behaviour: in striving for consistency, a smoker may start arguing that smoking is not as dangerous as presented.",
    "For instance, in their analysis of neoliberalism and education in Australia and New Zealand, Davies and Bansel (2007: 248) show how the marketization of the system-with a focus on employability, human capital and competition-has fostered the construction of 'neoliberal subjects' as individuals who are increasingly transferring socio-structural risks onto themselves.",
    "This macro/ micro split was exemplified by Anna, a young White British woman with a degree in psychology who was studying part time (for an MA in creative writing).",
    "While these theories have been influential in understanding how young people 'choose' and conceptualize their future (see, for example, Anderson et al., 2005; Vinken, 2007; Woodman, 2011) , others have argued that neither risk nor neoliberalism are able to explain the diversity of circumstances that shape the lives and views of young people.",
    "The participants in our in-depth interviews were recruited in several ways.",
    "Hence, we found that young people deployed their optimism and the related belief in hard work in different ways: for some, it was a reflection of their privileged access to opportunities, while for the most disadvantaged, it was an 'anchor of hope'.",
    "Hashim (a 22-year-old from a British Pakistani ethnic background) worked with us as young researcher and conducted several interviews with peers who were longterm unemployed, NEET and/or involved in crime.",
    "Beck (2007) claimed that this shift is part of the wider process of individualization taking place at a structural level.",
    "Thus, individualization has removed some old constraints, but it has also created new ones (Beck, 2007) .",
    "The young peer interviewers were identified by a national youth organization that had worked with the young people in the past.",
    "He also reflects Brannen and Nilsen's (2005) contention that youth choices are still shaped by their cultural background, and are not, as is often claimed, highly individualized.",
    "The importance of agency also emerges from Freya, a 22-year-old White European who graduated from an elite Oxbridge university and felt empowered to 'manipulate her future' through a combination of luck and privilege.",
    "Similarly, only a small minority asserted that race and religion influenced one's chances of getting ahead-in part, perhaps, because young people themselves are more accepting of racial and ethnic diversity, and they assume that society as a whole has a similarly tolerant attitude (Janmaat and Keating, 2017) .",
    "Our findings suggest that young people's views of the future were shaped by their deep-seated faith in the transformative power of hard work.",
    "There was a sense that personal connections and family resources played some role 'in getting ahead in life', but even those factors were overridden by the power of personal agency, as we also illustrate later.",
    "Questions of choice and agency also emerge in research that focuses on how the neoliberal paradigm-which has come to dominate many developed countries in recent decades-affects people's lives, values and beliefs (Jeffrey and Mcdowell, 2004) .",
    "More importantly, our in-depth interviews with Anna and others also shed light on what lay behind young people's continued optimism about their personal futures.",
    "These wider patterns were also apparent in our in-depth interviews with young people, some of whom who were brimming with optimism about their own life.",
    "However, we have also included a few outliers and extreme cases to highlight the diversity and disparity of experiences in the sample.",
    "Yet while Silva's participants continued to have faith in their intergenerational social mobility and the American Dream, Putnam's (2016) most recent work provides evidence of its inexorable end due to growing income inequality and the related rise in the opportunity gap between the rich and the poor.",
    "Finally, to reflect the regional differences in youth experiences, 34 interviews were conducted with young people living in the Greater London area, 44 were living in the north of England, 14 in the Midlands and 7 in the south of England.",
    "As Brannen and Nilsen (2005: 423) point out, many people 'find the external and structural forces that shape their lives more difficult to comprehend and therefore to talk about'."
