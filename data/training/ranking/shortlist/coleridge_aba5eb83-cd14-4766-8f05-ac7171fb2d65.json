    "For example, nearly all 18-month-long trials for mild or for mild to moderate AD used the ADAS-cog as the cognitive measure and the Clinical Dementia Rating or an ADL scale for the test for clinical significance (Schneider and Sano, 2009 ).",
    "The authors of that review on stroke therapeutics make several conclusions that are highly relevant to the AD field regarding alignment of preclinical studies and human clinical trials design.",
    "The National Institutes of Health has funded several prevention trials including Women's Health Initiative-Memory Study (WHIMS), the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT), Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEM) and PreAdvise (Craig et al., 2005; Kryscio et al., 2004; Martin et al., 2002; Snitz et al., 2009 ).",
    "However, available phase 2 data would suggest if these compounds are going to have diseasemodifying effects and improve the course of cognitive decline in this patient population, the effect is going to be quite modest.",
    "Given that these trials largely lacked ancillary biomarker and imaging studies, one can speculate that the trial participants who developed significant symptoms of AD in the first few years of such trials probably had significant AD pathology at the time of enrollment.",
    "One valid critique of the hypothesis is that most of the experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis comes from the study of the genetic alterations that cause familial autosomal dominant AD (Selkoe, 2001; Younkin, 1998) .",
    "However, current clinical trials designs have involved treatment of patients with AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment over generally 18 month to 4 year intervals (Schneider and Sano, 2009) .",
    "In any case, the knowledge-based, regulatory, and legal issues involved in using both validated and novel surrogate biomarkers for AD trials are substantial and require detailed consideration (Katz, 2004) .",
    "Next Steps: How Do We Collectively Ensure that Novel Therapies Are Tested in the Appropriate Populations?",
    "Based on current data, we know that APOE 34 genotype, low CSF Ab42, and increased PET amyloid tracer binding in the brain, all confer substantially increased risk for the progression of preclinical AD to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and MCI to AD (Blennow, 2004; De Meyer et al., 2010; Romas et al., 1999; Storandt et al., 2009) .",
    "Although biomarker-based trials can add substantial costs on a per subject basis to the trial, these costs might be offset partially or wholly by possible reductions in length of trial, reductions in sample size needed, or both.",
    "For example, some of the studies enhanced the likelihood for AD by choosing participants who were at higher risk or who already had MCI, outcomes were onset of AD or MCI, they had relatively short follow up periods of 4 to 7 years, and they did not incorporate the comprehensive biomarker or imaging assessments that are available today.",
    "Total costs for these studies are likely higher as they typically leverage infrastructure within the National Institutes of Health and participating academic institutions.",
    "The main support for the hypothesis has come from a convergence of genetic, cell biological, animal modeling, pathological, and biophysical studies.",
    "In the first stage, premorbid biomarkers for the pathology of AD would be used to select patients or enrich a sample for likelihood of progression to AD in a reasonable time-frame.",
    "Additional indirect support for the hypothesis has come from studies of other central nervous system (CNS) proteinopathies (Forman et al., 2004; Ross and Poirier, 2004) .",
    "As highlighted in a recent review (O'Collins et al., 2006) , out of 114 novel treatments tested in humans for stroke, only tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety in human studies to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "For AD, however, this would require demonstration that, for example, reductions in brain amyloid tracer due to an experimental drug are associated with subsequent attenuation of cognitive decline or improved quality of life.",
    "The Ab Aggregate Hypothesis Is Reflected by Biomarker Studies in Humans Recent biomarker and imaging studies in living humans, along with classic postmortem studies from Braak and Braak (1997) , the Religious Order Study, and other human studies (Bennett, 2006; Blennow, 2004; Jack et al., 2009; Morris and Price, 2001; Perrin et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2009) , have begun to frame a theoretical average timeline for the development of various pathological features that characterize AD and the relationship to initial diagnosis of dementia or prodromal dementia (i.e., mild cognitive impairment due to AD).",
    "The rationale for these anti-Ab therapies has been validated in preclinical models over the last 20 years and is rooted in the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Hardy and Higgins, 1992) .",
    "It is difficult to source the costs of an AD prevention trial for industry as only one such trial has been sponsored: a Ginkgo biloba extract study in France involving about 2800 patients over 5 years (Vellas et al., 2006b) .",
    "Collectively, these studies demonstrate a primary effect of genetic alterations that cause familial forms of AD is to alter Ab production or Ab itself in a way that promotes its aggregation and accumulation in the brain (Selkoe, 2001) .",
    "A recent report estimated that the current annual worldwide costs of care for those with AD is approximately 1% of the world's GDP (U.S. $600 billion/year; Alzheimer's Disease International, 2010).",
    "The 1%-2% of the population that is homozygous for the APOE 34 allele represents another at-risk or preclinical sample Neuron 69, January 27, 2011 \u00aa2011 Elsevier Inc. 207 Neuron Perspective for clinical trials (Reiman et al., 2010) , and being a homozygote increases risk for AD by 15 times compared to APOE 33 or 32 carriers (Farrer et al., 1997; Reiman et al., 2010) .",
    "In this regard, the British and Danish familial dementias are notable with respect to the parallels with AD in both clinical and pathological features and hypothesized mechanism (Ghiso et al., 2006) .",
    "This is clearly inaccurate, as to date, such trials were not definitive tests of the cascade hypothesis, but rather expedient ways to test potentially disease-modifying AD therapeutics in the current clinical, regulatory, and fiscal environment.",
    "If we can gain the scientifically based consensus among the many stakeholders, then we can collectively develop a road map that addresses the obstacles highlighted in this review that block conducting the necessary preventative studies.",
    "By insisting that preclinical data and clinical trial design are aligned, the likelihood of translational success in novel AD therapeutics might be increased.",
    "For secondary prevention studies, one might consider diagnostic biomarkers such as CSF Ab, tau, or both or imaging studies such as FDG-PET profile, brain amyloid load, or hippocampal or medial temporal lobe volume.",
    "Whether a therapy is safe enough will also be influenced by the conditions of use, whether one is considering a true primary prevention trial, a trial in preclinical AD, or a trial in established symptomatic AD, as the risk to benefit profile will shift toward tolerating greater risk with advancing clinical disease.",
    "Given that the typical genetic and sporadic forms of AD are very similar with respect to postmortem findings, clinical course, and evidence from the emerging biomarker and imaging cascade in sporadic AD, this seems a reasonable assumption (Shepherd et al., 2009) .",
    "Accumulation of Ab may plateau, though these observations are based on cohort studies and ongoing longitudinal amyloid imaging studies will be needed to validate both the time course and the kinetics of accumulation.",
    "We begin by summarizing both the current state of AD therapeutic development and the paradigm shift that is occurring with respect to being able to detect and track underlying AD-related pathologies in humans in the absence of significant cognitive impairment, as both of these issues are critical to how the dilemma has arisen and how we might solve it.",
    "Only this type of morbidity data will provide the evidence base for continued use of the therapy.",
    "These trials were designed in a manner that cost significantly less than current industry-funded treatment trials (Table 1) .",
    "Biomarkers and imaging, as discussed more extensively below, are likely to be essential for future prevention trials, perhaps to either exclude (primary prevention) patients with prodromal AD or select (secondary prevention) participants at risk for progression to symptomatic AD or for use as a surrogate outcome instead of assessing clinical status, and the costs and complexity will rise.",
    "Though the original amyloid hypothesis has been expanded to encompass the likely possibility that multiple different types of Ab aggregates (intracellular aggregates, oligomers, fibrils, and protofibrils) contribute to the cascade (Walsh and Selkoe, 2004) , the essential tenants of this hypothesis remain the same.",
    "Results from the first phase 3 study designed to confirm promising phase 2 results, unfortunately, showed no evidence of efficacy (Jones, 2010) .",
    "Although the human AD biomarker and imaging cascade is sure to be refined and advanced, the current data strongly support the following hypothetical scenario.",
    "This means that the usual chronic dosing studies in pre-or early amyloid-depositing APP transgenic mice with anti-Ab therapy must be accompanied or replaced by studies in which the mice have AD-like Ab loads at the time the treatment is initiated.",
    "These therapeutic advances, coupled with advances in early detection of ADrelated pathology in nondemented individuals, suggest that concerted translational research efforts focusing on prevention or early intervention could dramatically reduce the incidence and prevalence of AD.",
    "For example, presenilin-linked AD is associated with altered Ab42 production (Selkoe, 2001) , while APOE 34 is associated with decreased clearance of Ab from the brain (Holtzman et al., 2000) .",
    "Although we have seen remarkable and rapid advances in the ability to diagnose preclinical AD (Weiner et al., 2010) , in order to move toward primary prevention we need to advance our ability to predict who is at very high risk for AD and in what time frame they might develop observable pathology and subsequently clinical symptoms.",
    "For example, with an anti-Ab antibody-based therapy, a decrease in brain amyloid tracer retention with an Ab antibody therapy would indicate target engagement and thereby justify further trials.",
    "In a primary prevention trial, the endpoint might be time to conversion to a stage 1 biomarker or, for a secondary prevention trial, time to conversion of a stage 2 biomarker.",
    "These ongoing and planned trials should provide an answer to the questions raised above as to whether targeting Ab in symptomatic AD patients will have any efficacy at all.",
    "Therapies that have advanced the farthest have primarily been developed based on the proposed initiating role of amyloid b-protein (Ab) aggregates (Golde et al., 2010) .",
    "In reality, these aforementioned trials were not exclusively primary prevention trials, with varying mixtures of enrolled participants ranging from subjects without AD pathology to others with varying degrees of preclinical AD pathology and others with MCI.",
    "However, this will be challenging as biomarkers, imaging, or both will probably be needed to both select and stratify the sample population.",
    "Choosing such samples as familial early onset AD or people who are homozygous APOE 34 carriers as the intent-to-treat population also raises another issue, which is whether the expected action of the drug is influenced by the genetic makeup of the individuals."
