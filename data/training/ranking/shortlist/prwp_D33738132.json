    "See Tables A.6 and A.7 for the full set of results.",
    "These indicators are available in Appendix D,Table D.2 for the outlier countries identified in Section 3 of the paper.26 We are thankful to Francisco Ferreira and Beno\u00eet Decerf for encouraging us to delve deeper into this point.27 This decomposition is path dependent, meaning that the order in which we account for the various factors matters.",
    "We obtained these data from the June 2021 vintage of the World Development Indicators (WDI).",
    "See Tables A.4 and A.5 for the full set of results.",
    "See Tables B.12 and B.13 for a full set of results.",
    "Corresponding author: Christoph Lakner (clakner@worldbank.org).",
    "The weights are based on the relevant data set (N = 1,374) or subsample in question (N = 889).",
    "We use these lines with the 2017 PPPs in the rest of the paper.",
    "Notes: This chart is based on the data summarized in Table 1 , panel (C) .",
    "This paper is based on the June 2021 vintage of PovcalNet.",
    "(e) Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita: We use data on GDP per capita, denominated in 2011 PPP, 2017 PPP, and current USD, for the analyses done in this paper.",
    "Jolliffe and Prydz (2016) selected surveys conducted as close as possible to the 2011 ICP reference year, such that only one survey per country is used for deriving the IPL.",
    "We obtain a total of 1,438 country-year observations of national poverty rates from the World Bank's Poverty and Equity Database and the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) (see Table B .1 for more details).",
    "Section 2 describes the data we use.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "We then consider the subsample of all (n=815) country-year observations, allowing multiple observations per country capturing some within-country variation over time in their values.",
    "We use the CPI data used in PovcalNet (Lakner et al.",
    "We select for each country one survey that was conducted in 2017 or the closest year.",
    "For each country, we select the observation which is closest in time to 2017 (and refer to this as our circa-2017 sample).",
    "We use the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) from the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) for the latest available year, which is indicated in the table .",
    "First, we follow an approach similar to how we have updated the higher lines by replicating the methodology used to determine these values except now using the 2017 PPPs and more recent data.",
    "We use micro or grouped data from 1,971 income distributions in PovcalNet, which is the World Bank's database for global poverty estimates.",
    "Notes: This table shows equivalent poverty lines in column (3) that keep the global and regional poverty headcount ratios in column (2) constant in a pre-specified reference year (year given in column (1)).",
    "Panels (B) and (C) provide weighted medians and means for countryyear observations based on the income classification in the year in which the surveys were conducted.",
    "We follow these studies and impute rural and urban revised 2011 PPPs and 2017 PPPs for these three countries, using the share of price collection outlets in urban areas, the ratio of urban to rural poverty lines in the ICP reference year, and the national PPP as inputs (see Table B .4 for more details).",
    "The results for the world in column (3) are presented in the main text in Table 2 .",
    "For this paper, we use monthly CPI series from the November 2020 IFS vintage averaged into annual CPI series.5 We have verified this information with the revised 2011 PPPs.6 Countries that collect prices to compute PPPs as part of the ICP exercise are referred to as benchmark countries.",
    "Table 2 presents the results of the analysis described above.",
    "In several cases, this is because of country-level improvements in the data collection.",
    "We show that the IPL is robust to choosing a broader set of countries, a broader set of national poverty lines, and using an equivalent poverty line-a line that retains the global poverty rate in a pre-specified reference year (Kakwani and Son, 2016) .",
    "3 For most countries, the distributions use micro data from nationally representative household surveys.",
    "Panel (A) uses 2017 PPPs officially published by the ICP, except for 14 countries where alternative PPPs are used (seeTable B.3), while panel (B) uses only 2017 PPPs officially published by the ICP.",
    "2016 for a similar argument made earlier).",
    "Table 3 shows the estimated intercept and slope coefficients when considering three such specifications.",
    "Panel (B) excludes 7 lines derived from surveys conducted more than 10 years before the 2017 ICP reference year: AZE2001, COM2004, JAM2004, KIR2006, SYR2003, UZB2003, VEN2006.",
    "We use PPP estimates from the 2005, 2011 (original and revised), and 2017 rounds.",
    "When we update the analysis of with the revised 2011 PPPs, the median lines become $1.85, $3.21, and $5.65 (see Table 1 ).",
    "Notes: This table compares societal poverty in 2017 estimated with the revised 2011 and 2017 PPPs at the country level.",
    "Low-capacity national statistical offices often do so in collaboration with the World Bank.",
    "While the general approach of obtaining the price and expenditure data remains similar, especially between the 2011 and 2017 rounds, data quality assurance has been improved with the latest available technology, particularly in the 2017 round (World Bank 2020).",
    "Following Jolliffe and Prydz (2021) we regress harmonized national poverty lines on median values of consumption (or income, depending on the welfare aggregate used in the country).",
    "We identify and analyze three relevant indicators, including the CPI expenditure classification, the reference year for the weights, and the spatial coverage of the expenditure weights (also see Section 3.B and Appendix D).",
    "Second, the 15 countries were selected based on data showing that, for countries with per capita household final consumption expenditure at the level of these countries, national poverty lines were uncorrelated to per capita household final consumption expenditure .",
    "Finally, we include the 2017 reference year in the analysis, which is the year with the latest global poverty numbers at the time of writing.",
    "This method is attractive in light of the Atkinson Commission Report, which was concerned with future ICP rounds shifting the goalposts (World Bank, 2017).",
    "The solid red line uses 2017 PPPs officially published by the ICP, except for 14 countries where alternative PPPs are used (see Table B .3), while the dashed red line uses only 2017 PPPs officially published by the ICP.",
    "For the subsample of countries that use absolute poverty lines (i.e., those countries used in this analysis), Table 3 reports an average value of the delta ratio of 1.15.",
    "For 2017, we use the official 2017 PPPs for most economies, as published by the ICP.",
    "One might worry about using old harmonized national poverty lines given that the statistical capacity of most countries is increasing over time and given that using old poverty lines relies on many years of CPI data.",
    "Column (4) takes the $1.90 line as given for all countries and updates the $1.90 line with both PPPs and updated CPIs to the 2017 reference year."
