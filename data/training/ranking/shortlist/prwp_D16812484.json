    "Pollution data for all cities, where available, was taken from the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Environmental Data Bank website for the year 2008.",

    "A comprehensive review of such studies is provided in Ostro (1994) , Ostro et al.",
    "A World Bank study on China (2007), later cited in China 2030 (World Bank, 2012), applied a methodology for outdoor air pollution valuation similar to the one utilized in this study.",
    "17.8 million) and this figure was applied in the report.",
    "The figures summarized in Table 4 .1.",
    "Roy et al (2009) in a special study about lead phase out report that measured lead blood levels are still high in the Indian population.",
    "The estimates are based on a combination of Indian data from secondary sources and on the transfer of unit costs of pollution from a range of national and international studies (a process known as benefit transfer).",
    "This study attempted to provide indicative country-wide estimates.17 The same CO2 price is applied in China 2030 (WorldBank, 2012).",
    "This requires data on who is exposed, the health impacts of that exposure and the value attached to those impacts.",
    "These data are presented in Table 5 .2, along with unit figures for disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to illness and mortality.",
    "Ostro (1994) reviews worldwide studies and based on that Ostro (1998) estimates concentration-response coefficient for restricted activity days, and Abbey et al (1995) provides estimates of chronic bronchitis associated with particulates (PM10).",
    "In this study, financial costs have been used for a significant part of the analysis, but with social costs being reported wherever these could be obtained or estimated.",
    "The estimated annual cost of urban air pollution health effects is presented in Table 3 .4.",
    "Table A2 presents a summary.",
    "Based on the current status of worldwide research, the risk ratios, or concentration-response coefficients from Pope et al (2002) were considered likely to be the best available evidence of the mortality effects of ambient particulate pollution (PM 2.5).",
    "To estimate the health effects of indoor air pollution from the odds ratios in Table 5 .1, baseline data for ARI and COPD need to be established.",
    "Baseline health data for estimating the health impacts of inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene are presented in Table 4 .1.",
    "The estimated annual cost of rangeland degradation for the two methods is summarized in Table  6 .3.",
    "A summary of the values obtained, both in total and normalized in terms of Rs.",
    "Finally impacts of changes in fisheries were examined but it was not possible to value these in monetary terms due to gaps in the data.",
    "Cropper et al (2012) analyses direct emissions from coal burning power plants and applied annual average intake PM2.5 fractions.",
    "The mortality and morbidity coefficients are presented in Table 3 .1 based on these estimates.",
    "DALYs per 10 thousand cases of various health end-points are presented in Table 3 .2.",
    "Previous studies have estimated the use values for two categories: direct use value and indirect use value.",
    "Because of a lack of data, the losses here are approximated by the value of \"lost\" output related to the salinity, with some simple adjustment for changes in cropping patterns.",
    "This mainly reflects differences in terms of who is affected by the different pollutants but also the availability of data.",
    "The estimated costs associated with the impacts identified above are given in Table 4 .3.",
    "Concentrationresponse coefficients from Ostro (1994 Ostro ( , 1998 and Abbey et al (1995) have been applied to estimate these effects.",
    "Since excluding them from the estimation of health impacts would be a serious omission, annual average PM10 levels were assigned to these cities based on scaling up of the World Bank modeling PM10 concentrations (taken from the World Bank Internal Research Database), using an average factor for the major cities.",
    "In some cases, however, the figures may be based on damages in an earlier year if that was the latest information available (see later sections for details).",

    "In this report we used the average of the VSL and HCA values for adults (i.e.",
    "Under direct use value they have included: (i) Timber, (ii) Non-timber forest products, (iii) Fodder, (iv) Eco-tourism and (v) Carbon sequestration.",
    "Research in the United States in the 1990s and most recently by Pope et al (2002) provides strong evidence that it is particulates of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) that have the largest health effects.",
    "There is substantial research evidence from around the world that outdoor urban air pollution has significant negative impacts on public health and results in premature deaths, chronic bronchitis, and respiratory disorders.",
    "The central estimated costs associated with the impacts identified above are given in Table 5 .4.",
    "Studies of the cost of environmental degradation were conducted using a similar methodology in Pakistan, a low income country, and several low and lower-middle income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.",
    "Information of the salinity level (slight, moderate, strong) was not available at the time of the study.",
    "or 1.1 % of GDP in 2010 (Table 6 .2).",
    "The hypothetical value from which the estimates are based relies on the WHO methodology which uses conditions in developed countries as the benchmark.",
    "The outdoor air pollution losses were estimated for the inhabitants of cities with a population of over 100 thousand (due to data limitations); inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene costs were estimated for the whole population of India; and indoor air pollution costs were estimated for the households that use solid fuel for cooking (about 75 percent of all households).",
    "New techniques and methodologies have been developed in recent decades to better understand and quantify preferences and values of individuals and communities in the context of environmental quality, conservation of natural resources, and environmental health risks.",
    "This section examines each of these categories of losses with the available data.",
    "305-1425 billion, with a mean estimate of about Rs.865 billion (Table 5 .4) or 1.3 percent of GDP in 2009.",
    "Based on these figures total annual losses from degraded forest land and annual deforestation losses are presented in Table 7 .2."
