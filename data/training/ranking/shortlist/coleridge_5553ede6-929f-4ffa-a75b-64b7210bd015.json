    "The statistical procedures developed by Iceland and colleagues [35] were applied to the 2010 Census Summary File 1 race/ethnicity data and we aggregated tract data into counties to obtain the fifteen segregation measures for all US counties.",
    "In this study, we use the Tiefelsdorf and Griffith [51] approach; details of how to implement this approach can be found in Chun and Griffith [72] .",
    "We used R for all statistical analyses in this study [73] .",
    "Second, this study combined multiple data sources from different time points to explore the associations between the independent and dependent variables.",
    "Our findings provided some support to our hypotheses.",
    "We also computed the Pearson's correlation coefficients between mortality and all fifteen segregation measures in (Table A in S1 File) .",
    "Some future research directions can be drawn from this study.",
    "Since the main interest of this study is segregation (and the findings related to other independent variables, such as metropolitan status and income inequality, were similar to those in Table 2 ), we focus our discussions on segregation and spatial filtering results.",
    "In this context, this paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining whether racial/ethnic segregation and specific dimensions of segregation are associated with US county-level mortality.",
    "We used the findings above to examine the research hypotheses.",
    "Following our analytic strategy, we also implemented analyses by segregation dimensions and the results were summarized in Tables 3 and 4 .",
    "Comparing with the findings in Table 2 , two Segregation Dimensions, Race/Ethnicity, and Mortality additional eigenvectors, 21 and 17, were identified and they were shown in Fig 3.",
    "We will use 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) to obtain a set of social indicators and apply principal component analysis to reduce the total number of variables.",
    "Future studies should use other data sources to investigate the relationship among immigration, segregation, and health.",
    "Following Tiefelsdorf and Griffith [51] , we only consider the eigenvectors that are statistically significant and help to explain the spatial variation in mortality.",
    "The third hypothesis indicated that the spatial autocorrelation affects the estimates of the relationships between segregation and mortality and spatial filtering approach would identify the spatial patterns that are not only related to county-level mortality but also shared by various segregation dimensions.",
    "This pattern has been reported by several studies using a spatial perspective [8, 14, 48] .",
    "Specifically, in Tables 2 and 3 , we found that income inequality and social capital became non-significant determinants of mortality when using a spatial filtering approach, which contradicts several recent studies using other analytical techniques, such as spatial econometrics and weighted least squares modeling [7, 9, 55, 78] .",
    "This study reinforces the suggestion that when analyzing ecological data a spatial analytic approach should be employed.",
    "That is, once spatial structure is taking into account, the relevance of social capital and income inequality to mortality is reduced; as such, our findings contribute to the ongoing debates on these topics [60, 77] .",
    "To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a spatial filtering approach to examine the mortality pattern across US counties.",
    "Based on the Compressed Mortality Files maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics [53] , we created the 2004-2008 five-year average mortality rates that are standardized to the 2006 US age-sex population structure.",
    "After examining these eigenvectors (results not shown but available upon request), a fourth observation from our analysis is that the first four most important eigenvectors were the same across race/ethnic groups and they are eigenvectors 1, 6, 15, and 19.",
    "This hypothesis was confirmed as the OLS models tend to overestimate the importance of segregation (see both Tables 2 and 3 ).",
    "Overall, we believe that our hypotheses received some support, especially from the spatial filtering models.",
    "Drawing from the discussion above, we propose two substantive research hypotheses and one derived from our use of spatial filtering.",
    "The spatial structure underlying the data contributes to this overestimation as the spatial filtering models generated weaker relationships between segregation measures and mortality, and improved the adjusted R-squared.",
    "A recent study by Thayn and Simanis [52] suggested that the spatial filtering approach effectively minimizes spatial misspecification errors, improves model fit, and eliminates spatial dependence.",
    "Segregation Dimensions, Race/Ethnicity, and Mortality Table 2 presents the OLS and spatial filtering regression results by race/ethnicity groups.",
    "Pearson's Correlation Coefficients between Mortality and Segregation Indices (Table A) .",
    "The explanation for the statistical significance is that our eigenvector sets are optimal (based on statistical significance), rather than exhaustive [72] .",
    "In order to tie the spatial filtering procedures above to the OLS regression, one needs to incorporate a set of independent variables (X) into Eq (1) as follows:\nwhere X is a matrix containing the independent variables, which is the same X included in the basic OLS regression.",
    "As there is no agreement on which spatial weight matrix should be used, this study follows previous literature [9, 14, 48] to report the findings based on the first order Queen approach.",
    "However, as the goal of spatial filtering is to account for spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable, E can be created based on Moran's I [49, 51] , a commonly used measure of global spatial autocorrelation [69] .",
    "Last, as the spatial filtering approach aims to remove spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable, we conducted Moran's I tests to assess if the residuals of these models are still Tables 2 and 3 indicated that spatial filtering effectively reduces spatial autocorrelation by approximately 85 percent from OLS models.",
    "As the strength of spatial filtering is to identify potential covariates omitted in the analysis, our findings somewhat challenge the literature that income inequality and social capital matter for mortality.",
    "Coupled with the recent findings by Dinwiddie and colleagues [33] , we suggested that more efforts should be made to further understand whether the segregation between whites and non-black minorities can benefit population health.",
    "Specifically, the results in Table 2 suggested that higher levels of isolation between non-Hispanic whites and these two minority groups are associated with lower levels of mortality in US counties.",
    "The findings of this study will substantiate the utility of ecological mortality research, and contribute new material and perspectives on discussions of segregation and health.",
    "We would like to emphasize that these eigenvectors were already included in the spatial filtering models so it is not necessary to include new independent variables into the models, which is the advantage of applying the spatial filtering in empirical research [72] .",
    "Note that in the spatial filtering models, these eigenvectors were already included in the analysis and could be regarded as additional independent variables that represent the covariates omitted in regression but associated with mortality (e.g., migration trends).",
    "Second, most mortality research used the latest available data to explain the mortality differentials across social groups and long-term latency between disease onset and death has been overlooked [88] .",
    "To obtain unbiased estimates, researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance to take spatial dependence into account, particularly in ecological demographic studies [45] .",
    "The descriptive statistics and Moran's I values are shown in Table 1 .",
    "While the approach we adopt is commonly used [14, 35] , our findings may be subject to underestimated segregation indices [35] .",
    "While it is not clear what these covariates may be, they provide scientific insights into future mortality studies as researchers could explore what factors correspond to these spatial patterns [49] .",
    "We also expect that 1. spatial dependence will bias the estimates of the relationships between segregation and mortality and as such a spatial filtering approach can help refine our model specification and be used to identify the spatial patterns.",
    "To fill this gap, we obtained two reliable population health measures from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute [65] : average unhealthy days per month of the population in a county and the adult obesity rate.",
    "Since the dependent variable of this study is continuous, we discuss the eigenvector spatial filtering approach under the OLS framework.",
    "The reliability and validity of these measures have been examined by CDC and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute."
