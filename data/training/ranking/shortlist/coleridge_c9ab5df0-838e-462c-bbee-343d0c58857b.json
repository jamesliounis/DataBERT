    "Therefore, it makes a significant contribution to the current literature on research participation.",
    "www.cts-journal.com Table 2 Unadjusted associations between past participation, past opportunity, and willingness to participate and sociodemographic characteristics, access to care, and health status   Data Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015.",
    "This study used the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted in Arkansas as its data source.",
    "Statistical analysis SAS v. 9.4 19 (Cary, NC) was used to conduct statistical analyses.",
    "The study adds key insights into the factors associated with research participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate.",
    "Table 3 shows the results of multivariable logistic regression models for \"ever participated in health research\" and \"opportunity to participate in health research.\"",
    "Table 4 shows the results of the multinomial logistic regression model for willingness to participate in health research.",
    "[6][7][8] Furthermore, prior research suggests that participation in health research is disproportionate across races and ethnicities.",
    "PROC SURVEYLOGIS-TIC was used to accommodate the complex survey design in these analyses and estimate adjusted associations.",
    "This is the first study to examine factors related to research participation, opportunity, and willingness in a large representative sample in a relatively rural and diverse state.",
    "To describe the study population, weighted proportions for each dependent and independent variable were computed using PROC SURVEYFREQ to account for the complex sample design of the BRFSS.",
    "Race/ethnicity was not found to be significantly associated with past participation and past opportunity to participate in health research; however, a significant association between race/ethnicity and willingness to participate in health research was seen (\u03c7 2 R-S (6) = 22.53, P = 0.001).",
    "To account for the complex sampling design of the survey, the Rao-Scott Chi-Square test 20 (\u03c7 2 R-S )-a modified version of the chi-square test-was used.",
    "This will be the first study of its kind to examine factors related to participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate in health research from a large representative sample in a rural and diverse state.",
    "The current study investigated associations between key factors (rural/urban, race/ethnicity, age, education, poverty level, employment status, marital status, access to health care, and health status) and i) health research participation, ii) opportunities to participate in health research, and iii) willingness to participate in health research from a representative sample of adults in Arkansas.",
    "Significant associations were observed between willingness to participate in health research and poverty level (\u03c7 2 The inability to afford health services and willingness to participate in health research were significantly associated (\u03c7 2 R-S (2) = 7.71, P = 0.02).",
    "Only level of education was found to be associated with past participation in health research (\u03c7 2 R-S (2) = 34.59, P < 0.001).",
    "Prior studies on research participation have focused on one study or one population and have been conducted without inclusion of a representative sample of minorities and rural populations.",
    "These variables were captured by the following questions: i) \"Have you ever participated in any kind of health research study?",
    "Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the unadjusted significant associations continued after adjustment of covariates in the models.",
    "In adjusted models, significant associations between level of education and past participation held.",
    "Furthermore, the study investigated the independent effects of predictors (sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and presence of chronic conditions) on: i) health research participation, ii) opportunities to participate in health research, and iii) willingness to participate in health research.",
    "However, weighting the survey data to be representative of the state's population should compensate for any potential selection biases in sampling.",
    "\"Ever participated in health research\" and \"Opportunity to participate in health research\" are dichotomous outcomes, thus a multivariable logistic regression was used.",
    "9,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] However, the findings are consistent with a small number of more recent studies that document a willingness to participate among racial and ethnic minorities.",
    "Despite these limitations, this is the largest study of its kind using a representative sample.",
    "As shown in Table 2, no significant associations were found between respondents' areas of residence (rural/urban) and past participation, past opportunity, or willingness to participate in health research.",
    "Multivariable regression models were fitted to confirm associations between the predictors (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics, rurality/urbanity, access to care, perceived general health, general health status, and chronic conditions) and the three outcomes of interest.",
    "Willingness to participate in health research was measured on a nominal scale (\"Yes\"/\"No\"/\"Undecided\"), thus a multinomial logistic regression 21 was conducted with the response \"No\" as the baseline category.",
    "Relative to employed respondents, respondents who were unable to work were almost twice as likely to have participated in research (OR = 1.98; CI = 1.21-3.23).",
    "Therefore, important insights may be gained via oversampling of rural, minority, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in future population-based surveys.",
    "The study relied on self-reported responses and, therefore, is subject to response bias.",
    "For unadjusted associations, each of the sociodemographic, rurality/urbanity, access to health care, perceived general health, and chronic conditions variables were cross-tabulated with each of the three dependent variables.",
    "5,[22][23][24][25][26] This unexpected finding could be influenced by the extensive community-based participatory research capacity that the states only academic medical center (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) had invested in to better engage rural and minority participants.",
    "Therefore, it is imperative to understand factors related to diverse populations' research participation, willingness to participate, and opportunities to participate as a first step to developing strategies to facilitate their participation in health research.",
    "\"; and iii) \"Would you take part in a health research study if you had the opportunity?\"",
    "Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, race/ ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, and federal poverty level (FPL) ( Table 1).",
    "Among White respondents, 41.7% reported being willing to take part in health research if given the opportunity.",
    "This was somewhat surprising, as prior research has shown that those with chronic conditions are more likely to participate.",
    "Relative to White respondents, greater proportions of Black and Hispanic respondents who had never participated in research were willing to participate in health research (58.9% and 58.2%, respectively).",
    "Compared with respondents who were married/living together, those who were divorced/separated or widowed were less likely to have participated in health research (OR = 0.59; CI = 0.38-0.93; and OR = 0.55; CI = 0.34-0.90, respectively).",
    "This article used three questions added to the Arkansas BRFSS to examine the relationship between key demographic and health status factors and health research participation, opportunities to participate in health research, and willingness to participate in health research.",
    "[37][38][39] Specifically, the paradoxical findings of this study, which showed no difference in the participation rates of racial/ethnic minorities, yet also showed racial/ethnic minorities report both more opportunity and more willingness, needs further exploration.",
    "Consistent with prior literature, as education increased, so did rates of participation, opportunity, and willingness.",
    "In fact, racial/ethnic minority participants (Black or Hispanic) were more likely to express their willingness to participate in health research if provided the opportunity than White respondents.",
    "* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001.",
    "9 For African Americans and Pacific Islanders, one consistent issue hampering research participation has been distrust and perceived discrimination, owing to a history of research abuse.",
    "With respect to opportunity to participate in health research, we found that respondents aged 25-34 and 35-44 were less likely to have had an opportunity relative to respondents aged 65 years or older (OR = 0.18; CI = 0.08-0.50; and OR = 0.46; CI = 0.23-0.95, respectively).",
    "This study is strengthened by the large representative sample of respondents in Arkansas who took part in the 2015 BRFSS.",
    "Those who reported a time in the year when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost (55.0%), were more likely to be willing to participate in health research."
