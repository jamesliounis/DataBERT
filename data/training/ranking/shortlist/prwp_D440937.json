  "shortlist": [
    "See for exampleCalvo, Leiderman and Reinhart (1993),and Fernandez-Arias and Montiel (1995.",
    "These are the main questions we attempt to answer in this paper.",
    "SeeKaminsky and Reinhart (1996)",
    "The results are presented in Table 8.",
    "We also take into account the time series properties of the variables in the regression, as proposed by Siklos(1996) .",
    "14 Augmnented Dickey Fuller tests indicated that MP, NFA, LEPPI and LRGDPSA were nonstationary, moreover, cointegration tests (allowing for deterministic interventionist dummies to account for possible structural breaks) resulted in a plausible cointegrating relationship among the I(1) variables.",
    "The results, together with the list of instruments, are in Table 9 .",
    "A more formal analysis of the interactions of fiscal policy and other key variables is undertaken by Agenor, McDermott, and Ucer (1997) which confirms the above analysis.",
    "The results are in Table 11 .",
    "See Cumby and Obstfeld (1983) for a thorough derivation of the measure.",
    "As shown by Atiyas et.al (1998) , consolidating these into public sector accounts and netting out intra-governmental debt change the primary balance situation significantly.",
    "al (1992 and Atiyas and Ersel (1994) .",
    "Preliminary data suggest that the appreciation of the currency in real terms in the first half of the 1998 was around 8-10%.",
    "Here, we follow the methodology of Cumby and Obstfeld (1983) to estimate the Central Bank sterilization reaction function, with consideration of the endogeneity problems.",
    "Error correction versions of the estimation are summarized in Table 13 .",
    "In doing so, we follow the approach of Kamin and Wood (1997) applied to the case of Mexico, and a cross section of other Pacific Basin countries.",
    "Table 6 shows the decomposition of the flows until 1997  in millions of US$, whereas Table 7 shows the decomposition as percentages of the Capital Account, inclusive of net errors and omissions.",
    "-40 - for 1981 -1989 , Atiyas and Ersel (1994 ; for 1990-1997, own calculation based on Central Bank data.",
    "The recent literature on capital flows to developing countries has shown that capital inflows are associated with the appreciation of the real exchange6.",
    "This observation calls into question the usefulness of the distinction between short-term and long-term flows.",
    "We estimate this equation for private and public consumption separately, using quarterly data for the period 1987-96.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized in three main parts.",
    "Therefore, estimation was carried out using two stage least squares, for the period 1990:02 to 1996:06.",
    "This long run cointegrating relationship is included in our first differences specification as the error correction term, EC.",
    "Estimation was done for total, portfolio and short term capital flows, using monthly data for 1990-1997 as well as foreign direct investment using quarterly data for the period 1990-19973.",
    "The results of the basic equation estimation for private fixed capital formation are in the first two columns of Table 12 .",
    "The Treasury data show larger foreign liabilities of the banks than Central Bank data.",
    "Note: Instrumental variables used were: a constant, monthly dummies, three lags of the dependent and conditioning variables, 6 lags of NFA, uncovered interest parity and three lags of it.",
    "-38 - As our analysis in the preceding sections suggest, Turkey's banks operate in one of the world's most volatile macroeconomic environrnents.",
    "Celasun and Tansel (1993) show that there has been a strong link between real interest rates and private saving, which indicates that private savings will come at a high cost.",
    "Note: **: Significant at 5 %, * :Significant at 10 % .",
    "The first column in Table 3 shows the estimated coefficients when the equation excludes real M2.",
    "Therefore there could be substantial amount of short-term flows which were captured by the official statistics on \"short-term\" capital inflows.",
    "The sterilization coefficient is a statistically significant -0.37.",
    "The results are shown in the last two columns of Table 10 .",
    "As we indicated in the opening of the paper, since Turkey opened up its economy through a series of reforms in the 1 980s, establishing fiscal discipline has been a key policy challenge.",
    "Since capital flows are assumed to affect real variables indirectly through their effect on interest rates and the availability of credit, the inclusion of these variables in the regression would be expected to reduce the coefficient on capital flows.",
    "The estimation method used was maximum likelihood allowing for an AR(1) error structure.",
    "Data of the maturity structure of foreign liabilities are hard to come by, but according to BIS, of the US$29.2 billion total claims on Turkey at the end of 1997 by BIS-reporting international banks, 56.3% were claims of maturity up to and including one year.",
    "The results for fixed capital formation by the public sector, as shown in the last two columns of Table 11 are not different.",
    "An important issue that needs to be mentioned here is the measurement of public sector deficits.",
    "Though the ratio does not look particularly high as compared to a number of other large capital importer countries, whether the reserves are all freely usable is an issue of concern in the case of Turkey.",
    "Source: BIS, The Maturity, Sectoral and Nationality Distribution of Intemational Bank Lending, various issues.",
    "An analysis of economic management during the 1989-1997 period in general and the post 1994 crisis period in particular is also called for, in order to draw policy lessons and to offer some thoughts for a possible stabilization program.",
    "We will then present econometric evidence on the determinants of various components of the capital account.",
    "Since inflows were particularly strong in 1995-1997, the extent of reserve accumulation has been substantial, as seen in Table 6 .",
    "Thus reserves must be compared with a broad measure of liquid monetary assets in order to determine a country's vulnerability to panic.",
    "As our analysis of the decomposition of capital flows in section II.2 showed, the C'entral Bank's accumulation of reserves over the 1995-1997 period was quite large, which was consistent with its constant real exchange rate policy.",
    "We estimated error correction versions of the equations as well, and finally estimated a parsimonious version of the equations, removing insignificant explanatory variables.",
    "The insignificance of the growth of real GDP variable stands in contrast to some other country studies (see for example Corbo and Desormeaux 1996) and seems to be suggestive of the fact that, the most important pull factor of capital flows is the short run interest rate differential rather than growth opportunities in the economy."
