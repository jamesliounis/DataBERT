    "24 See Fay et al (2011) for a detailed discussion.",
    "SeeRamey (2011) andParker (2011) for an insightful and comprehensive discussion.16 In general, studies using physical indicators of infrastructure stocks find a positive long-run effect of infrastructure on output, productivity, and growth rates, whereas results are more mixed among studies using measures of public capital stock or infrastructure spending flows(Straub 2008, Calder\u00f3n andServ\u00e9n 2010).",
    "compressors, which have to be imported (Pauschert 2009) .",

    "As can be seen in Table 2 , low-income countries import more power generatingequipment from China than from the United States.",
    "Data on temporary, deficit-financed increases of government purchases in the U.S. yields estimates of multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 (Ramey 2011).",

    "Taking the state of the economy into account can lead to very different results (Parker 2011) .",
    "Using a meta-analysis based on 49 studies on OECD countries, Ligthart and Martin Suarez (2011) report an output elasticity of public capital of 0.14.",
    "Of course, these calculations are based on simple correlations.",
    "Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2010) use a nonlinear VAR structure, which allows the estimation of multipliers that differ in recession and in expansion.",
    "Reliable data on tax-financed spending however is very limited, to some extent reflecting the fact that a significant share of infrastructure spending is moved off-budget.",
    "The World Bank's Global Monitoring Report (2009a) notes that, -A pattern is beginning to emerge of increases in import licensing, import tariffs and surcharges, and trade remedies to support industries facing difficulties early on in the crisis.\u2016 Luckily, contrary to the Great Depression of the 1930s, the 2008-09 recession has not triggered a negative spiral of -beggar-thy-neighbor\u2016 policies.",
    "26 In 2009, about 70 percent of traded capital goods from low-income countries were sourced from high-income countries (see Table 1 ).",
    "Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori (2011) find that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation reduces real private consumption over the next two years by 0.75 percent, while real GDP declines by 0.62 percent.",
    "Not surprisingly, identifying the right projects often requires significant resources aimed at project selection and preparation.",
    "Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) , for example, show that the government spending multiplier can be in excess of three when the interest rate is held constant, such as at a zero lower bound in a model with sticky prices.",
    "This holds particularly true for firms in sectors that are not electricity-intensive and that face significant power outages(Alby, Dethier, and Straub 2011).20 Infrastructure in the context of this paper refers to various types of hard infrastructure, such as highways, telecommunications networks, port facilities, and power supplies.",
    "The authors reach the conclusion that credible hard budget constraints on service providers, a comprehensive regulatory framework, and independent regulatory and supervisory bodies are important to contain the fiscal risks associated with PPPs.",
    "The length reached 74,100 km by 2010 (National Statistical Bureau 2011).",
    "In Africa, for example, regional power trading could reduce energy costs by US$2 billion and carbon emissions by 70 million tons annually (Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia 2010) .",
    "As a result, firms in Mozambique, Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal, the Gambia, Madagascar, and Niger spend more than 10 percent of their total costs on energy, whereas in China, the cost of energy is only 3 percent of total costs.",
    "There exists also some empirical evidence that returns of infrastructure investments in advanced countries tend to be particularly high if these investments complete a network that is already sufficiently developed.",
    "Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia (2010) argue that -each dollar raised spent by a Sub-Saharan African government has a marginal cost of public funds of almost 20 percent\u2016.",
    "Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2010) estimate the multiplier effects of different types of government spending during the New Deal and find that public works had the highest multiplier equal to 1.7.",
    "12 For Brazil,Ferreira and Araujo (2008) find that a debt financed increase in the infrastructure stock of 1 percent of GDP in one year would have effectively paid for itself through tax revenues after 20 years.",
    "At the same time, the cost of PPPs can be significantly higher than under pure public provision (Engel, Fischer, Galetovic 2010) .",
    "The combination of excess capacity, low returns on investment, high risks and lower growth in advanced economies has been referred to as the -new normal.\u2016 3 If this -new normal\u2016 becomes entrenched, several advanced countries may face a lost decade 4 -with negative consequences for the entire world.",
    "9 The OECD (2006) estimates that global annual investment in telecommunications, land transport, water, and electricity will average 3.5 percent of GDP or approximately US$2 trillion in 2009 prices for OECD countries.",
    "Third, there is strong empirical evidence that infrastructure investment in developing countries has a large and positive effect on growth and tends to be higher for countries with a lower level of income.",
    "Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2010b) cite the example of Colombia where government guarantees led to fiscal costs that were 50 percent higher than the investment supplied by the private sector.",

    "They find in general an elasticity of output with respect to public capital in the order of 0.1 to 0.2.",
    "They find that the cumulative impact of multipliers over five years is higher during the recession, ranging from 1 to 1.5 (versus 0 to 0.5 during boom periods).",
    "Estimates from different types of power plants in India indicate that more than 60 percent and sometimes up to 90 percent of the cost estimates of turn-key power plants and substations are related to a few key mechanical devices, such as turbines and 27 The National Export Initiative (NEI) was created on March 11, 2010, by Executive Order.",
