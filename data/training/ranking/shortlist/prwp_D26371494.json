    "This paper proceeds as follows.",
    "Field data for the 2012 group, the reference year of the panel, were collected between March and July 2012.",
    "The 2012 data comprised the baseline round of the survey.",
    "Data were compiled between November 8, 2010 and March 7, 2011.",
    "Statistics presented in this paper may be different than those in the reports for the various surveys because of differences in the universe (children versus mothers or households) or other elements of data treatment.",
    "In discussing the data, we first describe the surveys used to measure ECD and then how we measure ECD and circumstances.",
    "The paper relies on four different surveys conducted in Morocco: \uf0b7 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 2003/04 \uf0b7 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) of 2006/07 \uf0b7 National Population and Family Health Survey (ENPSF) of 2011 \uf0b7 National Human Development Observatory (ONDH) panel baseline round of 2012 8 All these surveys are relatively similar in nature.",
    "Two questionnaires-designed and adapted based on the PAPFAM model questionnaires-were used to compile data; one household questionnaire and one individual questionnaire targeting ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 from the households surveyed.",
    "The resulting data are nationally representative after the application of sample weights.",
    "Data were compiled between October 30, 2006 and December 30, 2006.",
    "The 2006 MICS compiled data on children using modules from the MICS3 questionnaire as well as data on young people from the questionnaire used for the PAPFAM.",
    "Table 2 , in the annex, presents the full set of relationships between nutrition and children's background.",
    "The D-index is derived by comparing group means for different combinations of circumstances to the population mean to quantify how outcomes differ by circumstances.",
    "These indicators were selected due to their important contributions to ECD while keeping in mind the limitations of the data.",
    "Here too, available data do not allow for comparisons over time, given that the outcomes are from a single survey.",
    "To ensure that the outcomes of the various surveys used are comparable and to compensate for the finite sample size of a number of surveys, we grouped the data retaining the old breakdown into seven regions based on the distribution of the sample from each survey, in accordance with the different regions in the country.",
    "A recent metaanalysis synthesizing the findings from 24 studies in 15 countries found that Sesame Street productions are a scalable and effective intervention (Mares & Pan, 2013) .",
    "As this paper corroborates and other research has found (Vollmer, Harttgen, Subramanyam, et al., 2014) , ECD does not necessarily improve simply because of economic growth.",
    "Table 1 (in annex 1) shows health outcomes over time and their relationship with different circumstances.",
    "However, once again, we lack the data to examine trends among this proportion of children over time.",
    "19 When data on parents' education was not available (parents were not identified clearly in all of the surveys), the highest education level of the adult females in the household was used for mother's education, and the highest education level of adult males in the household was used for father's education.",
    "The descriptive analyses of the state of ECD for each indicator are based on the mean value of an outcome for a population, specifically the average share or percentage experiencing that outcome.",
    "This process generates an exact, additive decomposition of the D-index into the contributions of different individual circumstances or groups of circumstances (Shorrocks, 2013) .",
    "Section 4 presents our findings in terms of ECD trends, risk factors, inequality, and the drivers of inequality.",
    "Data, Information, and Monitoring One substantial challenge to improving the state of ECD in Morocco and reducing inequality is the lack of data available on ECD.",
    "Finally, there is a challenge in effectively scaling up good models (Bouguen, Filmer, Macours, & Naudeau, 2013) .",
    "We estimate the D-index based on the logit model discussed in the regression analyses section.",
    "While the contributions of different background characteristics vary over time and across the measures of ECD, a number of consistent patterns stand out.",
    "Section 2 discusses the data we use to measure ECD and inequality over time in Morocco.",
    "Available survey data do not allow for measurement of changes in child access to iodized salt over time, because the 2006/2007 MICS survey is the only one that contains the relevant information.",
    "For our analysis, we have used wealth quintiles based on an asset index that can be calculated for all the surveys that we have used.",
    "This index is defined based on factor analysis (Filmer & Pritchett, 2001 ) using indicator variables to determine whether or not the household owns certain goods such as a car, a refrigerator, or a television, and facilitates the classification of households into quintiles, from the poorest to the richest.",
    "To assess the state of ECD, we first undertake descriptive analyses of the level of ECD outcomes in Morocco over time and differences by subgroups.",
    "This work assessed a number of different measures of ECD, but many were available only once or twice within a decade.",
    "Initially, a sample size of 8,094 households was planned to ensure representativeness across the country in each area of residence (urban, rural) and even at the level of certain regions.",
    "20 The are population shares or sampling weights (de Barros, Ferreira, Vega, & Chanduvi, 2009) .",
    "These simulations are based on the regression analyses.",
    "Morocco has made some progress in collecting information about ECD, for instance, adding questions about development activities to the ENPSF, but much more comprehensive and frequent national survey data would help identify progress and challenges.",
    "Anthropometric data were also collected directly through measurement of children.",
    "This section assesses how inequality has been evolving over time in Morocco; the tables underlying the quantification of inequality (dissimilarity index) and the different factors that contribute to inequality (Shapley decomposition) are presented in the annex (Table 4 and Table  5 ).",
    "Underlying the calculation of the dissimilarity index and the calculation of the least advantaged/most advantaged simulations are regression analyses.",
    "Regression analyses are used to estimate how a particular circumstance-for instance, mother's education-is related to an outcome while taking account of other characteristics such as household wealth.",
    "It should be noted that for the D-index calculations (but not elsewhere) we reverse our coding of some variables so that we are assessing inequality in the optimal outcome (thus, not dying in the first year of life, rather than dying in the first year of life, and so on), to maintain comparability across both negative and positive outcomes.21 We implement the D-index in STATA using the module hoi(Azevedo, Franco, Rubiano, & Hoyos, 2010).",
    "The Shapley decompositions (Table 5) show the relative contributions of different circumstances (wealth, mother's education, father's education, region, urban versus rural, and gender) to this inequality, as a percentage.",
    "Sample weights are used throughout all the analyses to make statistics nationally representative.",
    "Essentially, the probability of an outcome, for instance, attending ECCE, is predicted based on the coefficients from the logit regression and the circumstances of the profile (least or most advantaged).",
    "models underlie both these measures and allow for Shapley decompositions of the factors contributing to the inequality measured by the dissimilarity index.",
    "Long duration did not necessarily produce better results (Engle, Fernald, Alderman, et al., 2011) .",
    "Section 3 describes the methods we use to assess ECD, quantify inequality, and decompose its origins.",
    "The DHS of Morocco for 2003/04 was conducted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with the Measure DHS program, ORC Macro, and the Pan Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM)."
