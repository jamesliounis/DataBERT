    "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
    "Table V.1 shows that an important part of the increase in imports from Mercosur occurred after the application of the DIEMs on products from the rest of the world, whereas until 1993 when Mercosur was still in the formative stage, the evolution was very similar between both trade flows.",
    "The comparative GDP data clearly shows that the footwear industry was affected disproportionately in relation to the manufacturing sector as a whole\" (WTO 1999 para.",
    "Supporting this view, de Paiva Abreu (1996 page 66) asserts that while the average tariff reduction implemented by developed countries on industrial products was 28%, the reduction for footwear imports was only 6.1% i.e., the lowest among the sample of industries included in this study.",
    "This section is based on Section II of our paper(Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat, 2005) on the historical experience of Argentina with antidumping and safeguard measures.3 For some industries including footwear as we shall see, the tariff dismantling program was extended until the end of 1998(ALADI 2002).",

    "Table II .1 provides information on ad-valorem tariff rates as well as the fraction of tariff lines covered with import licenses.",
    "And other questions alike\" (page 277).",
    "Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat (2005) review this experience and conclude that over time overvaluation increased the likelihood of arriving at positive injury determinations.8 According toShetty (1995), by the mid 1980s, Taiwan and Korea represented 45% of world footwear exports but by 1994 their share had decreased to 7%.",

    "In The central problems to solve were: a) to prove an import growth that could be considered unforeseen, recent, unexpected, serious and important, both quantitatively and qualitatively; b) to eliminate imports from Mercosur; and c) under the new evidence, to prove serious injury and causality.",
    "The process that was triggered by the trade liberalization program is presented in Graph III.1, which shows total imports of footwear and footwear parts.",
    "There are three aspects of the case that are important to consider in the context of this paper: i) the economic and political problem underlying the dispute, ii) the determinations of the Special Group and the Appellate Body and, iii) the impact on and the response by Argentina.",
    "Figure II .2 shows that imports increased from less than $5 billion dollars in the late 1980\u00b4s and early 1990\u00b4s, to more than $20 billion dollars in 1994-95, and more than $30 billion dollars in the late 1990\u00b4s.",

    "According to Consejo T\u00e9cnico de Inversiones S.A. (2002), in 2002 the following companies launched new projects: Grimoldi, in joint venture with Wolverini, Adidas, Alpargatas in agreement with FILA, Union, and Dexter Shops and Nike in agreement with Gatic.",
    "As Table III .1 shows, competitive pressures on the domestic industry heightened 16 as imports grew to 8.9 million pairs in 1991, 16.6 million pairs in 1992, and 21.8 million pairs in 1993 when they represented around one-third of domestic production.",
    "With this argument, the EC disqualified the important increase in imports recorded between 1991 and 1993 (Table III .1).",
    "In referring to the case of developed countries in the Tokyo Round, Hufbauer and Elliot (1994, page 66) expressed that in some footwear categories \"Ad valorem rates \u2026remained dutiable at the Smoot-Hawley rate of 25 to 37.5%.",
    "The figures shown on Table III.1 correspond to the tariff positions for which the CIC requested safeguard measures.",
    "In November, the Appellate Body stated the following: \"The Appellate Body recommends that the DSB request that Argentina bring its safeguard measures found in this Report and in the Panel Report as modified by this Report, to be inconsistent with the Agreement on Safeguards, into conformity with its obligations under that Agreement\".",
    "In what follows we summarize and offer brief comments on the salient issues that provide the background situation in which the safeguard measures were applied, including:",
    "(emphasis added) Therefore, we reverse the Panel's conclusion in paragraph 8.69 of the Panel Report that safeguard measures imposed after entry into force of the WTO Agreement which meet the requirements of the Agreement on Safeguards necessarily \"satisfy\" the requirements of Article XIX of the GATT 1994, as well as the Panel's finding that the Uruguay Round negotiators \"expressly omitted\" the clause -\"as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effect of the obligations incurred by a Member under this Agreement, including tariff concessions \u2026 \" -from Article 2 of the Agreement on Safeguards\" (WTO 1999a, para.",
    "Both the Panel and later the Appellate Body adopted a similar criterion to that of the EC, in the sense of analyzing compliance with the rules without linking the argument to the existence of a program to curb imports, which as said, was undertaken in the context of a far-reaching unilateral liberalization program undertaken before the Uruguay Round agreements were signed.",
    "For example, the national economic census of 1994 shows that in 1993 salaries represented 59.3% of gross value added in leather footwear manufacturing, 58.8% in the case of footwear made of fabric, plastic and other materials, and 57.8% in footwear parts manufacturing.",
    "This trade diversion effects were heightened by the devaluation of the Real in early 1999 which caused regional footwear imports to reach close to 25 million pairs/year (Graph VI.2a) a figure that was higher than those recorded for all years before 1998.",
    "The development of the cold storage industry since the end of the 19th century favored meat exports which in turn, increased the supply of leather, the main raw material of this industry.10 As a comparative reference, it can be pointed out that in 1992, Italy exported 81% of its footwear production, Brazil exported 30% and Argentina exported only 3.5%.11 The CNCE was created in 1994 and assigned the responsibility for the injury investigations in antidumping, subsidy and safeguards investigations.",
    "As Graph III.2 shows, this process became stronger in the 1990s when exports temporarily reached 100 million dollars/year.",
    "In the context of its description of the \"facts and background of the procedure\" before the Special Group \"Argentina -Measures that affect imports of footwear, textiles, apparel and other articles,\" the EC alleged that \"In fact, Argentina was applying a safeguard measure without complying with any of the procedures established in the WTO Agreement applicable as from January 1 st 1995.\"",
    "In the medium to long run, this and other WTO decisions against Argentina's safeguard measures has led the business community to rely more on the antidumping mechanism (Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat 2005) .",
    "Summing up, it is quite clear that the devaluation has been far more successful in reducing imports than any of the contingent protection measures implemented in earlier years.",
    "Export Import Table III .1: Imports of Finished Footwear Source: Authors' elaboration based on the WTO (1999).",
    "Obviously the high employment dependency in these locations which generally were relatively poor areas, increased the political visibility of the petition.",
    "(European Confederation of the Footwear Industry, 1995) The US is the country that is more open to imports, and this has resulted in an almost total migration of manufacturing activities to developing countries (Shetty 1995 , American Apparel & Footwear Association, 2004 and US.",
    "the numbers indicate a strong reduction of the average level during the Convertibility years from 1991until 2002.",
    "pairs 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Mill.",
    "The evidence indicates that the impact of these policies on imports was only a fraction of the effects that the early 2002 devaluation of the peso had (Graphs VI.1a and VI.2a).",
    "In the case of Argentina, another negative consequence of this jurisprudence has been a tendency to shift petitions for import relief to the antidumping mechanism (see Nogu\u00e9s and Baracat, 2005) which in some cases is operating as a substitute safeguard mechanism (see Finger, 2002) .",
    "Likewise, the norm indicated that this measure was temporary and that it was linked to an investment plan for the readjustment and specialization process of the benefited industries 18 .",
    "In turn, the National Economic Census of 1994 shows a total of 27,177 people employed by this industry 12 , whereas the 1985 census showed a total employment of 31,596",
    "In summary, for a few years Argentina used the DIEMs as a unilateral de facto safeguard measure.",
    "Due to the atomization that characterizes the industry, statistics are not as accurate as for other sectors.",
    "Nevertheless for these industries, the turnaround came in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso that lowered imports to a far greater than any of the relief and safeguards measures discussed above (Graphs VI.1 and VI.2).",
    "However, the argument held by Argentina showed that had the DIEMs not been in place, imports from all origins would have risen, as it happened between 1991 and 1993.",
    "The EC objected that Argentina's investigation was based on statistics on total imports, while safeguard measures were applied only on imports from third countries.",
    "The availability of abundant raw material and relatively low wages favored the development of clusters that became highly efficient.",
    "According toCerutti (2003), between 1991 and 2000 the industry invested a total of 541 million dollars, or an annual average of 54 million dollars, a figure equivalent to 5% of the production value and 13% of the value added.",
    "As mentioned before, since late 1993, the DIEMs operated as a de facto Argentina's experience with these measures was certainly discouraging in relation to the use of WTO safeguards.",
    "Summing-up, the determinations by the Appellate Body concluded that Argentina was not able to prove an increase in imports, serious injury and causality."
