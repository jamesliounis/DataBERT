  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 19.0) was used for all statistical analyses.",
    "The demographic and clinical variables of the 302 patients who took part in the study are shown in table 1 .",
    "Based on the ADNI study, Gibbons et al.",
    "The findings are based on a selected group of patients recruited at two university memory clinics and diagnosed with subjective cognitive impairment or MCI based on GDS scores of 2 and 3 [3, 38, 39] .",
    "In the present analysis we included the 4 tests of executive function and memory that were most frequently used at both sites.",
    "First, descriptive statistics for the demographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics of the patient population were computed.",
    "Crosstab statistics was then performed to describe the development of the different MCI categories over a 2-year period.",
    "A significant number of patients in all subgroups showed normal test results at followup, indicating that a neuropsychological diagnosis needs to be supported by imaging or biomarker data.",
    "The cited studies employ different individual measures of executive functions, combine executive and nonexecutive measures, employ different composite measures and different cutoff criteria for impairment and study different age groups, and many include only a small number of participants.",
    "Multivariate regression analysis showed that both multidomain MCI (OR = 22.25, p = 0.001) and amnestic MCI (OR = 5.91, p = 0.001) were significant and strong predictors of dementia at follow-up.",
    "Participants were recruited from the GO-MCI, which is a collaborative longitudinal study of people with MCI.",
    "In a much smaller longitudinal study by Whitwell et al.",
    "As expected, patients scoring poorly at baseline showed a greater tendency toward conversion to dementia, defined as a GDS score of 4 Values denote means \u00b1 SD unless specified otherwise.",
    "Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between multidomain MCI and amnestic MCI, and development of dementia (GDS score \u2265 4) after 2 years ( table 3 ) .",
    "* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. eMCI = Dysexecutive MCI; aMCI = amnestic MCI; mMCI = multidomain MCI; n.s.",
    "Our findings might have been similar to the findings of Nordlund et al.",
    "From the GO-MCI database, we identified MCI patients with amnestic, nonamnestic executive and multidomain impairment at baseline evaluation, based on neuropsychological criteria (see below).",
    "Based on this analysis, independent variables were chosen to be tested in a multivariate logistic model.",
    "To increase the robustness and specificity, as well as the ability to precisely categorize cognitive function in low-risk groups, future studies should also employ more comprehensive neuropsychological assessments [50] than the present study.",
    "Employing neuropsychological criteria, both Bozoki et al.",
    "The included patients were classified by the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) [38, 39] with scores of 2 and 3, as determined by the procedure described above.",
    "All the test results were converted to T scores, a normally distributed scale with a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.",
    "Values denote means \u00b1 SD with maximum ranges in parentheses.",
    "The mean age of the participants was 62.7 years at baseline testing, which Values denote numbers with percentages in parentheses.",
    "The Swedish part of the study was approved by the local ethics committee, and the research at both sites was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration.",
    "Reproduction of the RCFT was scored by the normative data from Meyers and Meyers [42] .",
    "In conclusion, the present study found that executive or amnestic deficits in either their pure form or in combination occur frequently in a relatively young clinical population (mean age: 63 years) referred for cognitive complaints.",
    "Conversion of T scores was based on these normative data.",
    "The TMT-B and the COWAT were scored by the demographic norms by Heaton et al.",
    "The baseline test scores for patients with no MCI compared with the MCI subtypes, based on neuropsychological criteria, are given in table 2 .",
    "In a study on younger MCI patients, Johnson et al.",
    "[33] if we had included a more comprehensive nonamnestic assessment.",
    "The memory clinics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and Akershus University Hospital in Oslo employ the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, similar clinical assessments and similar neuropsychological test batteries.",
    "This is practical, but the robustness of the cognitive findings may suffer as healthy participants may be categorized as cognitively impaired based on single and possibly incidental poor scores.",
    "[33] employed a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in a similar MCI population and found conversion to dementia, within a 2-year time span, only in multidomain amnestic and multidomain nonamnestic patients, and not in any form of single-domain MCI.",
    "The diagnosis of MCI was made in congruence with the most recent recommendations and has been described elsewhere [14, 37] .",
    "However, as 50% of the participants did not show evidence of cognitive impairment -and many also improved -at follow-up, there is indication that the sample consisted of a large number of cognitively healthy persons at low risk of developing dementia in the short time period of the present study.",
    "Possibly the most important reason for this discrepancy is that, in the ADNI study [17] , the mean age was 75 years, and in the study by Whitwell et al.",
    "We created an 'executive index', based on the TMT-B and COWAT, and an 'amnestic index', consisting of RAVLT-delayed recall and RCFT-delayed reproduction.",
    "Then, a series of independent t tests was performed, comparing the single-domain MCI groups as well as the multidomain MCI group with the group showing normal test results (noMCI group).",
    "First, the neuropsychological MCI categories described above were tested in a logistic univariate model.",
    "In 1999 researchers from the Mayo Clinic proposed quantitative criteria for identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a prodromal stage of AD [3] , focusing on the importance of memory impairment.",
    "Several studies have shown that the rate of progression is likely to be more rapid with greater neuropsychological impairment at baseline [6, 7] .",
    "The Gothenburg-Oslo MCI Study (GO-MCI) includes mainly patients in their mid-60s with MCI broadly defined as subjective or objective cognitive impairment.",
    "[6] found that deficits in both memory and psychomotor speed/executive function were a stronger predictor of conversion to AD than pure amnestic MCI after approximately 2 and 4 years, respectively.",
    "This study and many other MCI studies employed relatively short test batteries.",
    "The rate of conversion to dementia after 2 years (GDS score 4 or higher) was analyzed for each of the MCI subtypes.",
    "For inclusion, subjective and objective evidence (verified by an informant) was required for progressive cognitive impairment over a period of more than 6 months.",
    "The results from the study suggest that impairment in multiple cognitive domains is associated with a more severe outcome over 2 years.",
    "[33] found that of the 44 patients (25%) who developed dementia, 35 originated from a multidomain amnestic group and 9 belonged to a multidomain nonamnestic group."
