  "shortlist": [
    "The next section of this paper presents our theoretical framework, develops our general hypotheses, and explains our methods.",
    "All the data on which we rely are systematized and presented in a data Appendix, which is available from the authors.",
    "We summarize our calculations (described more fully in the Appendix available from the authors) in the following table.",
    "Using the results of the Gauri and Brinks investigation, we can identify broad national trends in this regard, with some sub-national variation.",
    "In this paper, we conduct new analyses of the distributive effects of the social and economic rights cases that came out of that five-country survey.",
    "This present paper builds on the data on success rates and overall implementation to analyze the distributional effects of the cases.",
    "In this paper we try to address these two issues.",
    "This theoretical framework has at least one important implication for the literature.",
    "Using data from the government and the World Bank, we estimate that 36.3% of these students were from the lowest two income 27 quintiles (detailed calculations are in the appendix).",
    "Similar calculations for other cases are in Table 6 .",
    "The individual calculations are explained and defended in an appendix to the paper and are available from the authors.",
    "In the next section we summarize the results of our investigation for the five countries included in the Gauri and Brinks study, and then compare these results to our theoretical expectations.",
    "In order to test these ideas, we take the results of the Gauri and Brinks investigationa list of cases for each of the five countries in the areas of health and education, plus an estimate of the number of people directly and indirectly benefited by this litigationand extend the analysis with detailed estimates of the share of benefits going to disadvantaged classes in each of those countries.",
    "Where better data are available, we clarify and correct their estimates.",
    "Classifications of effects into direct and indirect, material and symbolic, and so on, can be found in Rosenberg (1991 ), McCann (1994 , and Rodriguez Garavito (2009), as well as Gauri and Brinks (2008) .",
    "For the countries we have examined, Table 8 shows measures of access to justice (cases per 10 million in the countries in our sample); the win rates of for litigants in health and education rights cases; the extent to which the executive branch usually implements social and economic rights rulings, as observed by the analysts in the Gauri and Brinks volume, and our indicator variable for the breadth of applicability of court rulings.",
    "Da Silva and Terrazas (2011) , for example, find, that, in terms of income, the surveyed population of direct beneficiaries is exactly representative of the overall population of S\u00e3o Paulo.",
    "But much of the qualitative literature on the judicialization of health in Brazil describes how after a significant number of cases for a particular medication, the states stop opposing judicial claims for that medication and begin supplying it routinely (Hoffman and Bentes 2008) , thus producing indirect policy effects.",
    "Table 7 summarizes By this measure, the poor are overrepresented among the beneficiaries of SE litigation, in cases with expected progressive effects, by a factor of around 2 to 1.",
    "Our curiosity was triggered by a book that carried out detailed studies of SE rights enforcement in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and South Africa (Gauri and Brinks 2008) .",
    "Table 2 summarizes the results of our investigation for Brazil's health cases.",
    "The succeeding section applies the framework to the cases and develops expected findings.",
    "The last columns shows our measure of the extent to which the court rulings have a pro-poor impact, taken from the tables above.",
    "Since we rely on their data, and it is already classified under this typology, this is also an efficient way to proceed.",
    "Overall, the table shows that our indicator of the breadth of applicability of court rulings is most closely correlated with the extent to which the poor share in the benefits from these rulings.",
    "Instead, we use the results of surveys and studies of the characteristics of people with a particular illness.",
    "In Brazil, Gauri and Brinks identified over seven thousand cases in the four sampled Brazilian states (Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia, and Goias), the great majority of which involved claims for medications.",
    "While our conclusion sounds like it directly contradicts existing empirical findings (e.g., Ferraz 2011; Da Silva & Terrazas, 2011) , this is partly because we focus on indirect beneficiaries, while they look at the characteristics of individual litigants.",
    "We now know that there are many more, especially in the years since that study (see, e.g., Ferraz 2011, conservatively estimating 40,000 cases per year), but for our purposes the number of litigants is less important than the number of expected beneficiaries, and their distribution across social strata.",
    "Chicago and London, University of Chicago Press..",
    "While much of the literature is concerned with Provision cases (Bergallo 2005; Ferraz 2011 ; Yamin and Gloppen 2011), Gauri and Brinks show that, with the exception of Brazil, legal petitions requesting direct state provision of a particular good form the minority of social and economic rights cases in every country in their study.",
    "With this information it was possible to calculate the number of SE cases reaching courts; the likelihood that plaintiffs succeed; and, on the basis of interviews of judges, advocates, and others involved in the cases, as well as a review of the secondary literature, the level of implementation.",
    "The table shows that the share of disadvantaged beneficiaries in India is about 83%, consistent with the expectations when the legal system permits abstract policy review and cases focus on regulation.",
    "To put this in the same terms as we used for Brazil we would have to calculate the distribution of, for example, HIV/AIDS patients by income decile.",
    "The aggregation of thousands of individual medications cases, as in Brazil, Colombia or Costa Rica, can ultimately have a large effect, but in order to get thousands of cases it is necessary to radically democratize access to the courts (see, e.g., Wilson 2009) , thus extending the potential benefits further down the socio-economic gradient.",
    "That book offered the first systematic cross-national survey of SE rights litigation, including descriptions of the cases filed in each country, estimates of the numbers of people benefiting from constitutional health and education rights cases in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and South Africa, and preliminary analyses of the extent to which giving courts a more prominent role in economic and social policy-making on the basis of social and economic rights in fact benefited disadvantaged individuals and groups.",
    "WHO data show that 47% of diagnosed asthma suffers in India come from the lowest two income quintiles, 9 so that the number of disadvantaged beneficiaries is 551,481 x 47% = 259,196 people.",
    "The survey sought to unearth a complete or representative sample of cases in each country involving the right to health and health care, and the right to education.",
    "We have not done so here, as the data challenges for such an undertaking would be daunting to say the least.",
    "If we simply examined the characteristics of direct beneficiaries, we would likely conclude, as does the existing literature on this topic, that they do not over-represent the poor.",
    "The concluding section examines what our findings mean for the conventional wisdom, and offers some perspective on the broader normative questions raised by the judicialization of policy.",
    "Even in the cases we expected to be more regressive (the shaded cells in the table), the situation is not altogether dire.",
    "We know that the vast majority of SUS users have low incomes: Ribeiro et al (2006) For high cost treatments, however, we assume that the SE profile of SUS users of these treatments roughly reflects the social distribution of these diseases in society.",
    "We therefore used secondary evidence to identify the main illnesses suffered by litigants in these cases, and calculated the socio-economic profile of the overall population affected by this illness to estimate the characteristics of potential indirect beneficiaries in order to determine whether litigation was in fact drawing the state's attention to",
    "Following Rodriguez Garavito, Gauri and Brinks, and McCann, therefore, we look for both direct and indirect effects.",
    "The areas where it is easiest to measure the distributive effect of litigationdirect effects on litigants, especially in individual casesand thus where much of the literature has focused, are the areas where effects are most likely regressive and least important in the overall public policy context.",
    "In order to examine the consequences of this impact, we identify the areas in which the results of judicial decisions generalized to broader populations, and we determine as best we can the socio-economic composition and size of the beneficiary class.",
    "But this is just one study, with a fairly narrow empirical base, and we do not have sufficient information to extend it further.",
    "Finally, it is worth returning to some of the existing hypotheses regarding the sources of the (supposed) anti-poor bias of courts, which we alluded to at the outset.",
    "Gauri and Brinks also identify mechanisms for generalizing the effects of Brazilian litigation, however, so we do not expect the benefits to be strictly limited to the -litigating class.\u2016 Still, the cases are largely expected by litigants to have purely individual effects, and thus should focus on more expensive goods and be less pro-poor."
