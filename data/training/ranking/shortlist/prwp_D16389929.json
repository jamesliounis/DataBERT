    "SeeDellaVigna (2009) andBryan, Karlan and Nelson (2010) for recent reviews of empirical applications.",
    "Notes: Data are from baseline sample (for details, see Table 1 ).",
    "See, e.g., Platteau, 2000; Maranz, 2001; Anderson and Baland 2002; Ligon, Thomas, and Worall, 2002; Hoff and Sen, 2006;Baland, Guirkinger and Mali, 2011; Jakiela and Ozier, 2011.",
    "In Appendix Table 4 we present results of an exercise intended to bound the size of this possible bias, running regressions analogous to that of column 6, Table 6 but where observations that were previously not included due to attrition are now included, and where we make several different assumptions as to the value of the dependent variable for the newly-included observations.",
    "The next section presents details of the experimental design, the sample of participants and the setting of the experiment.",
    "Data from columns (2) come from simulations described in Appendix B.",
    "An important question is whether the key results (in Table 6 ) on the impact of days to first disbursement on revisions could be driven entirely by selection, since both these variables are statistically significantly related to revisit success.",
    "Table 1 provides some summary statistics of baseline survey responses.",
    "See, e.g., Thaler, (1981 ) Loewenstein (1987 and Benzion et al.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "Baseline dataset (Panel A) composed of wife-husband pairs interviewed separately in Jan-Feb 2010.",
    "In Table 9 we explore whether estimated effects differ across males and females in the sample, estimating regressions analogous to column 6, Table 6 , but where the sample is restricted to females (column 1) and males (column 2).",
    "See the discussion in Appendix B for further details.",
    "The previous commitment savings experiment is described inBrune, Gin\u00e9, Goldberg, and Yang (2011).19 SeeChoi et al.",
    "To investigate these issues, we implemented a lab-in-the-field experiment that takes revision of a previous decision as the key dependent variable of interest.",
    "Revisit dataset (Panel B) constructed by first randomly choosing 2/3 of households surveyed at baseline and then randomly choosing either husband or wife within household.",
    "Notes: Both baseline and revisit datasets are at individual level.",
    "Table 6 presents the results of ordinary-least squares regressions relating revision behavior to variables capturing all these potential determinants as well as baseline characteristics.",
    "Table 5 presents the results of regressions that relate a participant's tendency to be consistent or \"present\"-biased to observable characteristics.",
    "(2006) lends some support to this conjecture.",
    "In Panel A, each column presents results from regression of given dependent variable on indicator for days to first disbursement (targeted) <=6 and a constant.",
    "Second, as we explain in more detail below, we use the results from the random choice model to justify the construction of certain variables used in the analysis of Table 6 .",
    "A subset of 661 respondents (randomly selected from the full set of baseline respondents in a manner described in section 2.4 below) make up the stage two sample to be revisited.",
    "We attempted to revisit 722 individuals with complete baseline data.",
    "48 At the top of each column is our assumption regarding revision on the part of attrited observations.",
    "(See Appendix A for details.)",
    "In sum, the patterns in the first 6 columns of Table 6 provide support for a model of hyperbolic discounting as an account of some respondents' behavior.",
    "(2008),Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) and Noor (2011), who note that proper inference about time discounting requires information about the curvature of the utility function.8 The correlation between test scores, cognitive load and short-term patience inBenjamin et al.",
    "We chose an indicator of six days or less, which captures a third of the revisited sample, in order to balance concerns about power (which might argue for a specification that is linear in the targeted lag) against the prediction of a non-linear relationship between targeted lag and revision that comes from a model of hyperbolic time discounting.",
    "The paper makes two contributions.",
    "Table 7 presents a summary of magnitudes of these key relationships, using the coefficients from",
    "See Table 6 for other notes.",
    "More precisely, Table 3 describes the distribution of allocations to the later period, in kwacha.",
    "We will return to investigate the correlates of this heterogeneity below.",
    "Our findings should therefore be tested for robustness using similar research designs in other time periods and contexts.",
    "Hausman (1979) , Lawrance (1991) and Warner and Pleeter (2001) are prominent examples.",
    "For comparison purposes, column 2 of Table 2 reports the simulated distribution of consistent choices if participants were to choose consumption randomly.",
    "In this section we first describe the results from stage one of the experiment, and we define key variables from the choices made under commitment used in the analysis of revision behavior in stage two.",
    "For differential selection on this variable to fully explain the coefficient in column 6, Table 6 , revision towards sooner of individuals selecting out of the sample due to having days to first disbursement less than or equal to six would have to have been lower by 1,117.67 MK.",
    "Table 4 shows the results of a regression of the difference between the natural log of the allocation to sooner and later on the rate of return r and observable characteristics of the participants.",
    "Notes: Unit of observation is individual included in revisit sample.",
    "Column 3 of Table 5 indicates that these variables have similar relationships (with opposite signs) with fraction present-biased, though these relationships are not statistically significant.",
    "Appendix Table 3 reports the results.",
    "Figure 4 presents a histogram of changes in the participants' allocations to sooner (t=61) upon revisiting, excluding those who made no change (who represent 35% of observations), and illustrates the frequency of relatively large revisions.",
    "This is, for example, the measure of present-bias inAshraf et al.",
    "Much of the seemingly puzzling evidence regarding intertemporal choices of the poor, and several explanations for it, are nicely summarized in Banerjee and Duflo (2011).2 Ashraf et al (2006), Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson (2011), Dupas and Robinson (2011),Brune et al (2011).",
    ", where \uf062 is the coefficient on days to first disbursement less than or equal to six in the table (124.57),\uf020\uf061 is the revisit success rate for type 1 individuals (0.861), \uf067 is the reduction in the revisit success rate due to revisiting 6 or fewer days to first disbursement (0.108), and \uf06d 1 is the mean revision for type 1 individuals (mean revision for those with days to first disbursement <=6, 150.0).",
    "But coefficient magnitudes are similar to those in the gender-pooled sample of column 6, Table 6 .",
    "The summary statistics bear this out.",
    "Owing to smaller sample sizes, some coefficients do not achieve conventional statistical significance levels, such as those on fraction present-biased (for both genders) and on the days to first disbursement indicator (for females)."
