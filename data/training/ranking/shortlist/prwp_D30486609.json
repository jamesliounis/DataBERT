    "Table A .1 in the appendix provides a summary of studies discussed in this Section.",
    "The structure of this paper is as follows.",
    "These observations are summarized below:",
    "We obtain the PTA data from the WTO RTA database and the World Bank PTA data, which provide contents and enforcement dates of PTAs across countries.",
    "The results are reported in Table 12 and Figure 17 .",
    "Section 3 discusses the data sources and the patterns emerging from the data.",
    "The above finding is summarized below:",
    "In this paper, we first document and compare the historical patterns of FDI around the world including BRI and non-BRI countries and investigate how different types of transportation cost and infrastructure have affected FDI.",
    "In fact, the extent of gravity in FDI is comparable to the extent of gravity in trade that has been found in the literature (see, for example, Head and Mayer, 2013) .",
    "In Figure 2 , we take a look at the spatial distribution of FDI flows in 2001 and 2012, respectively, using data from the UNCTAD FDI Statistics.",
    "At the macro level, numerous studies, including, for example, the work by Borensztein et al.",
    "(2001) and Yeaple (2003) .",
    "In this section, we describe the main data sources of FDI and related economic characteristics and an array of stylized facts emerging from the data.",
    "Using sectoral FDI data, Blonigen et al.",
    "In this analysis, we follow the identification strategy employed in Autor et al.",
    "(2017) show that distance, the level of development of the host country, and institutions are important mediating factors using panel data for 62 countries from 2005 to 2012.",
    "The work byHelpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) is extended in numerous studies including, for example,Yeaple (2009) andChen and Moore (2010).",
    "The literature presented here is based primarily on analysis of historical FDI data in OBOR countries prior to the OBOR initiative.",
    "Wang et al (2016) use firm-level data from Zhejiang Province to examine the impact of financial constraints on firms' ODI decisions and suggest that lowering a firm's financial constraints can increase both the probability and volume of ODI.",
    "Specifically, she uses U.S. trade and affiliate sales data from the 1989 BEA Benchmark Survey of U.S.",
    "Finally, we obtain data on several key country-level economic variables for evaluating the impacts of FDI, including, for example, productivity, employment, wages, and exports.",
    "From 2014 to June 2017, data from CGIT show a total of $170.11 billion investment in construction projects and $99.87 billion investment to BRI countries.",
    "Sources for these variables include Conference Board's Total Economy database, International Labor Organization's ILOSTAT database, and World Development Indicators.",
    "Therefore, for each source-host pair, we construct a pair-year specific \"railway index (OxD)\" as the product of the logged host railway index and the logged source railway index.",
    "Specifically, he uses U.S. affiliate sales data in 39 countries and 50 manufacturing industries from the BEA Benchmark Survey of 1994 and finds that U.S. multinational firms from unskilledlabor intensive industries tend to invest in unskilled-labor abundant countries, a result consistent with the hypothesis that countries' factor endowment differences lead to vertical FDI.",
    "Specifically, we consider the following specification:",
    "Second, some of the instruments that have been considered in recent literature such as Alfaro and Chen (2018) explore supply-side variations across multinational firms and require detailed firm-level operation and investment data that are usually unavailable across a wide range of countries.",
    "Another study by Javorcik and Spatareanu (2008) finds that ownership structure can also be a mediating factor.",
    "Looking at historical data, what have been the roles of various types of transportation cost, infrastructure, and institutional factors in determining the volume and patterns of FDI in BRI countries?",
    "Javorcik and Li (2013) use data from Romania in 1997 -2005 and find that an expansion of global retail chains leads to significant TFP increase in the supplying manufacturing sector.",
    "We thank Jim Feyrer for kindly sharing the data.11 In a related project,Baniya et al.",
    "Table 9 shows that most of the empirical regularities established in previous studies hold in our broad cross-country data.",
    "A study by Farole and Winkler (2014) , using World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, shows three types of mediating factors: firms' absorptive capacity, investors' spillover potential measured by the share of FDI output sold domestically, and host-country institutional factors.",
    "On domestic investment, Wang (2010) uses data from 50 countries over 1970 to 2004 and finds that FDI had a negative contemporaneous effect on domestic investment but a positive cumulative effect on domestic investment.",
    "Tables 18 and 19 report the estimation results using the travel time and ad valorem measures, respectively.",
    "In this paper, we evaluate the patterns, determinants and effects of FDI in BRI countries and the potential impacts of BRI on member countries' FDI and economic growth through reductions of transportation costs.",
    "Table 14 reports the regional comparison.",
    "Brainard (1997) , one of the first empirical studies examining the proximity-concentration trade-off, finds that the patterns in which country characteristics relate to U.S. FDI are broadly in alignment with the market access motive.",
    "In this paper, we examine the patterns and economic effects of foreign direct investment across BRI countries in comparison to other nations and assess the potential role of BRI, by improving countries' physical connectivity and infrastructure, in shaping these patterns and effects.",
    "where subscripts i and j index host and parent countries, respectively, and the subscript t indexes year, BilateralFDI is the bilateral FDI flow from country i to country j, MktSize a vector of GDP of the host and source countries, HCdiff measures the host and source countries' difference in human capital, Transport is a vector of transportation cost measures between country i and country j including air distance, sea distance, driving distance and driving time, Infrastructure is a vector of indices that measure the quality of trade-related logistic infrastructure including railway, airway, and port quality, PTAdepth measures the depth of the trade agreement between the host and source countries using the WTO RTA data, X is a vector of other country characteristics including a dummy variable for sharing border, a dummy for using same language, a dummy for sharing colonial ties, and a measure of business environment using the number of days required to start a business, and are vectors of country dummies used to control for all time-invariant country characteristics, and ia a vector of year dummies.",
    "To measure FDI regulations across countries, we use the Investing Across Borders data set, which compares FDI laws and regulations across 87 economies.",
    "Most of the factors that have been considered in the literature exert significant and expected effects.",
    "The value of each index is based on the average value of sub-indices.16 Table A.5 reports the summary statistics of the Investing across Borders data.",
    "This result, in alignment with Feyrer (2009) which shows similar findings for trade, can be explained by the endogenous selection of goods into the different transportation mode and the increasing usage of air and railway transportation with the technological improvement in air and rail transportation and the proliferation of GVCs.",
    "In this sub-section, we focus on China's outward investment; given the available information in the CGIT data set, we can differentiate China's investment across types and sectors.",
    "Similar findings are shown in Carr, Markusen, and Maskus (2001) who incorporate both horizontal and vertical FDI into a knowledge-capital model of multinational firms and offer support to both market access and knowledge capital hypotheses.",
    "Tables 21 and 22 present the OLS and the IV results, respectively.",
    "Section 2 reviews the existing literature evaluating the patterns, determinants, and effects of FDI as well as existing analysis on BRI.",
    "The economic impacts of FDI have been studied in a large body of literature, through macro, crosscountry analysis as well as micro, firm-level research.",
    "(2014) when evaluating the employment effects of imports and instrument FDI inflow to a host country with average FDI inflow to countries that have similar income levels and are located in the same geographic region as the host country."
