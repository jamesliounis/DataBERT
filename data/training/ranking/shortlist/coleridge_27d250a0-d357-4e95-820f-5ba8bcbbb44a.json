    "It is worth noting that all the prediction models were trained using the ADNI I dataset, and validated using the ADNI Go & 2 dataset.",
    "The characteristics of the cohorts included in this study are summarized in table 1.",
    "We evaluated the proposed method and compared it with state-of-the-art alternative methods based on the same training and validation datasets.",
    "Several studies have also demonstrated that the residual connection would accelerate the convergence and improve the performance of the CNNs (Szegedy et al., 2017) .",
    "We used MRI data (total n=817 scans, with 228 NC, 236 sMCI, 161 pMCI, and 192 AD patients) from ADNI 1 to train the proposed classification model.",
    "Our deep learning model was trained based on the ADNI 1 data and validated on the independent cohort of ADNI GO and ADNI 2.",
    "For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.",
    "Then we validated the Deep Ordinal Ranking method with independent data (total n=959 scans with 311 NC, 395 sMCI, 94 pMCI and 158 AD patients) from the cohorts ADNI GO and ADNI 2.",
    "The comparison with the traditional multi-category classification methods based on the ADNI dataset has demonstrated that our method could achieve promising performance, indicating that the utilization of inherent ordinal severity of brain degeneration associated with AD's different stages could help achieve improved classification performance.",
    "However, Bayesian optimization methods could be used to tune our models (Snoek et al., 2012) , and better performance could be obtained.",
    "The deep learning models was implemented using Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) , and trained on a Nividia Titan X (Pascal) graphics processing unit (GPU).",
    "1b , has been adopted widely since its invention (He et al., 2016) and achieved promising performance in many challenging pattern recognition tasks.",
    "\", and \"larger than pMCI?\".",
    "Several studies have specifically focused on the hippocampus for early diagnosis of AD and build predictive models upon anatomical features including volume and shape based measures, and image intensity texture features Devanand et al., 2012; Ben Ahmed et al., 2015; de Vos et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Aderghal et al., 2017; Tsao et al., 2017) .",
    "We first performed a binary classification task for distinguishing the AD patients from the NC individuals using the shape representation, radiomics representation, and deep representation respectively with a two-fold purpose.",
    "To boost the deep learning model's performance and robustness to image alignment and hippocampus segmentation errors, data augmentation is adopted to generate more training data (Goodfellow et al., 2016) .",
    "The deep learning model was optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004) , the momentum was set to 0.9, and the base learning rate was set to 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .",
    "We experimented with baseline MRI scans of 1776 subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1, ADNI GO, and ADNI 2.",
    "The structural variation between the hippocampus of AD patients and healthy subjects has been studied intensively (Qiu et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2015; Tsao et al., 2017) (Li et al., 2007; Chupin et al., 2009; Gerardin et al., 2009; Costafreda et al., 2011; Devanand et al., 2012; Ben Ahmed et al., 2015; de Vos et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Sorensen et al., 2016; Aderghal et al., 2017; Tsao et al., 2017) .",
    "It is expected to obtain improved classification performance to extract informative features from the whole brain MRI data.",
    "Most existing studies have been focusing on binary classification problems, e.g., distinguishing AD patients from normal control (NC) elderly or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals from NC elderly.",
    "It could be observed that the CNNs model obtained better performance than the RF method using shape and radiomics representations, and the performance under the ordinal ranking setting were generally better than their counterparts under the conventional multi-category classification setting.",
    "These hippocampus regions, referred to as hippocampal MRI images hereafter, were used as the input to the proposed deep ordinal ranking model.",
    "First, the current study focused on the hippocampus in AD diagnosis, and obtained similar classification performance as those methods based on the whole brain information (Liu et al., 2015b) .",
    "Generally speaking, the AD group and NC group were separated pretty well by all the models, our Deep Ordinal Ranking model captured the progressive patterns of the AD better than other models, as the larger coefficients of the confusion matrix located at the nearby positions along the diagonal of the matrix, indicating that misclassified subjects were assigned to adjacent categories in the progression spectrum, instead of the distant categories.",
    "Our results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than traditional multi-category classification techniques using shape and radiomics features from structural MRI data.",
    "These plots indicated that AD patients and NC elderly could be roughly separated based on their hippocampus volumes.",
    "The best performance was obtained by the Deep Ordinal Ranking model, and the adjusted accuracy was 0.465.",
    "This has also been demonstrated in Fig.",
    "Given training data {( , ), = 1,2, \u2026 , } , where represents the feature vector for subject and \u2208 {1,2,3,4} represents its associated category label, the 4-category label could be transformed into a binary label for each binary \"larger than\" problem.",
    "T1 MRI scans of all the subjects were registered to the MNI space using affine registration and resampled with a spatial resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 .",
    "Although these representations have been investigated and achieved promising performance, as handcrafted features they might be not optimal and less discriminative for the AD diagnosis.",
    "Conversion to AD within 2 or 3 years are generally used for the identification of pMCI in the literature.",
    "In total, 21242 spatial translated images, and 84824 non-rigid registered images were generated as the augmented dataset for training the deep learning model.",
    "Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Deep Ordinal Ranking model.",
    "Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve improved prediction performance.",
    "In our study, the four-category label of each subject \u2208 {1,2,3,4} is transformed into a 3-bit binary label encoding its status corresponding to the 3 binary \"larger than\" problems, i.e., the brain degeneration \"larger than normal aging?",
    "Ordinal regression based on CNNs has also been adopted for age estimation, and achieved better performance than state-of-theart alternative techniques (Niu et al., 2016) .",
    "Benefiting from the flexible architecture of proposed deep model, the performance of our method might be further improved if multimodality information is taken into account, e.g., PET imaging and CSF biomarkers (Liu et al., 2015a) .",
    "In these studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely adopted to learn informative imaging features by optimizing a pattern recognition cost function.",
    "For the -th binary problem ( > ), its positively labeled training dataset + and negatively labeled training dataset \u2212 could be constructed as\nBased on the training dataset, a binary classifier could be trained using any pattern classification techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) and random forests (RF) (Tin Kam, 1998) .",
    "We have evaluated the proposed method based on a large cohort of subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including ADNI 1, ADNI GO, and ADNI 2.",
    "The performance of the classification is evaluated with the following metrics: (1) normalized confusion matrix, (2) adjusted classification accuracy, (3) receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and area under ROC (AUC).",
    "The two 256-dimensional feature vector is concatenated and fed to FC2 with 3 output nodes for the deep ordinal ranking model (4 output nodes for the deep multi-category classification model).",
    "The built-in RF implementation TreeBagger in Matlab (R2013a) was adopted to train the model, and default values were used for other parameters.",
    "Besides classification, our proposed method is also a better fit for regression studies of AD associated clinical score estimation than simple metric regression, since most of the clinical score measures, e.g., mini mental state examination (MMSE), are not continuous variables.",
    "The success of deep learning techniques in pattern recognition (Goodfellow et al., 2016) in recent years have witnessed promising performance in learning imaging features for a variety of pattern recognition tasks (Gulshan et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2016; Esteva et al., 2017) .",
    "Particularly, augmented image data were generated using image translation and non-rigid deformable image registration techniques.",
    "Given the imaging data of hippocampus of each subject, different kinds of feature representations could be extracted, such as shape representation and radiomic characterization of image texture measures within the hippocampus regions (Rathore et al., 2017) .",
