  "k": 50,
  "shortlist": [
    "All analyses were conducted using Stata (StataCorp, 2011) .",
    "We build on the work of Ansari and colleagues (2016) and examine these associations in the Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 data set, a nationally representative sample of Head Start children and classrooms.",
    "Before doing so, however, we looked at the patterns of missing data and found that there were 151 missing data patterns for the 4-year-old cohort and 212 missing data patterns for the 3-year-old cohort, suggesting that data were not systematically missing (see also Chien & Mistry, 2013) .",
    "In the current study, we used data from the first two waves of data collection (fall 2009 and spring 2010) as we were interested in understanding how classroom characteristics were associated with children's academic gains and behavioral change across one year of preschool.",
    "They also reported how many were 3 years of age or younger (M = 7.11, SD = 5.17), 4 \nEstimates to the left of the diagonal correspond to the correlation matrix for 4-year-olds, whereas estimates to the right of the diagonal correspond to the correlation matrix for 3-year-olds.",
    "All models included the covariates listed in Table 1 .",
    "Table 1 provides sample descriptives and comparisons of children across age cohorts.",
    "As part of our modeling strategy, we also used robust standard errors clustered at the classroom level to adjust for the nesting of children in classrooms.",
    "These dimensions of classroom quality are informed by existing theory (Pianta & Hamre, 2009 ) and empirically supported with validation studies and factor analyses of over 4,000 classrooms across the United States, yielding a similar three-factor structure solution (Hamre, Pianta, Mashburn, & Downer, 2007) .",
    "We use data from the 2009 FACES cohort, which followed a nationally representative sample of 3,349 3-and 4-year-old first-time Head Start attendees across 486 classrooms.",
    "Lastly, our measure of age composition was based on teacher report as administrative report is not available in any existing national data set and the measure focuses on age in years, as opposed to months.",
    "We then probed the interactions using simple slopes to determine whether the influences of the predictor varied significantly at different levels of the moderator.",
    "With the aforementioned specifications in mind, we estimated a series of regression models (one for each outcome) separately by age cohort.",
    "Our first focal analysis, also reported in Table 3 , examined the interaction between age composition and classroom quality.",
    "To address issues of missing data (5%-18%), we imputed 50 data sets through the chained equations method.",
    "Given the fairly strong correlation across these three domains (rs = 0.49-0.74), for our focal analyses, we focus on the overall CLASS score as an indicator of the quality of teacher-child interactions (\u03b1 = .80).",
    "For example, older research has documented both positive and negative associations between mixed-age classrooms and various aspects of how children spent their time, including time spent in play and children's engagement in conversation (Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993; Goldman, 1981; Urberg & Kaplan, 1986; Winsler et al., 2002) .",
    "Clustered standard errors are one way to address the fact that there is independence of observations across clusters but children within clusters (in our case, classrooms) share some similarities that result in bias in the standard errors of coefficients (for examples of preschool research that uses this approach, see also Duncan et al., 2015; Weiland & Yoshikawa, 2014) .",
    "We first replicated the associations between classroom age composition and children's learning and development, which were presented by Ansari and colleagues (2016) .",
    "All models also included longitudinal weights to address cross-wave attrition and ensure that the data were nationally representative.",
    "We also adjusted for a theoretically relevant set of child-, household-, teacher-, and classroomlevel variables.",
    "However, other related work from Tulsa's pre-K programs has revealed that there is a large degree of variation in pre-K impacts more generally as a function of classroom instructional quality (Johnson, Markowitz, Hill, & Phillips, 2016) , which supports the general notions discussed previously.",
    "It is important to note that all nonfocal variables in Table 1 serve as covariates in all analyses.",
    "As recently summarized by Burchinal (2017) , evidence suggests that associations between the CLASS and children's outcomes are modest and may be due to measurement challenges; although CLASS observers often score within one point of another, they rarely get closer (or an exact match), which is problematic because the standard deviation of the CLASS is often 0.50 points, which means that even small differences between raters are quite meaningful in terms of CLASS scores.",
    "First, and similar to other emerging studies in the educational literature (Keys et al., 2013; McCoy, Connors, Morris, Yoshikawa, & Friedman-Krauss, 2015; Weiland, Ulvestad, Sachs, & Yoshikawa, 2013) , we found only small and either marginal or nonsignificant relations between the quality of teacherchild interactions and children's academic and behavioral outcomes for both age cohorts.",
    "Because there were only a small number of 5-year-olds, we included them with the 4-year-olds (for a similar method, see Moiduddin et al., 2012) .",
    "These assessments tapped into children's classification, comparison, and shape recognition skills and were combined by the FACES 2009 data collection team.",
    "Likewise, prior research has shown that young children's academic skills are affected more by early care and education programs than their social behaviors (Forry, Davis, & Welti, 2013; Puma et al., 2010; Winsler et al., 2008) .",
    "Moreover, missing data patterns did not differ greatly across the two cohorts (all standardized mean differences were 10% of a standard deviation or less).",
    "Importantly, we hypothesize that the influence of these interactions varies by children's own age, which is recognized as a \"person\" characteristic (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) or a referent status in other peer effects research (Justice, Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011) .",
    "By examining a national sample of preschoolers, we are able to document the specific conditions under which mixed-age classrooms are most beneficial and least harmful to the development of preschoolers.",
    "All estimates were weighted to be nationally representative and estimated within the 50 imputed data sets.",
    "In this study, we examined these complex relations and documented how the influence of the age of classroom peers varied based on children's own age along with classroom quality and teachers' education and experience.",
    "During the fall of 2009, teachers reported how many children were in their classroom (M = 17.15, SD = 2.21).",
    "Because each of the assessments was scored on different scales, we created standardized scores for each and averaged them to create a composite for language and literacy (Time 1 \u03b1 = .65; Time 2 \u03b1 = .68; for a similar approach with comparable reliability, see Duncan et al., 2015) .",
    "If there was evidence for moderation, we interpreted the interaction by calculating the predicted outcome scores for different combinations of classroom age composition and the moderator, using standard deviation cut points.",
    "For example, a large-scale study of pre-kindergarten programs from across the country found that measures of process quality were more strongly associated with children's gains in language, literacy, and social development compared with numerous indicators of structural quality .",
    "Although age composition influences overshadowed those related to classroom quality, there are important takeaway messages specific to these findings.",
    "All models adjusted for children's baseline skills; that is, we estimate whether classroom age composition was associated with changes in children's school readiness outcomes, which is one of the strongest adjustments for omitted variable bias (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network & Duncan, 2003) .",
    "We discuss the take-home messages of our work in the following.",
    "Thus, future work should incorporate more specific behavioral measures thought to be influenced by peers, such as empathy and leadership, and should rely on stronger measures that can better capture change in these behaviors.",
    "The only other study we are aware of that examined interactions between classroom quality and age composition found that high scores on behavior management were associated with greater gains in children's vocabulary skills when children were in mixedage classrooms (Guo et al., 2014) .",
    "We also estimated models with quadratic terms included.",
    "Although our hypothesis focused on the overall quality of children's classrooms, we found similar patterns of findings when looking at the specific dimensions of the CLASS, which captured Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support.",
    "All continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and, thus, estimates correspond to effect sizes.",
    "As discussed previously, we also estimated a series of models that looked at the three dimensions of the CLASS (both simultaneously and separately) and found that our results were not driven by any one dimension of the measure.",
    "As a precaution, however, we also estimated a series of models that looked at the 6 three dimensions of the CLASS (i.e., emotional, organizational, and instructional support) as opposed to an overall composite.",
    "Finally, all continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, and therefore, all estimates correspond to effect sizes (e.g., a Cohen's d).",
    "Although there was a significant interaction between age composition and classroom quality, the influence was not consistent with our hypothesis.",
    "The main effects estimates for age composition, quality, and teachers' education and experience were derived from the same model, which did not include the interaction terms."
