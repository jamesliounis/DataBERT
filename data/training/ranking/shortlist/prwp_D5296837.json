    "The paper is organized as follows.",
    "The data set on foreign lobbying used in this paper was provided by the US Department of Justice.",
    "A discussion of the empirical methodology can be found in the next section.",
    "3 So far most of the literature has focused on the United States mainly due to data constraints (see Gawande and Krishna, 2002) .",
    "Most of the recent empirical and analytical literature is based on the work 1 Throughout this paper, we abuse the definition of Latin America to include Caribbean countries also; i.e., Latin America is defined as the Western Hemisphere minus Canada and the US.",
    "Note that one may have a preference for the results reported in columns (5) and (6) , which use Latin American exports to the rest of the world, which are likely to be less endogenous than exports to the world (which includes exports to the US).",
    "This section discusses the data sources and variable construction and provides a description of the pattern of Latin American lobbying and tariff preferences by country and sector.",
    "Finally, the sixth column provides our preferred estimate of a and corrects for both for heteroskedasticity and endogeneity of our righthand-side variable, as well as controlling for any industry or country specific effect.",
    "See the appendix for a description of the instruments used.",
    "The one explored in this paper is that contribution functions may not necessarily be continuous as generally assumed in the empirical literature.",
    "For a detailed description of how foreign agents operate, seeJobst (2003).9 See the appendix for more information on foreign lobbying data.",
    "Table 1 provides results for the estimation of a stochastic version of (10) for our sample of Latin American countries.",
    "One characteristic of the foreign lobbying expenditure data is the high concentration by sector and country.",
    "21 Our preferred estimates are those in the last column, where we control for any systematic country or product variation in preference (as well as for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity).",
    "22 Results are very similar to the ones reported in Table   1 .",
    "The tariff data was aggregated to the 3-digit ISIC classification using the HS 8-digit exports of each Latin American country to the US within a 3-digit ISIC classification as weights (both for the Latin American tariff and for the MFN tariffs).",
    "The fourth column further corrects for the potential heteroskedasticity introduced by aggregating the data at the industry level when preferences are determined at the tariff line level.",
    "If we go by our preferred estimates in the last two columns of Table 1 , it seems that returns of foreign lobbying are lower for the non-Mexico Latin American countries.",
    "25 The first two columns in Table 3 Table 3 are consistent with the ones reported so far.",
    "Empirical estimates suggests that there is a non trivial role for domestic lobbying in the determination of the US trade policy (see Gawande, 1997 , Gawande and Bandhopadhyay, 2000 and Goldberg and Maggi, 1999 ).",
    "Interior values for \u03b8 i k will be obtained by aggregation in the empirical part, or simply because rules of origin only allow certain exporters from a particular country to benefit from the preferences on paper.",
    "The second column provides estimates with the endogeneity correction and the third column adds a constant to the endogeneity correction.",
    "We used the FARA reports for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.",
    "For a recent review of this literature seeGrossman and Helpman (2001).4 Studies focused on developing countries include Cadot, de Melo and Olarreaga (2003), Cadot, Grether and Olarreaga (2003), Gawande, Sanguinetti and Bohara, (2003) and Mitra, Thomakus and Ulubasoglu (2002).5 Most of the empirical literature in the US actually mainly explains non-tariff barriers.",
    "Section 3 presents the analytical setup.",
    "In our econometric approach, measurement error in lobbying expenditures (such as under-reporting) will be corrected by the use of instrumental variables (see next section).",
    "Most of the paper excludes these contributions, except for the section on robustness tests, where these contributions are included in the econometric analysis.",
    "In the first stage we run the ratio of contributions to Latin American exports (C i k /[t k x i k ]) on the instruments described above.",
    "In a related paper Jobst (2002) focuses on the impact that foreign lobbying by Latin American countries had on their export growth to the United States.",
    "In such a case the returns to foreign lobbying are higher (although not statistically so) than those reported in columns (5) and (6) Finally, note that lobbying only explains a very small part of the tariff preference variation.",
    "In order to correct for this potential heteroskedasticity problem, we follow a parametric correction suggested by Dickens (1990) .",
    "The purpose of this paper is to assess the importance of lobbying by foreign exporters in determining the extent of tariff preferences granted by an importing country.",
    "As a robustness check we provide results including government agencies lobbying expenditures and other business associations that we could not allocate to any specific industry with the data provided by the DOJ.",
    "Finally, we calculated the average lobbying expenditure over this four year period by 3-digit ISIC industry and by country.",
    "This mapping process was repeated for each entry found on the FARA report for 33 countries in Latin America.",
    "where m k are total home imports of good k, x i k are exports of good k by country i, which is lobbying for preferences.",
    "Although the empirical literature has found significant support for the idea that domestic and foreign lobbying are important determinants of trade policy in the United States, it still faces an important puzzle: most estimates of the weight granted to social welfare relative to lobbying contributions in the US government's objective function are extremely high: generally above 100.",
    "The estimates of a that use government agencies lobbying expenditures are smaller than those reported in Table 1 and the returns to foreign lobbying are somehow higher: between 62 and 97 percent depending on the method used to distribute government agencies lobbying expenditures across 2-digit ISIC sectors.",
    "Note that without this cleaning of the data the ratio of lobbying expenditure to potential tariff revenue foregone could be as high as 30,000, which is clearly misleading.",
    "When aggregating tariff and trade data from the 8-digit HS level to the 3-digit ISIC level one may introduce some heteroskedasticity due to group aggregation if one believes that the equation to be estimated is determined at the 8-digit HS level and if the number of 8-digit HS tariff lines in each 3-digit ISIC industry is not the same.",
    "First, we used the lobbying country exports to the world as weights to distribute across sectors.",
    "8 First we separated the foreign lobbying expenditure data related to trade on agricultural and industrial goods from those involving trade in services and other types of foreign lobbying 9 .",
    "Because half of the lobbying expenditures we identified as being trade-related were undertaken by government agencies or other generic business associations, it seems important to check the results when these are included.",
    "This is higher (although not statisically so) than the 32 percent return obtained in the results provided inTable 2, when lobbying expenditures by government agencies and regional chambers of commerce are not included.",
    "23 This is consistent with anecdotal evidence that the foreign lobbying process has a learning component.",
    "It consists in estimating (10) To obtain asymptotically efficient estimates, one re-weighs each observation at the industry level using these variance estimates.",
    "We used the same weights in order to avoid aggregation bias when moving from the tariff line level to the 3-digit ISIC level.",
    "Finally, contrary to the empirical literature for the United States described above we found very low values for the estimates of the weight granted to social welfare in the government's objective function (around two times the weight granted to foreign lobbying contributions), which underscores the importance of foreign (and domestic) lobbying in determining US trade policies.",
    "The FARA annual reports contain the name and address of foreign agents, the name of the principals, the purpose of the agency and the amount of money in return for the agent's activities.",
    "Because the contribution data is only available at the 3-digit ISIC level, we needed to filter our tariff preferences from the 8-digit HS level to the 3-digit ISIC level."
