    "application was used to analyze the answers.",
    "The data obtained during the focus group survey were processed using the Textalyser web tool.",
    "In order to increase the validity of the survey results, a detailed review of the scientific literature on the relevant topic was conducted before developing the survey questionnaire.",
    "The quantitative data were analysed and consolidated in tables, represented as row percentages, and calculated using the Chi-Square statistical method.",
    "45-47) , a data collection process (Mishra, 2005) , a type of evaluation based on the collection of specific information (Noh, 2006) .",
    "The Textalyzer web tool was used to process the data obtained through the focus group survey.",
    "As shown in the chart (see Figure 1 ), the study was conducted in several stages: preparatory (goal-setting), introductory (monitoring and obtaining results) and reflexive (making adjustments to goals, measures and monitoring tools) and was of cyclical type.",
    "The analysis was conducted taking into account the objectives of the study.",
    "In addition, the data comparison strategy (Yin, 2014), triangulation of data sources (Yin, 2014; Stake, 1995) , and a study validation method (Stake, 1995) were used.",
    "To analyze the quantitative data, they were summarized into a table, as a percentage, and calculated using the Chi-Square statistical method.",
    "The calculated values for the participation of teachers in any training programs, the class, the number of pupils in the class and the number of pupils present on the monitoring day, attendance by Director of Studies and Methodologist using the Chi-Square statistical method are higher than the values of the Table by 0 .05, which indicates the weight of these components in monitoring support (see Table 2 ).",
    "The monitoring effectiveness was then evaluated by the Pedagogical Council of a school-participant on the basis of the data, as well as a survey of teachers.",
    "The literature review allowed us to identify scientific sources that cover the categorical framework for education monitoring (Hoover, 2009; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016) , the principles of monitoring in the primary school education process (Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016) , and the impact-factors to its effectiveness (Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Fulton, 2018) .",
    "As a rule, monitoring data is collected at the offices of Directors of Studies, and such data are provided upon results of observation.",
    "In addition, the data comparison strategy, triangulation of data sources, and study validation method were used.",
    "A sample size calculator (Google Apps) was used to determine the size of a representative sample to ensure the quality and reliability of the experiment results.",
    "The results of the study can be regarded as a baseline due to several limitations, which include a number of participants, potential bias in school choice and limited availability for observation.",
    "Most of the empirical studies on this issue that we have considered have used a quantitative approach to analyzing the results.",
    "In scientific sources, the term \"monitoring\" is defined as a system of ongoing, interim and summary evaluation (Mertens, 2009, pp.",
    "Third, this study tested the framework and principles for monitoring primary school education process and addressed the aspects of its effectiveness (Hoover, 2009; Kayani, et al, 2011; Mngomezulu, 2015; Ferdaus, 2016; Fulton, 2018) .",
    "Several tools were used to collect the data, including: classroom observations, lesson checklists (evaluation forms), lesson plans evaluation forms, interviews for teachers and parents, focus group survey questionnaires.",
    "This study goes in line with our literature review findings and contributes to the study of the problem of introducing monitoring in the educational process in primary school.",
    "First, the study broadened previous studies dedicated to motivation of pupils and increasing their learning engagement (through improving teaching skills and, accordingly, optimizing teaching and learning) (Niyivuga, Otara & Tuyishime, 2019) .",
    "The test tasks were developed based on productive foreign experience in comparative education quality studies: PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) and TIMSS (The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study for fourth-and eighth-formers (UCEQA, 2018) .",
    "As we can see from Table 2 , the highest scores correspond to the answers of Directors of Studies and parents, while the values for teachers are lower, though significant and illustrative.",
    "These materials were developed under the expert assistance of a specialist in the field of pedagogy of primary school Martynenko Svitlana Mykolaivna, Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences, Professor.",
    "Therefore, the required sample size was 16 people, and this number was used to form a representative sample.",
    "2) What exactly did you do in this project?",
    "Several data collection tools recommended for qualitative and quantitative studies were applied in this research (Stake, 1995) , namely: classroom observations, lesson checklists (evolutionary forms), study of lesson plans, semistructured interviews for teachers and parents, focus group survey questionnaires, were used to identify how primary school teachers perceive introduction of monitoring support practices and what factors have a decisive influence on their positive or negative perception of this measure.",
    "The results of the study made it possible to identify the conditions, limitations and factors that influence teachers' decisions regarding the implementation of monitoring support in the primary school education process.",
    "Those were compliance monitoring (to ensure that certain formal standards of education are met), diagnostic monitoring (to determine effort-cost ratio in measuring pupils' educational achievements) and performance monitoring (to compare schools and educational districts) (Ferdaus, 2016) .",
    "Additionally, we discovered that every type is based on the further outlined stages (as suggested by Hoover (2009)) being exploratory (identification and selection of what and how to monitor and assess, and designing a monitoring schedule), implementation (activities aimed at checking parameters, assessing the performance and progress) and reflexion (making changes and improvements).",
    "Our study found three types of a monitoring system specified by their purpose.",
    "3) What benefits of participating in the project made you feel delighted about it?",
    "Of 32 teachers remaining after applying these criteria, 16 were involved in this study by random sampling and calculation of a representative sample (see Table 1 ).",
    "Developing the system of the above-mentioned local monitoring system, we came to the conclusion that the priority should be given to the need to adopt a formative and non-engaged position and to establish a system that will provide useful information that will help improve the existing process on a continuous basis.",
    "In Ukraine, monitoring is conducted \"to identify and track trends in the quality of education\u2026; establishment of conformity of actual results of educational activity with the stated goals, estimation of degree and reasons of deviations from the goals\" (Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, 2019).",
    "Together with the introduction of these educational innovation practices, the participants in this study have formulated such challenges as: a) adaptation to a changed role (Durlak & DuPre, 2008) ; b) establishing productive collaboration with other teachers (Fullan, 2014) .",
    "At this stage, a sample of teachers who responded to an official request from the Departments of Education and declared their participation in our study (a total of 87 people) was formed.",
    "The results of the study are preliminary due to several limitations, which include a small number of participants, potential bias in school choice and limited opportunities for observation.",
    "Adequate, comprehensive and ongoing monitoring is a key aspect of the successful implementation of any educational program (Environmental Change Institute, 2014; Sima, 2006; Bibik, 2017; Grischenko, 2016) .",
    "Moreover, there was a dynamic in pupil attendance rates and results of their educational activity.",
    "Therefore, in this study, we used quantitative and qualitative approaches to reveal the contextual and dynamic nature of the primary school teacher's experience in monitoring (monitoring support) of educational activities at the specified educational level (Creswell & Poth, 2018) .",
    "The research conditions, constraints and contextual factors that influenced teachers' perception of this innovation were identified.",
    "The objects of this study were teachers of government-owned schools in Kyiv, Odesa, Ternopil and Kharkiv.",
    ", and lasted for the first half of 2019.",
    "Given that n (population) = 32, confidence interval = 7.18, and e = 0.1, if",
    "Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore how primary school teachers perceive the practice of implementing monitoring support on the basis of autonomous monitoring groups by educational level, and what factors have a decisive influence on their positive or negative perception of the above approach to assessing educator/student effectiveness.",
    "However, the respondents reported some motivation and procrastination issues, along with reluctance to criticism and feedback provided by their colleagues.",
    "The procedure of the measure includes test tasks and questionnaires."
