  "shortlist": [
    "These results reinforce the findings reported by Dinar, Karagiannis, and Tzouvelekas (2007) that the provision of information services should be targeted based on socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and physical characteristics of the farm operation.",
    "Table 1 shows the variable descriptions and summary statistics for the dependent and independent variables.",
    "A description of the survey and summary results are available from the OFRF (www.ofrf.org).",
    "Liu and Peng (2010) noted that the quantile regression model provides a more complete view of how the distribution of the dependent variable (visits) changes with the conditional quantile.",
    "Researchers implementing this technique using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey can exploit information about farmers' earnings in the previous year.",
    "As shown in Table 3 , the 75% z a -quantile of the jittered data evaluated at the mean of the continuous variables and the mode of the dummy variables is Q z 5 (0.75jX) 5 [5.584] .",
    "Sufficient detail was available to use 810 observations from the survey.",
    "The composite index of Internet use is:\nwhere U is the total number of sources consulted.",
    "The results should be interpreted with caution if selectivity effects are important.",
    "The components of the Internet use index are included in the count data model in log-linear form as To assess regional differences in institutional support and information availability for organic production and marketing systems, we used the four USDA SARE regions (see www.sare.org/ about/regions.htm for a listing of states in each region).",
    "The results relate to the KYF2 program by showing that the producer's level of local sales within 100 miles of the farm increases the visits to private information providers at the 50% z a -quantile.",
    "Machado and Santos Silva (2005) suggest averaging out the noise that was artificially added to the data.",
    "Koenker and Hallock (2001) showed that asymptotically valid inferences on the parameters of the quantile can be made given that the conditional probability density function f (Yjx) is continuous.",
    "Comprehensive data on production and marketing practices, demographic information, and information sources used by U.S. organic farmers were gathered from the Fourth OFRF survey of all certified producers of record as of 2001 (Walz, 2004) .",
    "We estimated selected conditional quantiles of the continuity-corrected counts by using the specification: The dependent variable shows considerable overdispersion because the conditional variance (24.32) is greater than the conditional mean (6.70).",
    "The variable for the provision of extension services in Dinar's analysis was count data on the number of visits, an indicator with a substantial degree of heterogeneity across the types of farms in the study region.",
    "The explanatory variables included in the count data model for information sources include total gross organic farming income (OrganicIncome) and farm size measured as the acreage farmed organically (OrganicAcres).",
    "Future research can investigate additional instruments and controls (such as lagged income) to account for potential endogeneity, but these lagged values may require panel survey data or the addition of new questions to the OFRF survey.",
    "Winkelmann (2006) addressed the empirical issue of how to choose the quantiles and we use that approach in model specification.",
    "Natural logs of the continuous variables were used as indicated in the model specification in Table 2 .",
    "The quantiles for visits to information providers are the values that divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile.",
    "These results are particularly compelling when compared with percentages of use and ratings of the information provided by the USDA and state agriculture departments.",
    "The results for the quantile regression and the negative binomial model are shown in Table 2 .",
    "A test of the null hypothesis that r 2 5 0 uses a Wald or Lagrange Multiplier test.",
    "These findings have management implications for predicting visits to private information providers.",
    "The quantile regression model for count data suggests that the impact of farm size has different effects across the distribution of demand for technical information.",
    "A set of instruments was identified that is highly correlated with each of the variables.",
    "The test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of potentially endogenous variables.",
    "To implement the procedure to test for endogeneity, estimate the reduced form by ordinary least squares (OLS) to obtain the OLS estimates.",
    "Machado and Santos Silva (2005) developed a quantile count regression model based on a smoothing algorithm by constructing a continuous variable with conditional quantiles that have a one-to-one relationship with the conditional quantiles of the counts.",
    "Dinar, Karagiannis, and Tzouvelekas (2007) evaluated the impact of extension on farm performance in Crete, Greece, using a nonneutral stochastic production frontier model.",
    "To the extent that marketing information and information access have an effect on retention, attention must be paid to availability and delivery.",
    "Quantile regression techniques have an advantage in their ability to describe the differential impact of an explanatory variable across the response distribution.",
    "The dependent variable was the number of times these private organizations were consulted (ConsultPrivate).",
    "Wooldridge notes the procedure is very robust and can be applied when the y 2 contains binary, count, or other discrete variables.",
    "We included variables describing Internet use, because web distribution is a frequently used method for informationseeking by organic farmers and on locality of market, because farmers selling locally are more likely to be concerned with resource constraints and regulatory costs than information needs (Kambara and Shelley, 2002) .",
    "The implication is that Internet use is a positive indicator of the demand for visits to private agricultural associations and can be used to predict future demand for services from the associations.",
    "To motivate the approach, Figure 1 plots the number of visits that organic producers make to private information providers as a function of the farmer's organic acreage.",
    "We apply a technique for estimating quantile regressions for count data, represented here by the number of visits that organic farmers make to private information providers.",
    "Quantile regression for count data examines how quantiles of the conditional distribution of a response variable recorded in discrete units (number of visits) depend on a set of explanatory variables.",
    "The procedure requires that m draws from the U(0, 1) distribution are taken and the average of the QR estimates of the m jittered samples (based on 1,000 draws) is calculated.",
    "A variable representing the producer's use of the Internet for marketing and sales (InternetUseIndex) was constructed based on activities defined in the OFRF survey.",
    "FR i is 1 if the source was used once per month or more frequently and 0 otherwise.",
    "The most frequently consulted market information organizations were organic certification agencies (eight times per user per year), marketing cooperatives (10 times per year), and growers' associations (six times per year) (Walz, 2004) .",
    "The third section outlines the econometric model and is followed by the data and variable descriptions.",
    "The presence of missing values for consultations with a private information provider when organic farmers did not respond to some of the questions may lead to some selectivity biases associated with these farmers.",
    "A quantile regression for the demand by organic farmers for consultations with private information providers is estimated.",
    "The empirical method we propose explicitly accounts for both the count nature of visits to private information providers and observed heterogeneity in consultations with experts sought by farmers.",
    "Internet use has a positive marginal effect on visits to private information providers across each quantile, suggesting that expanded efforts to deliver programs through web-based resources are a useful investment for information providers.",
    "A quantile regression for count data is estimated based on the demand of organic farmers for consultations with private information providers."
