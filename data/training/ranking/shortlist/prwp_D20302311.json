    "(2003) for a survey of the literature.",
    "In line with the rest of the literature, e.g.",
    "(2009) , Coeurdacier et al.",
    "The original source of the data is The Global Reference Solution, from Dun & Bradstreet.",
    "Data are collated through daily searches of Financial Times newswires and internal information sources, other media sources, project data received from industry organizations and investment agencies, and data purchased from market research and publication companies.",
    "Our key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral M&A transactions.",
    "The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.",
    "Our FDI data come from the fDi Markets database compiled by fDi Intelligence, a division of the Financial Times.",
    "This result, coupled with the empirical findings of Bilir et al.",
    "77 Disaggregated data are reported in Table 6 .",
    "A second contribution lies in the FDI data that we employ to implement our empirical approach.",
    "In column 1of Table 4 , for reference, we reproduce the estimates reported in column (5) of Table 3 .",
    "Data come from Beck et al.",
    "Data have been downloaded from the UNCTAD Investment Map website in November 2007.",
    "The theoretical predictions and empirical findings ofBilir et al.",
    "Some studies resort to data from one source country to get better proxies (e.g.",
    "Thanks to these various data sources, we are able to undertake a much more thorough investigation of the effects of financial development on FDI than what currently exists in the literature.",
    "The key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral Mergers\\&Acquisitions transactions.",
    "At the most disaggregated level, the underlying data that we use to estimate models (1) and (2) correspond to 7604 greenfield FDI projects in a new production or processing facility made by 3919 parent companies located in 83 source (developed and developing) countries, in 13 broad manufacturing sectors of 125 (developed and developing) destination countries during the period 2003-2006.",
    "Tests for the statistical significance of the difference in estimates can be found at the bottom of Table 4 .",
    "Data on human capital stock come from Barro and Lee (2010) .",
    "(2005) , Di Giovanni (2005) , Hijzen et al.",
    "This suggests that the greenfield FDI data that we use in this paper are not affected by gross inconsistencies and are potentially representative of trends in both greenfield and M&A FDI.",
    "In the spirit of Bernard et al.",
    "On the source side, our results mirror those of Manova (2013) .",
    "In column (2), we show that our results hold when we limit our sample to those sector-country-pair observations for which we have data on 2002 sector-specific value added.",
    "Access to these data means that we can estimate our difference-in-differences approach, examine simultaneously the various effects of SFD and DFD on FDI, test whether external funds raised in source and destination countries are complements or substitutes, and look at the effects of financial development at both the intensive and extensive margins of FDI.",
    "Indeed, columns (2) show a strong relationship between FDI and the interactions of financial development with the ED young measure whereas in column (3) the coefficients on the interactions of financial development with the ED mature measure are not statistically significant at the 5% level.",
    "In columns (2) to (3) we replace our ED variable with ED measures which have been calculated by Rajan and Zingales (1998) for young firms (firms that went public less than 10 years ago) and mature firms (firms that have been public for at least 10 years).",
    "By using first the disaggregated M&A FDI and then collapsing them in the same way as we have done for the greenfield FDI data, we will show that the aggregation of sectors is not exerting a major influence on our qualitative results.",
    "On the source side, we observe that the magnitude of the coefficients on the SFD-ED and SFD-TANG interaction terms slightly decreases in column (3) relative to those in column (2).",
    "In a second stage, to assess the implications for our results of the compromises that we have made with the greenfield FDI data, we collapse the M&A data in 13 broad sectors and assume that the source sector is the same as the destination sector.",
    "By using U.S. data on publicly traded firms, Rajan and Zingales (1998) increase the likelihood that they correctly identify a sector's technological demand for external financing.",
    "Data come from the CEPII Trade and Production Database.",
    "In the last two columns, we use an alternative database to look at the overall effects of SFD and DFD on the relative number of majority-owned foreign affiliates located in developing countries at the end of the year 2006.",
    "Given that data are only available for the years 2005 and 2006, we use the average size of each index over these two years to construct our institution-based measure.",
    "Column (1) of Table 2 shows that the coefficients on the two interaction terms are large, positive, and statistically significant at the 1% level.",
    "Fortunately, the M&A FDI data that we exploit in Appendix C are available at a much more detailed sector level, allowing us to obtain a perfect correspondence between the M&A FDI data and the financial vulnerability measures.",
    "Data include the name of the country in which the firm engaging in M&A FDI is located, the name of the destination country, the year of completed transaction, the source sector, the recipient sector, the equity stake, and, sometimes, the deal value.",
    "81 We also include the sub-sectors of these 23 sectors for which Rajan and Zingales (1998) provide data on ED: 3411 (Pulp and paper), 3825 (Office and computing), 3832 (Radio), 3841 (Ship building), 3843 (Motor vehicles).",
    "46 Some descriptive statistics can be found in Appendix B, Table 7 .",
    "A comparison of columns (3) and (6) or columns (6) and (9) suggests that the overall positive effects of SFD or DFD on the relative volume of FDI in more financially vulnerable sectors mainly operate through an increase in the average size of FDI projects, with a smaller positive influence on the number of FDI projects.",
    "The ED measure developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998) is based on a sample of large U.S. companies, which are likely to have activities abroad.",
    "We aim to fill these gaps in this paper.",
    "This financial development measure, using unit-level data (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2012).",
    "In some cases, these broad sectors may not include data on subsectors, for which Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Kroszner et al.",
    "Given that we are interested in how financial development influences average project size when FDI occurs, the observations for which FDI is positive form an appropriate subsample of the population of interest (Wooldridge, 2010) .",
    "78 Rajan and Zingales (1998) , KLK: Kroszner et al.",
    "(2011) , Chor and Manova (2012) or Manova (2013) for an application of this approach in the fields of economic growth or international trade.",
    "The first-stage F -statistic indicates that the instruments are relevant, with a value well above the threshold identified as Staiger and Stock (1997) to qualify an instrument as strong (F \u2248 10)."
