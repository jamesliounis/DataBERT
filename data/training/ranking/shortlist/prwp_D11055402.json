    "This is presented in the following sections.",
    "[Insert Tables 11 and 12 about here]",
    "We also present the results of the estimation of the model for various sub-samples of the data, which are split at the median of potential technology-selection variables.",
    "Section 2 discusses the related literatures.",
    "To overcome this drawback, Harrigan and Zakrajsek [18] work with a larger sample, which includes data for up to 28 OECD and non-OECD countries and 12 industries from 1970-1992.",
    "[Insert Table 2 about here]",
    "Table 8 reports the p-values corresponding to the null hypothesis that the Rybczynski coefficients of the regimes in brackets are statistically equivalent.",
    "[Insert Table 8 about here]",
    "This paper marries these two literatures.",
    "It also documents the sources of data.",
    "We tested this theoretical model with data on net exports of a single industry, computers, intellectual property rights, factor endowments, and other controls for 73 countries over the period 1980-2000.",
    "Table 4 shows the estimations for various samples, depending on the selection variables.",
    "Elias [11] and Young [34] ).",
    "Redding[29] utilizes data on 20 industries in 7 OECD countries from 1970-1990.",
    "To assess if the data supports our theory, we compare the positions countries occupy in the net exports and relative factor endowments distributions.",
    "Evidence related to the second result has been documented by Harrigan and Zakrajsek [18] .",
    "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
    "Table 1 presents the summary statistics.",
    "The author employs manufacturing outputs and factor endowments data for up to 20 OECD countries during 1970-1985.",
    "The author uses manufacturing output shares and factor endowments data for up to 10 developed countries across 7 industries with data from 1970-1988.",
    "At least two distinct literatures are related to our model and empirical application.",
    "T he first column reports coefficients of the baseline model.",
    "Interestingly, the data in Table 2 A similar pattern is also observed in the final-goods computer industry.",
    "Two conclusions can be drawn from Table 4 .",
    "The specification tests corresponding to the complete model are reported in Table 10 .",
    "Evidence in line with the first result has also been provided by Harrigan [16] , David and Weinstein [8] , Bernstein and Weinstein [4] , and Leamer [24] .",
    "The data set covers 73 countries during 1980-2000.",
    "The econometric analyses utilize data on factor endowments, intellectual property rights (IPRs), and net exports of computers and components, an industry that has received much attention in the technology adoption and growth literature.",
    "The first tests the significance of the cutoff points or threshold values of the latent index, which split the samples into technological regimes.",
    "Using input-output data for six member countries of the European Community for the years 1970 and 1980, the paper shows that allowing for international technique differences significantly improves the predictive power of the H-O-V model.",
    "Harrigan [17] improves substantially upon previous empirical frameworks, but his OECD data have little cross-country variation as high-income countries have similar factor endowments and sectoral output shares.",
    "[Insert Table 3 about here] Consistent with Hakura [15] , the results improve when we estimate the model for different sub-samples.",
    "Data on lending interest rates, a proxy for the cost of capital, come from the International Financial Statistics data-set of the IMF.",
    "The resulting sample covers 73 developing and developed countries over the period 1980-2000.",
    "[Insert Table 4 about here]",
    "Table 3 presents the estimated Rybczynski coefficients under the assumption that all countries employ the same technology.",
    "In the second strand of the trade literature, Harrigan [17] provides the first empirical test of the factor proportions theory in a framework that accounts for international technology differences.",
    "In turn, we discuss results of ad-hoc two-regime models, where the data are divided into two groups depending on rankings based on technology selection variables, namely factor endowments, IPRs, TFP, and relative factor costs.",
    "The analyses focus on the computer industry, which has received a lot of attention in the technology adoption and growth literature.",
    "[Insert Table 9 about here]",
    "T he dependent variable is categorical and captures countries' technology choices.",
    "In turn, we report the results from the estimation of the selection equation of the optimal 2-regime, 3-regime, and 4-regime models, followed by a discussion of the estimated Rybczynski coefficients of the model that best fits the data.",
    "The most reliable inferences across sectors that can be obtained from this study are roughly consistent with Leamer [24] and Harrigan [16] .",
    "The Table shows that in spite of the fact that we employ the least efficient method to estimate the model, which delivers wider confidence intervals for the estimated parameters, there is substantial evidence supporting the theory.",
    "However, in order to study the implications of technology choices on the pattern of specialization, we assume that countries are clustered in K groups.",
    "[Insert Table 1 about here] Table 2 presents the list of countries that are located at the top and the bottom of the distribution of countries ranked according to their net exports of computers in 2000.",
    "[Insert Table 5 about here]",
    "Table 6 presents specification tests for the optimal models.",
    "[Insert Table 6 about here] Table 7 presents estimated Rybczynski coefficients for each technological regime.",
    "The first one is the trade literature on factor proportions and trade patterns."
