    "In the original work of Autor et al.",
    "Section 2 contains a review of the literature and discusses the contribution of this paper.",
    "To analyze if this could be affecting the results, Table 6 .",
    "This research is also based on data from the International Income Distribution Data Set (I2D2).",
    "Table 3 shows some descriptive statistics for these covariates, while Appendix A1 displays the country-year coverage of the sample.",
    "The empirical parameters are estimated using several data sets.",
    "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
    "The I2D2 is a data set of harmonized household surveys which are comparable across countries and time.",
    "We also construct indexes comparable to those thatAutor and Handel (2013) created for the US using the PDII survey.",
    "This research also contributes to the literature on the drivers of the skill content of jobs by using the World Bank's International Income Distribution Dataset (I2D2).",
    "Appendix 1 shows the country and time coverage of the sample used in this paper, which excludes the pre-1990 samples.",
    "As seen in Table 10 , the estimated coefficients associated with internet use and exports have in general the same signs as those of Table 5 , although the latter are no longer statistically significant.",
    "The O*NET specification refers back to the study of Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) .",
    "The use of multiple survey years per country allows us to increase the number of observations substantially, and thereby to increase the precision of our estimates in a cross-country regression setting and to control for unobserved heterogeneity across countries.",
    "The list of variables chosen to mimic the O*NET structure are reported in Table 1 .",
    "For example, Messina, Pica, and Oviedo (2014) find that the task content of occupations is similar between the US and Latin America with respect to abstract and routine tasks (with a correlation coefficient of around 0.5 to 0.6).",
    "As seen in Table 8 and Table 9 , the results are very similar for both samples, as the magnitudes of the main estimated coefficients are very close.",
    "While the data do not allow to test this assumption, we proceed by first checking if the basic correlations between the skill indexes and the level of GDP per capita still hold for the extended sample.",
    "There are some common patterns between the estimated coefficients associated with the rest of the covariates using the STEP-and O*NET-based measures.",
    "The O*NET data set is the outcome of such analysis for the US economy, with 44 different scores being assigned to each detailed level occupation.",
    "Since the results are very similar to those that mimic the O*NET, we do not report them, but they are available from the authors upon request.",
    "Our preferred estimate in column (2) for all age groups indicates that when internet penetration increases by 10 percentage points, employment rate growth is 2 percentage points lower in a country with a relatively high level of routine labor (Sri Lanka) with respect to one with a low level of routine labor (Argentina).",
    "In general, the results in Table 4 show that the association between GDP per capita and the skill content of jobs is weak once we control for unobserved heterogeneity across countries, time trends and time-variant country characteristics, in contrast to the strong link found when using crosssectional data.",
    "These findings are consistent with those of existing studies that rely on a more disaggregated classification of occupations.",
    "When applying these indexes to other developing countries that do not have a STEP survey, we use those calculated for the pooled sample (i.e.",
    "They analyze if the findings are different from those obtained when using US data from O*NET and investigate the drivers of the heterogeneity in the skill content of jobs across countries but not over time.",
    "Second, since the second goal of this paper is to make comparisons across countries and across time, it is not feasible to harmonize the occupational classifications for all the household surveys (which are around 600 in this study).",
    "The dependent variable \u2206 , ,",
    "Finally, we use several variables from the World Development Indicators (WDI), including GDP per capita PPP (both growth and level), ICT users (as a share of total population), population by age, exports and imports (both as a share of GDP).",
    "In addition to socio-economic, demographic, employment, education and family background information, the surveys contain a series of harmonized questions on specific tasks that the respondent uses in his or her job.",
    "We use the STEP surveys for 11 developing countries (Armenia, Bolivia, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, FYR Macedonia, Philippines, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Ukraine and Vietnam), collected between 2012 and 2016.",
    "Section 3 describes the data, while Section 4 presents the methodology and the estimated trends in the skill content of jobs.",
    "First, because for most of the countries covered in STEP surveys, the sample size is not large enough to make reliable inferences using more detailed occupations, as many of the cells would contain very few observations or be empty.",
    "This research contributes to this literature by analyzing trends in the skill content of jobs and their drivers, as well as the consequences for employment creation in developing economies.",
    "There is a large body of literature showing that, even in developed countries with flexible labor markets, trade and technology shocks have significant impacts on employment levels (see, for instance, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) ).",
    "Figure A2 2 illustrates the cases of Bolivia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, as the data for these countries cover a period (roughly 25 years) long enough to capture trends.",
    "Within this approach, two main methods can be distinguished in the literature.",
    "One of the main findings of this literature is that jobs are becoming less intensive in routine tasks across the world.",
    "Note: OLS coefficients from a cross-country regression using the employment rate as the dependent variable.",
    "Note: each figure is the average change between each country's first and last year in the sample, divided by the length of the period (in years).",
    "It was pioneered by Handel (2008) , who developed and used the STAMP survey (that later became the PDII), for the US.",
    "(2016) use data from STEP surveys to determine if the skill content of jobs is different from that suggested by USbased skill surveys.",
    "For example, and Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2009) document the process of employment and wage polarization affecting labor markets in the US and Europe since the 1980s and 1990s.",
    "Both sets of indexes show similar patterns regarding the link between economic development and the content of non-routine cognitive skills.",
    "These findings could be driven by the fact that the level of development may be correlated with the speed at which the demand for skills and the adoption of new technologies take place.",
    "To our knowledge, there are only three studies that use data on the task content of occupations from developing countries instead of relying on data from the US.",
    "Given that the number of observations is significantly smaller, we estimate more parsimonious specifications by replacing year dummy variables with decade dummy variables.",
    "The sample is an unbalanced panel of countries with annual frequency (see Appendix 1).",
    "Several other coefficients become statistically significant in this sample, but the number of observations is too small to draw conclusions.",
    "Since the results using the PDII specification lead to similar conclusions to the ones we obtain using the O*NET one, we only discuss the latter because it provides a greater disaggregation of skill groups (5 vs. 3"
