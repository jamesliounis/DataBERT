    "The relative densities of Ferruginous Hawks in the United States and southern Canada, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data (Sauer and others, 2014) , are shown in figure N1 (not all geographic places mentioned in report are shown on figure) .",
    "Wallace and others (2016) examined the effect of minimum and maximum daily temperature, total daily precipitation, and number of June days with severe storm events on daily nest survival rate and fledgling productivity.",

    "[n.d.] in Friedmann, 1929; Shaffer and others, 2019) .",
    "In another North Dakota study, Gaines (1985) reported that Ferruginous Hawks preferred to nest in areas dominated by pastures and hayland.",
    "Estimates of home-range size ranged from 3.14 to 8.09 square kilometers (km 2 ) in the Columbia River Basin and Great Basin regions of the Western United States Janes, 1985; Olendorff, 1993) .",
    "Vyas and others (2017) compared the foraging preferences of Ferruginous Hawks on the poisoned colonies compared to an adjacent, unpoisoned colony.",
    "In a continent-wide survey, three Ferruginous Hawks were determined to have been killed by pesticide abuse (use of a pesticide outside of its approved application) (Mineau and others, 1999) .",
    "In a Wyoming study, daily nest survival rate and fledgling production were greater for nests on anthropogenic structures (that is, artificial nest platforms, gas condensation tanks, abandoned windmill platforms, power poles) than on natural substrates (that is, trees, cliffs, rock outcrops) (Wallace and others, 2016) .",
    "However, betweenyear re-use of nest sites was lower in the high-intensity area than in the low-intensity area and lower than in other parts of the species' range.",
    "Nest reoccupancy may be affected by nest success; in Manitoba, 52 percent of 71 successful nests were reused compared to 14 percent of 63 unsuccessful nests (De Smet, 1992) .",
    "Artificial nest platforms are an effective tool for improving breeding success where loss of natural nest substrates has occurred (Wallace and others, 2016; Ng and others, 2017; Wiggins and others, 2017) .",
    "They use native and tame grasslands, pastures, hayland, cropland, deserts, riparian areas, irrigated agriculture, and shrubsteppe (Stewart, 1975; Woffinden, 1975; Powers and Craig, 1976; Fitzner, and others, 1977; Blair, 1978; Wakeley, 1978; Johnsgard, 1979; Lardy, 1980; Schmidt, 1981; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Green and Morrison, 1983; Konrad and Gilmer, 1986; Kimsey and Conley, 1988; MacLaren and others, 1988; Roth and Marzluff, 1989; Bechard and others, 1990; Black, 1992; Niemuth, 1992; Faanes and Lingle, 1995; Houston, 1995; Zelenak and Rotella, 1997; Leary and others, 1998; McConnell and others, 2008; Ng and others, 2017) .",
    "In eastern Colorado, nests in remote locations had greater productivity than nests in more accessible locations (Olendorff, 1973) .",
    "In Oregon, Janes (1985) determined that the highest abundances of major prey species (white-tailed jackrabbits, Townsend's ground squirrels, and northern pocket gophers [Thomomys talpoides]) occurred in native grasslands.",
    "In California, Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, the species preferred areas that had few perches; mean percentage of home ranges with no perches was 77.3 percent of 50 pairs (Janes, 1985) .",
    "The average home-range size for Ferruginous Hawks was 90.3 km 2 in Washington, and the variability in home range was significantly related to distance from the nest to the nearest irrigated agricultural field (Leary and others, 1998) .",
    "In Wyoming, elevated nests were used in consecutive years more often than were ground nests (Phillips and Beske, 1990) .",
    "Beston and others (2016) identified the Ferruginous Hawk as a species most likely to experience population declines from wind facilities, based on a prioritization system that included metrics of turbine risk.",
    "Hawks may nest on anthropogenic structures, such as artificial nest platforms and electrical transmission towers (Coates and others, 2014) .",
    "White and Thurow (1985) recommended creating a disturbance-free buffer zone of 0.25 km around nest sites, whereas Olendorff (1993) suggested buffer zones of 0.25 km for brief disturbances, 0.5 km for intermittent activities, 0.8 km for prolonged activities, and at least 1 km for construction or similar activities.",
    "Ferruginous Hawk densities and productivity are closely associated with cycles of prey abundance (Woffinden, 1975; Powers and Craig, 1976; Smith and Murphy, 1978; Smith and others, 1981; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Houston and Bechard, 1984; White and Thurow, 1985; Schmutz, 1989 Schmutz, , 1991a Schmutz and Hungle, 1989; Poulin and others, 2001; Schmutz and others, 2008; Ng and others, 2017) .",
    "When converting land from sagebrush steppe to grassland, Ferruginous Hawks will benefit from the creation of a mosaic of treated (chained or disked) and untreated areas (Howard and Wolfe, 1976) .",
    "In Nebraska, the number of fledglings produced in unfragmented rangeland was not significantly different from the number of fledglings produced in a mixture of rangeland and cropland (Podany, 1996) .",
    "Likewise, Keeley and Bechard (2011) reported increased nest defense with consecutive human visits to nesting Ferruginous Hawks in New Mexico.",
    "In another Utah study, nest sites occurred near cover that was suitable for black-tailed jackrabbits (Woffinden, 1975) .",
    "Landscapes with moderate coverage (less than [<] 50 percent) of cropland and hayland are used for nesting and foraging (Blair, 1978; Wakeley, 1978; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Konrad and Gilmer, 1986; Schmutz, 1989 Schmutz, , 1991a Bechard and others, 1990; Faanes and Lingle, 1995; Leary and others, 1998) , although near the edges of the breeding range, the species occupies nesting territories that are predominantly cropland (De Smet and Conrad, 1991) .",
    "In western North Dakota, density of nesting pairs and fledging success did not differ between areas of high intensity oil and gas extraction (for example, 1,273 new wells over a 3-year period) compared to low-intensity areas (for example, 18 new wells) (Wiggins and others, 2017) .",
    "Coates and others (2014) also suggested that when changes to and loss of the natural sagebrush community from anthropogenic alterations become high enough, Red-tailed Hawks and Ferruginous Hawks may begin to nest on artificial structures such as transmission lines, signaling the deterioration of natural habitat and the need for mitigating measures.",
    "Furthermore, Common Ravens and Red-tailed Hawks were more likely to nest in fragmented shrubsteppe areas (that is, areas that were near agriculture or close to habitat edges) than Ferruginous Hawks, which preferred more-contiguous sagebrush cover distant from vegetation, roads, and energy facilities (Coates and others, 2014) .",
    "In areas where energy development has significantly altered the landscape, several authors have recommended mitigation measures, including erecting artificial nest structures to provide alternative nesting sites and minimizing energy-related disturbances until 45 days after young have fledged (Konrad and Gilmer, 1986; Ng and others 2017; Wiggins and others, 2017) .",
    "In Washington, Idaho, and Utah, several studies revealed that nests were <10 m above the ground in western juniper or Utah juniper trees (Howard, 1975; Woffinden, 1975; Howard and Wolfe, 1976; Powers and Craig, 1976; Fitzner and others, 1977; Smith and Murphy, 1978; Woffinden and Murphy, 1983; Hansen, 1994) .",
    "Keeley and others (2016) examined the difference in Ferruginous Hawk diet between rural and exurban (that is, semi-rural land use characterized by low housing density of more than 2 ha per housing unit) grasslands in New Mexico.",
    "In South Dakota, Ferruginous Hawks preferentially placed ground nests in lightly grazed pastures or idle areas (Lokemoen and Duebbert, 1976; Blair, 1978; Blair and Schitoskey, 1982) .",
    "Kolar and Bechard (2016) cautioned that a high density of wind turbines near Ferruginous Hawk nesting habitat could lower reproductive success.",
    "Tree-nesting Ferruginous Hawks seem to be less sensitive to surrounding land use, but they still avoid areas of intensive agriculture or high human disturbance (Howard and Wolfe, 1976; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; Schmutz, 1984 Schmutz, , 1987 Schmutz, , 1991a Bechard and others, 1990; Hansen, 1994; Faanes and Lingle, 1995) , except perhaps where human-related disturbances increase prey abundance (Schmutz, 1989; De Smet and Conrad, 1991; Zelenak and Rotella, 1997; Keough and Conover, 2012) .",
    "The species is prone to nest abandonment, particularly during the early stages of the nesting cycle (Davy, 1930; Weston, 1968; Fitzner and others, 1977; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; White and Thurow, 1985) .",
    "In eastern Colorado, Ferruginous Hawks nested more frequently in grassland areas than in cultivated areas (Olendorff, 1973; .",
    "Conversion of grasslands to intensive cultivation has reduced the amount of preferred habitat that is available to Ferruginous Hawks and has been implicated in the population decline of the species in some areas (Schmutz, 1984; Faanes and Lingle, 1995) .",
    "When possible, Olendorff (1993) recommended applying treatments (for example, chaining, disking, plowing, or burning) during the nonnesting season to avoid direct impacts to nesting Ferruginous Hawks, their nests, and their prey during the nesting season.",
    "Sensitivity to human disturbance may be heightened in years of low prey abundance (White and Thurow, 1985) .",
    "In another Utah study, Woffinden (1975) determined that the average slope for hills on which 19 outcrop nests were placed was 43\u00b0, whereas the average slope of hills for the 16 trees harboring nests was 27\u00b0.",
    "In Idaho, Ferruginous Hawks readily nested in areas burned within the past 15 years, as well as in unburned areas (Lehman and others, 1996) .",
    "Nesting has occurred near active railroads and gravel roads (Rolfe, 1896; Gilmer and Stewart, 1983; MacLaren and others, 1988) .",
    "In Wyoming, the mean slope of 23 nest sites was 14.26 degrees (\u00b0), and the mean height of nests was 4.55 m (MacLaren and others, 1988).",
    "Territory and nest-site fidelity is common for Ferruginous Hawks, and one of several nests within a territory may be used in alternate years (Davy, 1930; Weston, 1968; Olendorff, 1973; Blair, 1978; Smith and Murphy, 1978; Roth and Marzluff, 1989; Schmutz, 1991b; De Smet, 1992; Houston, 1995) .",
    "In Alberta, nesting densities of Ferruginous Hawks increased as the percentage of cultivation on plots increased to 30 percent and then declined as the percentage of cultivation on plots continued to increase (Schmutz, 1989) .",
    "Of 46 eggs collected in North Dakota and South Dakota during a 4-year period in the 1970s, 85 percent contained residues of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), 11 percent contained residues of dieldrin, 43 percent contained residues of heptachlor epoxide, 17 percent contained residues of ocychlordane, 22 percent contained residues of hexachlorobenzene, and 15 percent contained residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (Stendell and others, 1988) .",
    "Breeding distribution of the Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis) in the United States and southern Canada, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data, 2008-12.",
    "In Idaho, a pair may require an area of up to 21.7 km 2 for hunting (Wakeley, 1978) ."
