    "Regarding the outcome, the following table is illustrative.",
    "The following table summarizes our cost findings.",
    "(Beller and Lawrence, Table 4 .7).",
    "The data available shows that the average spread measured in this way was 1.273 % for the 18 months between August 1990 and January 1992, and the monthly standard deviation of the spread was 0.242 % for that period 1 0 (Dfaz and Valdes-Prieto, 1992) .",
    "To make up for the paucity of data on quality, we attempt a description of the services offered by each one of the pension systems discussed here.",
    "This paper fails to report quality indices because of lack of data, and should be thought of as a modest stepping-stone towards that end.",
    "Because of the absence of more information about the cost structure, we will present data on the basis of the number of registered persons that paid at least one contribution in the last 12 months.",
    "Sources: Habitat (1991) up to 1990. averaging AFPs according to their number of affiliates; For September 1992, SAFP Bulletin N' 110 for September 1992 averaging AFPs according to their number of contributors in March 1992.",
    "Appendix E, pages 284 and 285 andTable XL.",
    "(EBRI, pages 164 and 425).",
    "(Trends in pensions 1992, Table 9 .16).",
    "This paper devotes substantial space to the Chilean pension system, since it appears as an attractive option in current discussions of pension reform.",
    "22 Table 2 in A. Sunden and 0.",
    "In the conclusions we discuss how to organize joint collection in a setting with multiple providers of pension services.",
    "To check our estimate of the charges on annuitants we can use information on average spreads provided by Friedman and Warshawsky (1990) .",
    "In the following table, effective covered workers are defined as registered persons that had contributed at least once in the last 12 months.",
    "In this case we apply the contribution rate to the average accounting data on charges for 1989-91, to find the amount that must be put aside while active to pay the cost of an annuity.",
    "To project total member numbers into 1988, one should consider that the time series of total participants in defined contribution plans tends to taper off, growing only 1% in 1987 over 1986 (Table 4 .1).",
    "The term structure was almost flat for the period for which we repon data 9 This is more than life expectancy at 65, because of early retzrement.",
    "We provide data below that suggests that these premium is quite similar in the United States and Chile, although average income levels in the United States is four times Chile's at current exchange rates.",
    "This table shows that-heterogeneity is substantial.",
    "The evidence for AFPs is summarized-in Table 7 in the form of two cost ratios:",
    "The following information is available: To evaluate the quality of service to members it is necessary to compare the actual returns paid to members with a benchmark that shows the returns available on voluntary investments.",
    "The low level of expenses in group annuities, which averages 3.3% of premiums is confirmed by information on the period 1942-62: First (1955) and Second editions, tables 14 and 7 respectively.",
    "For example, based on 1991 accounting data for fixed and circulating assets, the three largest Chilean pension fund managers needed an average of 4.75 dollars per contributor per year to generate a 12% annual real return on physical assets and circulating capital 2 .",
    "In this section we investigate sources of cost by disaggregating between different AFPs.",
    "Source: EBRI (1992) page 161 dividing the tomal taxable earnings of covered workers for 1990. and then inflating bv 4% to consider nominal wage growth.",
    "The result is lowest for Provida (3.54) and highest for Habitat (6.56).",
    "We define the number of \"effectively covered contributors\" as the 78% of registered persons making at least one contribution in the last 12 months 5 .",
    "Note that this is different from economies of scale, because it is likely that joint collection may be the most efficient technique regardless of the number of workers at any one employer.",
    "One study that attempted to measure employers' costs through a survey was Beveridge's for England'.",
    "30 ISSA (1990), pages 66-67.",
    "This seems to be specially true for the largest AFPs, who already enjoy to some degree the advantages of joint collection, so the savings for them are smaller.",
    "The observed spread of 1.273% per year may be compared to that reported by Friedman and Warshawsky (1990) for the US.",
    "In the Chilean -case, these have been much higher than expected, as shown in the next table, suggesting that the quality of service was very high.",
    "Their average annual levels are summarized in F.) which is the average of the system for 1990.",
    "persons that contributed at least once This was 1,078,914 members as of March 1982 and 1,099,778 as of March 1988 (including the deceased in both numbers).",
    "In the Chilean case this difference has been remarkably small, as shown in econometric work by Walker (1991) .",
    "Mitchell and Andrews (1981) using 1975 data for defined benefit multiemployer plans and a log linear cost function found a mean cost of $49.03 per participant (1990 dollars) and large economies of scale.",
    "Reporting this cost on a per contributor basis is misleading in the case of the old age and survivors' insurance because very 20 Budget document from the SSA.",
    "It also presents empirical evidence on the administrative charges in the Chilean mandatory pension system, the charges and costs of private and public pension systems in the United States, and the state-rmn pensions in Malaysia and Zambia.",
    "The following table shows the differences in cost structure for plans with more than 100 participants: In 1988 defined benefit plans with more than 100 participants managed 2.21 times more assets per covered employee than defined contribution plans, which are newer.",
    "The cost figure for pensioners must be transformed into a cost per year in active life to make an appropriate comparison with the other figures presented in this paper.",
    "If collection costs are 6.86% of reported costs for old age and survivorship (Sunden and Mitchell, 1993) , they would amount to 107.2 million US dollars in 1990, which is a negligible 82 cents per covered worker per year in 1990.",
    "For example, in a country where only x% of the work force contributes every month, and where job rotation between the covered and uncovered segment is such that all workers pass through the covered sector at least once in their working life, then we would expect the ratio of registered persons to contributors to be close to (1/x) in the steady state.",
    ": Obtained by dividing reported costs by the number of formal sector workers, which wa 360.000 in 1989 (ISSA.",
    "Individual country time series show that a substantial share of administrative costs are proportional to the number of effective covered workers served, not to the volume of funds or the level of covered wages.",
    "An important conclusion is that the charges in private annuity markets are very considerable, confirming the results of Friedman and Washawsky (1990) .",
    "For the plans that had at least 100 members, total reported cost was 796 million in 1988 (Trends in Pensions 1992, Tables A-17 and A-15).",
    "If the information in table 6 is analyzed together with that in table 4, it can be seen that the structure of commissions is misaligned with respect to the structure of costs, as most charges are proportional to wages while few costs are."
