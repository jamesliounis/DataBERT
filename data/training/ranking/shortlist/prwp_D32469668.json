    "In a global study,Dora et al.",
    "In Section 3, we introduce the data sources for our analysis.",
    "In the following tables, we present summary statistics for CAMS-3 measures and predicted values, along with sample sizes for each case.",
    "To cite one example, Table 6 reports statistics for the period 1 PM -2 PM that include daily observations for Sentinel-5P and hourly observations for CAMS-3 and Google Traffic.",
    "Section 6 discusses the relative benefits and costs of the new data sources, while Section 7 summarizes and concludes the paper.",

    "To mobilize this huge information resource, one of the authors has developed an algorithm that maps region-scale Google Traffic displays into a panel database of traffic measures for a reference grid with arbitrary cell size.",
    "This paper has assessed the potential for low-cost augmentation of ground-based air quality monitoring in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with information from more comprehensive global information sources.",
    "Appropriately mobilized and interpreted, data from such sources could elevate the state of the art in pollution research, policy analysis and implementation.",
    "In this exercise, we have assessed the potential contributions of three global information sources: the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5P, NASA's MODIS, and Google Traffic.",
    "We find very high significance for MODIS AOD, although we should note that relatively sparse observations yield many fewer degrees of freedom for the AOD case.",
    "1 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "This paper assesses the potential for low-cost augmentation of ground-based air quality monitoring in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with more comprehensive coverage from global information sources.",
    "In a rare exception, a study for the eastern United States by Kaltenbaugh (2019) finds significant correlations between ground station measures of NO2 and Sentinel-5P's tropospheric NO2 measure.",
    "Since traffic congestion is a major source of air pollution in the study area, we use Google Traffic to develop a spatial panel database of high-resolution traffic congestion measures for the Dhaka region.",
    "Columns 5-6 re-introduce the S5P NO2 measure, since nitrates from NO2 emissions are a significant source of PM2.5 (Hodan and Barnard 2004) .",
    "However, before these sources come into widespread use, empirical tests are needed to assess their operational utility, including accuracy testing against benchmarks provided by ground-based measurement.",
    "Note: The CAMS-3 columns in Table 7 differ from those in Table 6 because the comparison data samples differ.",
    "1997; Ostro 1999; Kappos et al.",
    "We test the relationship between traffic congestion and air pollution by matching hourly pollution data from CAMS-3 with hourly weather data and hourly Google Traffic congestion in the surrounding .01-degree cell (Figure 1) .",
    "Use of the three information sources does involve trade-offs in the dimensions of spatial resolution, update frequency and cost.",
    "For comparison with readings from Dhaka's CAMS-3 monitor, we have used GEE to extract two measures for the cell displayed in Figure 1 : daily averages of tropospheric column density for NO2 and an absorbing aerosol index.",
    "Such information was simply unavailable before the advent of Google Traffic, and it provides systematic evidence that can support a much finer-grained approach to traffic analysis and transport planning for the Dhaka region.",
    "The second and third columns report predicted PM2.5 and NO2 for the CAMS-3 area at mean values of the weather variables.",
    "For our econometric tests, we generate matching CAMS-3 data by computing average measures for the corresponding intervals.",
    "where ( Table 4 reports our results for PM2.5 and NO2 readings from the CAMS-3 monitor.",
    "Many studies have found that exposure to particulates is strongly associated with mortality and morbidity (Wells 1994; World Bank 1996; Cropper et al.",
    "Brickworks are another frequentlycited source of PM2.5 in the region and their emissions are undoubtedly included in the PM2.5 baseline value reported in Table 5 .",
    "To summarize, we find that Sentinel-5P, MODIS and Google Traffic all provide useful information for air pollution monitoring in the Dhaka metro region.",
    "Our first exercise tests the relationship between CAMS-3 data and measures obtained from the Sentinel-5P and MODIS satellite platforms.",
    "Columns 3-8 test the relationship between CAMS-3 PM2.5 and three satellite measures, controlling for weather variables.",
    "We focus on the comparative significance of the satellite-based estimates as indicators of ground-level PM2.5.",
    "Section 4 uses econometric modeling to test the relationships between locally-monitored air pollution and measures provided by Sentinel-5P, MODIS and Google Traffic.",
    "Columns 7-8 test the relationship between CAMS-3 PM2.5 and MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD).",
    "We summarize the overall implications of our results in Table 5 , which reports pollution predictions across the full range of traffic speeds.",
    "The ESA has provided open-source access to the Sentinel-5P database since July 2018, and the entire database is now available on Google Earth Engine (GEE) for rapid extraction of daily imagery for specific locations.",
    "Table 4 shows that all variables in the two levels equations are highly significant, while traffic speed has similar parameter estimates and high significance in the difference equations.",
    "Our data are drawn from 2,241 hourly Google Traffic images for two periods in 2019: Jan. 1 -Feb. 8 and June 15 -Sept. 28.",
    "Our exercise in matching, estimation and prediction has produced widely-varying sample sizes.",
    "where (measured at date/time t): P = Pollutant concentration measured by CAMS-3 [PM 2.5 (ug/m 3 ); NO2 (ppb)] M = Average satellite-based measure for the .01-degree cell surrounding CAMS-3 H = Average humidity (%) T = Average temperature (C) W = Average wind speed (km/hr) \u03b5 = Random error term Table 3 reports our estimation results.",
    "Overall, the evidence from Dhaka suggests that these three information sources should be viewed as complements rather than substitutes.",
    "Research on the relationship between AOD measures and ground-level particulate pollution is well-advanced.",
    "Air pollutants are monitored for the area surrounding the Darussalam (CAMS-3) station, which provides the hourly data used for this study.",
    "We also investigate the potential contribution of Google Traffic in a spatial panel estimation exercise that relates traffic congestion to outdoor air pollution in the Dhaka region.",
    "For the Google Traffic (GT) regressions, which use GT data for two periods in 2019, CAMS-3 provides observations from 1 PM, 2 PM or both for 34 days.",
    "Recent work includes applications for the United States (Lee et al.",
    "While Figure 3 provides a wealth of evidence about traffic conditions around the CAMS-3 station, we should note that this represents only one cell in a grid that covers the Dhaka metro region.",
    "Controlling for the weather variables, we obtain highlysignificant results and predictive fits that exceed the accuracy of satellite-based measures in the majority of cases.",
    "Our second exercise tests the impact of motor vehicle emissions on air pollution, using hourly data from the CAMS-3 monitor and a .01-degree square area whose centroid has the coordinates of the monitor (Figure 1) .",
    "Here we find very high significance for both level and difference estimates."
