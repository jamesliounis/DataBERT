    "Similar conclusions were reached by Nandeesha et al.",
    "Results: In the study group 91 (60.3%) cases of metabolic syndrome (MetS) were diagnosed, while in the control group 71 (46.1%) men met the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome (p = 0.018).",
    "The analysis shows a relationship\nOPEN ACCESS\nInt.",
    "Quantitative data was analyzed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests, and data measured on a dichotomous scale were analyzed using a chi-square test of independence with Yates' correction.",
    "This is in line with data from the Central Statistical Office in Poland showing a high male mortality in Poland.",
    "In the study presented in this article, statistically significant relationships between BPH and the diagnostic parameters of the metabolic syndrome were demonstrated.",
    "The results were deemed significant at p < 0.05.",
    "A similar relationship was noticed by Hammarsten et al.",
    "Epidemiological data indicate that about 25% of middle-aged people in developed countries show the symptoms of metabolic syndrome [14, 15] .",
    "We found significant statistical relationship (Table 4) between average blood plasma glucose (p = 0.0001), mean systolic (p \u2264 0.0001) and diastolic (p \u2264 0.0001) blood, total cholesterol levels (p = 0.00014), HDL p \u2264 0.0001, LDL p = 0.021, TAG 144.9 \u00b1 90.8 mg/dL in patients in study and controls group.",
    "Basic statistics included determination of the group sizes, minima, maxima, first and third quartiles, medians, quartile ranges, arithmetic means and standard deviations.",
    "Conclusions: in the study presented in this article, statistically significant relationships between BPH and the diagnostic parameters of the metabolic syndrome were demonstrated.",
    "For example, the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance is widely described in literature [21] [22] [23] .",
    "In addition, the patients filled in a questionnaire with sociodemographic data, a late-onset hypogonadism questionnaire by Morley' and a standardized International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).",
    "n-the size of the group; min-max-min, max; Q1-Q3-the first and third quartile; me (Q)-median (quartile deviation); X \u0305 \u00b1 SD-arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard deviation.",
    "MetS can be established based on parallel criteria from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) from 2001, with subsequent modification in 2004 [4] [5] [6] .",
    "Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska conceived and designed the experiments; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Marta Grabowska, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska, Marcin S\u0142ojewski performed the experiments; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter analyzed the data; Adriana J\u0119drzychowska, Zuzanna Marcinowska contributed reagents; Marta Grabowska, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska, Marcin S\u0142ojewski contributed materials and analysis tools; Aleksandra Ry\u0142, Iwona Rotter, Maria Laszczy\u0144ska wrote the paper.",
    "A study conducted on the animal model by Vignozzi et al.",
    "The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Poland is shown by population-based surveys, such as Hypertension in Poland Plus, Plus Lipid Disorders and Diabetes (NATPOL PLUS) [16] and the Multicenter Study of National Population Health (WOBASZ 1) [17] .",
    "Among the diagnostic parameters which were analyzed in our paper in the context of MetS, only abdominal circumference and HDL were significant for the risk of BPH.",
    "[70] examined Chinese men, and similar to our study they found that metabolic syndrome and low HDL levels may be considered risk factors for BPH.",
    "However, a larger group of researchers confirm the existence of a positive correlation between the volume of the prostate and factors associated with body weight.",
    "The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the Pomeranian University in Szczecin, approval number KB-0012/132/12.",
    "One of the first studies on the impact of metabolic parameters on prostatic hyperplasia was conducted by Hammarsten et al.",
    "In that study the concentration of insulin in patients with diagnosed BPH significantly correlated with ChT and TAG levels.",
    "[53] , who observed a correlation between hyperinsulinemia and increased prostate volume.",
    "Based on the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) large cohort study, Parsons [31] developed a model in which the volume of the prostate is greater by 0.41 ml with a BMI increase of 1 kg/m 2 .",
    "The concentrations of glucose were determined, as well as ChT, LDL, HDL and TAG, by spectrophotometric method using reagent kits (Biolabo, Aqua-Med, Lodz).",
    "In the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia of average abdominal circumference was 99.2 \u00b1 9.4 cm (X \u0305 \u00b1 SD).",
    "The concentrations of glucose were determined, as well as total cholesterol (ChT), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TAG), by spectrophotometric method using reagent kits.",
    "The results of our study indicate that men with benign prostatic hyperplasia eligible for surgical treatment were more likely to have MetS than men without BPH.",
    "This situation changed in 2000 following publication of the results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) [74] , showing that the use of those drugs could cause heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.",
    "Their experiment suggests that atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is one of the diagnostic indicators of MetS, has an impact on the growth of the prostate.",
    "The study showed a statistically significant relationship between the occurrence of hypertension and prostatic hyperplasia.",
    "Public Health 2015, 12\nbetween MetS in patients with BPH and concentration glucose, ChT, LDL, HDL, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.",
    "However, there are also a few reports refuting the existence of this relationship [47] [48] [49] .",
    "Another group of researchers [43] conducted a meta-analysis involving 5403 patients with prostatic hyperplasia coming from different countries, divided into those with and without metabolic syndrome.",
    "The symptoms of MetS (according to WOBASZ 1) were observed in 9.7% of men aged 20-39 years, 28.4% of men aged 40-59 years, and in 34.5% of those aged aged 60-74 [16] .",
    "Those authors studied men living in Sweden who were diagnosed with BPH, and found that people with metabolic syndrome had increased prostate volume (49 mL) than patients with BPH and with no evidence of metabolic syndrome (28.5 mL).",
    "The control group consisted of 154 patients (60.3 \u00b1 6.2) recruited from basic health care units in Szczecin.",
    "This hypothesis has been confirmed by Kleinberg et al.",
    "[60] , male Wistar rats fed a diet enriched with cholesterol (4%) and cholic acid (1%) demonstrated not only altered blood lipid levels, but were also characterized by a hyperplastic prostate.",
    "The NATPOL PLUS surveyed 2329 people over 18 years of age who had been diagnosed MetS on the basis of NCEP-ATP III criteria.",
    "[61] demonstrated that Sprague-Dawley rats that had received a high fat diet had a larger prostate gland volume and also experienced erectile dysfunction and urinary bladder hyperactivity.",
    "The conducted studies confirm the importance of carbohydrate and lipid disorders in the etiology of BPH."
