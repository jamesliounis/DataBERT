    "(See, for example, Calvo and Mendoza (2000) ).",
    "See, for example,Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000a).",
    "(See, for example, McKinnon and Pill (1997) and Dooley (1998) ).",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "See the main text for more information on how these variables are constructed.",
    "Our data set contains daily series of EMBI spreads, stock returns, interest rates, and credit ratings.",
    "As instruments, we use lagged values of the lagged dependent variable, as suggested by Anderson and Hsiao (1982) .",
    "In that paper, the author examines whether rating agencies actions anticipated the crises of the 1990s.",
    "The table reports panel estimates with robust standard errors, using the White correction for heteroskedasticity.",
    "*,**,*** indicate 10,5,1 percent level of significance respectively.",
    "Our results can be summarized as follows.",
    "In this paper, not only did we expand this exercise with updated data, but also we tested new hypotheses to have a more complete characterization on the effects of sovereign rating changes.",
    "Richards and Deddouche (1999) , using emerging market bank-level data, examine the impact of rating changes on bank stock prices, but do not find statistically significant effects.",
    "The panel regression results for the country risk are reported in The crises of the 1990s and the speed at which a crisis in one country engulfed the region and even spread around the globe have spawned a still growing literature on contagion.",
    "To have a sense of any dynamic effects that might be taking place, we use event studies.",
    "However, a correlation between the lagged dependent variable and the error term is possible.",
    "The other variables that we use in this paper, stock returns, interest rates, and credit ratings, were downloaded from Bloomberg.",
    "Section 3 presents the data.",
    "This paper complements previous research on the effects of credit ratings on financial markets in emerging economies.",
    "Table 2 reports the number of upgrades and downgrades per rating agency and Table 3 reports the number of upgrades and downgrades per country.",
    "Interestingly, the Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Kamin and von Kleist (1999) studies include data only up to 1997 (before the crises) while the Herrera and letters of credit for domestic exporters and importers, isolating the country from international capital markets.",
    "This correlation can arise if the error term is if, for example, the true original model were in levels.",
    "The event-study methodology also allows us to examine the claim that rating agencies behave procyclically, upgrading countries in good states and downgrading them in times of crises.",
    "To capture whether credit ratings have a persistent effect on the mood of investors, we rely on event-study methods commonly used in the finance literature.",
    "The two methodologies are complementary in the sense that they show different aspects of the data.",
    "First, we estimate panel regressions.",
    "In fact, our results are consistent with the findings in Reinhart (2001) .",
    "For example, Cantor and Packer (1996) and Reisen and Von Maltzan (1997) and (1999) examine the effects of rating changes of sovereign debt and find a significant effect on bond yield spreads.",
    "Our number of observations is high (about 11 thousand for bond spreads and 22 thousand for stock prices).",
    "This paper also complements the previous literature on financial market linkages.",
    "That is, this specification tries to examine whether there is a \"contagious\" effect of credit ratings.",
    "T-statistics are in parenthesis.",
    "In that case, the error term in our equations would be in first differences and correlated with the lagged endogenous variable by construction.",
    "Most of the previous research has focused on quantifying the effects of changes in ratings of a country on sovereign risk as measured by the yield spread of domestic instruments relative to developed country benchmark instruments.",
    "It also contributes to the literature on contagion and international transmission of shocks by examining the effect of domestic vulnerability, as measured by the ratings of international agencies, on the extent of international spillovers.",
    "That is, we use different coefficients, R \u03b3 , for the sensitivity to changes in U.S.",
    "This paper complements the previous research on rating agencies by also examining these possible cross-country and security-market spillover-effects of rating changes.",
    "This correlation may arise if the explanatory variables are endogenously determined.",
    "Section 2 describes the methodology.",
    "For a detailed study on how ratings are changed, seeCruces (2001).",
    "3 This \"vulnerability\" effect may, in fact, explain some conflicting results in the empirical literature that examines international transmission of shocks.",
    "With respect to understanding better the effects of ratings, there are several potential extensions to this paper.",
    "To correct for potential biased coefficients, we estimate the more complete specification, equation 5, using instrumental variables.",
    "Interestingly, regional effects seem to be stronger than those from countries6 For example,Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000a) andKaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2000) have pointed to the role of financial links and have focused on the behavior of international banks and mutual funds.Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini (2000) in contrast have focused on the role of trade links.",
    "While examining the determinants of this time-varying relationship is beyond the scope of this paper, we will now examine whether hikes in interest rates in financial centers are transmitted more strongly to vulnerable economies.",
    "Section 4 discusses the results.",
    "Appendix Table 2 shows the scale and type of ratings used by each rating agency.",
    "To perform the event studies we work with \"clean events,\" i.e.",
    "For example, if ratings are informative, it will be instructive to analyze whether sovereign ratings are more informative for less transparent countries than for more transparent countries.",
    "This last table shows that countries with currency collapses during the 1990s, such as Korea, Malaysia, Brazil, and Indonesia, were frequently re-evaluated by rating agencies."
