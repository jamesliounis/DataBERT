    "However, it is my impression that data issued in subsequent publications (notably Energy [1989] ), will support similar results.",
    "Scrutiny of these results yields the following observations:",
    "NOTE: this can perhaps be extended to 1986 (using data in TJNJ 1988, pp.",
    "A paper prepared by personnel at China's State Statistics Bureau [SSB 1988 ] reports that industrial units at the township (xiang level and above are required to submit monthly reports of GVIO at constant prices.",
    "Together with data on the parameter,it should be possible to obtain some rough quantitative idea of possible bias in the output figures arising from changes in industrial organization.?",
    "We therefore focus our attention on Panel 2 of Table 14 , in which branch energy consumption for collective industries is derived as a residual, and then combined with published data on collective sector branch output to obtain productivity figures.",
    "The most notable example of this occurs in the chemical industry, for which relevant data appear in Table 5 .",
    "The problems explored in this paper arise primarily from thea interaction between the growing complexity of industrial organization and market structure and a statistical network designed to collect information ior the pre-reform system of industrial olanning and administration.",
    "Prior to 1985, compilations of TVE data carefully specify which data are based on 1980 prices; more recent publications conspicuously omit any mention of the price base for output data pertaining to 1985 and subsequent years r [VP, 1978-85; TVP 1987; TVP 1988; TJNJ 1988, p. 294 These figures imply that village level industrial output is higher in constant than in current prices.",
    "Thus national agencies receive material prepared by provincial agencies, which in turn rely on data compiled by municipal or county authorities, who base their reports on data from local enterprises.",
    "Data in Table 6 show a rising trend for coal prices paid by electric power plants beginning as early as 1978/79.",
    "Data reproduced in Table 8 indicate that China's industries achieved very substantial gains in energy productivity during the early 1980s.",
    "Energy data for 40 branches of industry in 1980 and 1985 are reproduced in Table 12 , where I find no significant inconsistency between implied and publisned data for branch GVIO (readers should ignore the discrepancy for branch 7, which is trivial in size, and in the residual branch 40).",
    "17 We can investigate the consistency of the data for energy consumption (not shown) and energy consumption per unit of GVIO by extracting the implicit branch figures for GVIO and comparing them with GVIO data from other sources.",
    "Table 13 reports the result of calculations that collapse data for 40 state-sector branches into 15 branches and derive figures for changes in energy productivity for the 15 branches between 1980 and 1985.",

    "An extenal researcher reports that visits to Jiangsu enterprises in the xiangzenQive category do indicate extensive mixing of data in current and constant prices, with enterprise leaders finding it difficult to explain which data are based on which prices (personal communication, July 1989] .",
    "In Panel 1 of Table 14 , branch clergy consumption and branch GVIO are derived as residuals from the national totals and the state-sector figures presented above.",
    "Table 14 presents trial estimates of energy consumption and productivity change for 15 branches of collective industry during 1980/85.",
    "The objective of this paper is to describe the statistical materials and procedures that stand behind published information on the growth of industrial output, to investigate sources of bias in the official statistics, to indicate, whenever possible, the quantitative impact of these biases on repcrted output totals, and to appraise the impact of adjustments to reported output growth on measures of industral productivity..",
    "Data for the construction industry show a consistent pattern of rising building costs from the stat of annual time seIes data in 1978 [TJNJ 1988, p. 590] .",

    "These data lead to the conclusion that the annual price changes implicit in statistics of gross output value at current (CVIO) and constant (GVIO) prices probably understate changes in the sales price of coal received by the producers.",
    "Table 11 presents a recalculation of EIGVIO and of annual percentage changes in GVIO/E for 1980/85 based on published branch data for E and on information from other sources giving branch time series of GVIO.",

    "This in tumn procedures used to provide information on the calls for an analysis of possible links between growth of industrial output.",
    "This outcome draws attention to the possibility that a portion of the productivity gains repot.ed in Table 8 may be attrbutable to measurement error.",
    "The data marked 'A,\" identified as based on 1980 prices, are much smaller than the figures marked \"b,\" which appear initially without price attribution, but are also used to compile a total described as based on 1980 prices in a separate source (Agriculture 1988, p. 314 -this is a table of 1987 gross output for township and village industry by province \"at 1980 prices\"; although the line for Shanghai is blank, the national totals and data for other provinces are virtually identical with figures in TVP 1988, p. 26, which makes no mention of a price base].",
    "when comparing the levels of industrial output in 1952 and 1987, a series of chain-linked calculations is used (see Field, JEC 1986, p. 509] and the resulting time series is described as being based on \"comparable* (kmi) rather than \"constant' (bbian) prices.",
    "These data conta a number of improbable items: can we believe, for example, that energy productivity in food processing rose by 27.3 percent during 1984/85, or that energy productivity in machine-building rose by 21.1 percent in the same year?",

    "Manipulation and interpretation of data portaining to Chinese industry (which includes mining, manufacturing and utilities) requires an appreciation of important concepts and data categories used by Chinese statisticians.",

    "These data can also be used to compute the 'energy savings' arising from the presence of lower unit energy consumption coefficients in 1985 than existed in 1980.",
    "The veracity of these data, however, depend substantially on the accuracy of GVIO data for chemicals and machinery -exactly the sectors for which comparison of physical production and value data indicate the possibility of upward bias in the value totals.",
    "Nationally, the electric power industry reports a 7.5 percent drop in unit energy requirements during 1980/85 (Table 11-B) even though coal consumption per kwh for large power plants (6000 kw and above), which produce a large share of total power output, declined by only 3.6 percent during the same period (Ene gy 1986, p. xxx].",
    "Panel B uses these figures to derive annual percentage changes in energy productivity (GVIO/E, where E represents energy consumption in terms of standard coal) for 15 branches.",
    "These data show that the arithmetic average, of annual physical output growth for nine major commodities lags behind the reported growth of output value at constant prices for every year beginning with 1979/80.",
    "Under these conditions, it is entirely possible that data supposedly based on fixed 1990 prices could contain a substantial component based on (much higher) current prices.",
