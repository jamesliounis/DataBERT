  "shortlist": [
    "(2014) , SIEMENS (2017), Covello (2010) , McKinsey and Company (2014), Ridsdale et al.",
    "This was done to identify relevant studies which informed the outline of our digital literacy framework and involved performing a keyword and title search for journal articles across academic databases.",
    "From this combination of approaches, the key studies that were identified were produced by OECD (2016a), SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011), McKinsey and Company (2014), Pirzada and Khan (2013) , Ridsdale et al.",
    "The paper also explores the extent to which a G20 advisory body may inform a nationally representative data collection strategy within the context of a data collection process that is cognizant of the evolving demands of businesses and users alike.",
    "Ultimately, we found 64 possible studies (see Table 1 ), but on closer review of the studies abstracts, only a few of the papers were useful, as the context of the study was not appropriate, or the paper only narrowly defined a component of digital literacy.",
    "The results per database are presented in the table immediately below.",
    "Approach of the study\nThe approach followed in this study is to conduct a systematic review of the trends identified internationally by academics and international organisations.",
    "(Published as Global Solutions Paper) JEL C83 J20 J22 J23 J24 F63 F66 F68 I24 I25 O15 O19",
    "(2015) , the UNESCO (2011), Martin (2008) , Covello (2010) and Bawden (2008) .",
    "Studies that highlight the best practices to do so, are reviewed and critiqued.",
    "The WEF produced a white paper in 2016 discussing the needs of digital enterprises and focused on digital business models, digital operating models, digital talent and skills, and digital traction metrics (WEF, 2016) .",
    "In light of this challenge, the second phase of the literature review involved reviewing studies produced by international bodies between 2010 and 2016.",
    "When data is collected with the aims to prepare a composite digital literacy index, the relevant sets of data describing the discipline are better referred to as dimensions.",
    "Drawing on recent literature from UNESCO (2011), the SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011), Lankshear and Knobel (2008) , Greene et al.",
    "The keywords used were \"digital literacy\" and \"definition\" The additional search criteria was to limit studies between 2005 and 2016 and only include online journal articles.",
    "An important consideration is the need to ensure the data collection strategy, that informs the construction of the index, is based on representative sampling inclusive of all members of a country's population.",
    "Considering the framework for assessing digital literacy identified in Table 3 , the G20 requires a standardized data collection process to measure the levels of digital literacy across member nations informed by this framework.",
    "The consequent data collection instrument will be used to measure the progressive realization of digital literacy across the G20.",
    "From these selected studies, the core elements of digital literacy are identified and are organized into a digital literacy framework to highlight the commonalities identified by various authors.",
    "Lessons from the OECD PIAAC Survey of Adult Skills could also be referenced in drafting the approach of aligning the computer-based assessment with a paper based approach (OECD, 2016b) (see Figure 2) .",
    "The framework includes measuring information and data literacy, which it refers to as the ability to find data, information and digital content and evaluate and manage such content (Vuorikari et al.",
    "This paper assesses mechanisms to ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed using a standardized data collection framework to measure an internationally accepted digital literacy index.",
    "This is related to the individual, the organization and public contexts when operating such technologies.",
    "Table 2 summarizes the positions adopted in agencies with respect to digital skilling and the measurement of digital literacy.",
    "This is a challenge due to the lack of available and comparable data.",
    "The goal was to identify how such organisations recognise the challenges digital literacy and to further review the studies which led them to their conclusions.",
    "Each discipline is further influenced in terms of three perspectives, viz., Cognitive, Technical and Ethical in the manner the learner should use a particular tool (see Table 3 ).",
    "The G20 will need to consider the current data limitations and construct an index in line with the suggested digital literacy framework.",
    "Thus, a regular survey informed by a representative sampling exercise of the national population, could be conducted to produce nationally representative results taking into account the low levels of internet and mobile access together with the high costs of internet access in emerging economies (McKinseyandCompany, 2014), Joncas and Foy (2012) discuss the process followed in measuring international literacy via the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) data collection instruments, and in essence highlight that rigorous sampling exercises are needed across countries, to ensure their target population is estimated correctly.",
    "Given such lags, a key concern is to measure the extent of digital adoption and appropriate usage of digital tools.",
    "The need for an inclusive data collection strategy\nIn order to develop a comprehensive composite digital literacy index to measure the degree of competence amongst the population, we propose that a multidisciplinary data collection instrument is designed and administered by the G20's national research or data collection bodies (informed by a G20 oversight and advisory body).",
    "As a component of problem solving, the survey considers the adults ability to access, process, evaluate and analyse information.",
    "Whilst the survey is one of the most of advanced international assessments of digital ability, the survey does not cover many G20 developing/emerging countries due to the focus on OECD member states.",
    "One of the indicators included in the index was a measurement of the shift towards knowledge-intensive activities, which was informed by a survey of industry experts and not a representative sampling strategy of businesses across the selected countries.",
    "These case studies assist to contextualize the approach of the study in terms of the socio-economic realities found in low/middle income countries, to which this study's recommendations apply.",
    "The sampling frames were meant to represent at least 95% of the target population amongst OECD and partner countries (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2016b) .",
    "The authors contend that the digital divide also persists in conditions where ICT penetration is high, highlighting examples where new technologies or tools emerge and the population must update their skills before they are able to fully adopt and leverage the new tools available.",
    "The report further mentions that measuring ICT impact is complex and comparable statistics are limited and therefore the selection of indicators need to be refined in future (Baller et al.",
    "Importantly, the index highlighted the need for common standards to be able to compare and benchmark progress.",
    "Our interest however was to focus on studies which attempted to define digital literacy.",
    "The framework below, presents the commonalities expressed by the authors who described the sub-components to digital literacy.",
    "On the positive side, the sampling strategy aims to be representative and includes paper-based options for the non-digitally inclined respondents (see Figure 2 ).",
    "The WEF also release the Global Information Technology Report 2016 which detailed a Network Readiness Index.",
    "Goldstuck (2010) studied this phenomenon in South Africa and identified that there is generally a five year lag from getting access to digital tools till one becomes proficient in its use.",
    "For example, as discussed in an OECD (2016a) study, businesses tend to place greater significance on the technical perspective of each discipline of digital literacy.",
    "To address the skills gaps which exists and exacerbates the digital divide, this study firstly seeks to identify the core disciplines of digital literacy required in the modern digital economy.",
    "Effectiveness at synthesis and evaluation will enable the production of new content.",
    "Within the context of this study, a discipline refers to a branch of knowledge and is found to be a more appropriate term to describe the skills required.",
    "Generally these responses emanated from disadvantaged communities where large portions of the population were not engaged in formal employment (Statistics South Africa, 2015) .",
    "(2011) further highlight the need to manage the ICT facilities to which people have access."
