  "shortlist": [
    "There are five data tables (autopsy, microscopic study, inventory, genetics, and biofluids) that are used for input, visualization, and extraction of data from the NBGB, as described in the corresponding sections that follow.",
    "In this article, we describe the integrative approach of this biobank together with the different clinical centers [30] that gather clinical data, and genetic and biofluid samples and brains of wellcharacterized, longitudinally monitored patients with different NDs at UPenn (Fig.",
    "The second autopsy data table in the INDD contains the semiquantitative scores for all the areas included in the routine research diagnostic workup (Table EA2) , with fields for additional neocortical, subcortical, brainstem, and spinal cord areas.",
    "In addition, subjects who have been included in previous GWAS studies [21,e11,e12] are identified in the INDD, and a graphicuser interface is being developed to extract specific SNPs for all the subjects.",
    "The first one contains the demographic, macroscopic, and diagnostic data (Table EA1) .",
    "To offer easy access to members of the different UPenn research groups or cores, a Web-driven online database was created using Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 3 technology along with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and JavaScript for the user interface.",
    "Sampled areas are detailed in Table  EA2 ; all areas are fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin for one set of blocks, and 70% ethanol with 150 mmol NaCl for another set of blocks.",
    "Although the table fields that contain the clinical and demographic information from the different clinical centers differ, the recent integration of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center FTLD module for use in the National Institute on Aging-funded AD centers will help increase the overlap between the data gathered by this core and the AD centers.",
    "Samples from the frontotemporal degeneration and ALS centers are sent to the CNDR for processing after sampling, whereas the ADCC, the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Penn Udall Center for Parkinson's Research all process their own samples and send them already aliquoted and in sealed containers with dry ice.",
    "However, to maximize the utility of biofluid samples for the evaluation of new biomarkers, the subjects from which they were obtained must have a reliable and accurate clinical and neuropathological diagnosis.",
    "To be able to take advantage of all the new technologies and to build onto the archive of biosamples and information, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR) at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) established the Neuropathology, Biomarker, and Genetics Biobank (NBGB) as well as the Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database (INDD) to monitor biosamples and data collection.",
    "Sample information-such as source, quality, quantity, and storage location-is uploaded into the Progeny database and linked to the individual in the database.",
    "PANDORA, performed on a Sequenom MassAR-RAY instrument, includes 52 single nucleotide genetic variants selected to represent the top hits from published genomewide association studies (GWAS) and the interests of the researchers in the different cores.",
    "A more detailed description of tissue processing and storing has been described previously by CNDR investigators [39, 40] and by other groups [42] .",
    "After they meet the necessary requirements, researchers are authenticated, and different levels of data access to the tables of the databases are granted to them.",
    "The Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC), the Penn Memory Center, the Frontotemporal Degeneration Center, the ALS Center, the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Penn Udall Center for Parkinson's Research each have protocols approved by the institutional review board to recruit patients, along with their clinical data, into research studies.",
    "Moreover, the value of biobanks is greatly enhanced if they link all the multidimensional clinical and laboratory information of each case, which is accomplished, optimally, using systematic and standardized operating procedures, and in the framework of multidisciplinary teams with the support of a flexible and user-friendly database system that facilitates the sharing of information of all the teams in the network.",
    "Plasma and CSF samples are collected in the individual clinical cores as described previously [33, 34] .",
    "In summary, we have presented an integrative approach that exemplifies the multidisciplinary integration of basic, translational, and clinical research teams in a single, dynamic framework centered on the NBGB, which gathers the clinical, biomarker, and autopsy samples and information of well-characterized subjects and enables different teams to gather efficiently large and rich data sets for studies across different NDs.",
    "When a matching patient is found in the clinical databases, all the matching data fields are imported from the clinical database to the Progeny database.",
    "Therefore, the creation of AD centers and Udall Parkinson's Disease Centers in the United States, and other initiatives in Europe [e6] and Australia [e7] , is enabling researchers to access standardized, high-quality samples from patients with NDs in collaboration with clinicians.",
    "Another example of translational research is the discovery by Cohen and colleagues [49] of how tau acetylation impairs tau-microtubule interactions and promotes pathological tau aggregation, and the following study by Irwin and colleagues [41] that characterized the deposits in AD and cases of FTLD resulting from tau immunoreactive deposits.",
    "The availability of frozen and fixed sections for each case is recorded in the tissue tracking table (Table EA3 ).",
    "The INDD contains the number and type of available aliquots from each sample (CSF, plasma, or serum), day of sampling, the INDDID, sample ID, and the physical location of the samples.",
    "In addition, a new querying system based on the same online Web user interface called INQuery has been implemented for researchers to assist them with their database queries, including selecting different fields from tables and merging data automatically.",
    "Because of the labor, cost, and logistic implications associated with autopsy procedures, the NBGB selects subjects who are followed in the clinical centers, have detailed clinical information, and, in most cases, additional biofluid, neuroimaging, and genetic data/samples to be included in the brain donation program.",
    "Recently, our group proposed a model for comprehensive AD centers that would not be limited only to the study of AD but would also include the study of PD, FTLD, ALS, and vascular dementia [30] , because of their frequent overlap [14, 31] , using a multidisciplinary, patientoriented clinical and basic research strategy.",
    "This feature prevents mismatched data in two different databases and provides the genetics group access to the most upto-date clinical and neuropathological diagnoses, because these may change over time with new ND research advances.",
    "We describe a biobanking system that is a platform for discovery research at",
    "Briefly, the INDD is a relational database implemented with Microsoft SQL Server (version 2008; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).",
    "For further details on the SOPs for CSF and other biofluid collection and storage, please see the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative SOPs which are the same as those used in the CNDR.",
    "Some of these studies have defined brain deposits that characterized new subgroups of FTLD defined by TDP-43 [3] or fused in sarcoma protein pathologies [2] .",
    "However, this information is then regenerated by clinical testing performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified molecular pathology laboratory at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP).",
    "The assistant prepares and presents the specimen containers during the dissection and records the prosector's observations for later entry to the database.",
    "A genetics table with summary fields of gene sequencing results and SNP genotypes is available in the INQuery system to perform searches in combination with clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological features.",
    "The neuropathological hallmarks of these diseases are identified as a result of the study of brain and DNA samples, and biobanks enable the collection of tissue and biofluid samples to accelerate the discovery of pathological subtypes and DNA to make associations between certain pathological subtypes with specific genetic abnormalities [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",
    "Sample receipt and testing are tracked using the workflow module of a custom-designed Progeny Laboratory Information Management System relational database (version 8.2.06; Progeny Software, LLC, South Bend, IN).",
    "In addition, biosamples are available to outside investigators (for complete details, see [e23] ).",
    "These findings have been followed by a clinical and neuropathological characterization.",
    "Tissue and DNA samples stored in biobanks [20-22,e5] have enabled these discoveries.",
    "For the routine diagnostic procedure, the sections detailed in Table EA2 are stained with hematoxylin-eosin to quantify neuron loss and gliosis, and the following primary antibodies are used for the detection of abnormal proteins: nab228 (monoclonal antibody [mAb], 1:8000, generated in CNDR) [43] to detect amyloid deposits and for Thal staging [44] , phosphorylated tau PHF-1 (mAb, 1:1000, a gift from Dr. Peter Davies) to detect phosphorylated tau deposits, pS409/410 (mAb, 1:500, a gift from Dr. Manuela Neumann) to detect phosphorylated TDP-43 deposits [3] , and Syn303 (mAb, 1:16,000, generated in the CNDR) to detect the presence of pathological conformation of a-synuclein [45] .",
    "The framework that has been established during the past two decades in the NBGB has enabled researchers to pursue a large number of diverse studies that address NDs from different approaches.",
    "Also, for every studied area there is a string field to note any additional comments.",
    "The autopsy-related information is contained in two tables in the INDD.",
    "Most of the fields included in this table are drop-down menus to avoid typing errors or the use of nonstandardized categories.",
    "Although the different clinical centers have used their own identifiers (IDs) historically, each subject in the database has been assigned a unique universal anonymized ID (IN-DDID).",
    "All the generated data are exported into Excel format for further research use.",
    "Users have to undergo Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training and be included in the corresponding institutional review board-approved protocols to gain access to the database.",
    "In addition, we describe the different basic research, translational, and clinical studies that are developed in this framework.",
    "Moreover, positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography can detect the dopaminergic deficit even at premotor stages of PD [17] , and amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging correlates with fibrillar amyloid brain deposits [18,e3] ."
