    "The sample for the current study consists of 611 men and women who underwent a comprehensive physical examination and health history assessment during their clinical visit and subsequently wore the Actiheart activity monitor for a minimum of 3 days between August 2007 and January 2011.",
    "To preliminarily explore age-related differences in activity patterns, the sample was divided into four data-driven (equally sized) age strata: <60 years old (group 1, 142 participants), 60-67 years old (group 2, 147 participants), 68-74 years old (group 3, 157 participants), and \u226575 years old (group 4, 165 participants).",
    "Second, this study uses cross-sectional data to estimate age-related differences and it is not clear whether the developed metrics are sensitive to change over time, warranting further testing in longitudinal analyses.",
    "Participant characteristics by age group are detailed in Table 1 .",
    "A general description of the sample and enrollment procedures and criteria has been previously reported (9) .",
    "Actiheart data was downloaded using commercial software (Actilife, version 4.0.32) to derive activity counts per minute.",
    "This allows for superior visualization and exploration of the association between age and activity, while minimizing the loss of information that results from using activity cutpoints.",
    "To provide contextual validity to these measures, we tested the hypothesis that common age-related comorbidities and employment status may alter these metrics.",
    "predictor of activity (\u03b2 = \u22120.037, p < .001).",
    "This study examined the relationship between daily activity and age, accounting for mobility, employment, and common age-related health factors, using cumulative activity counts and median counts per minute.",
    "Faster individuals were significantly more active than the slower individuals across all groups (p = .01, Table 4 ).",
    "Stage one modeled the relationship between age and log cumulative activity counts and revealed a significant negative association (\u03b2 = \u22120.021, p < .001) ( Table 2 , Model 1), with an estimated 2% relative loss of activity counts for each increased year of age.",
    "There was large variability across age groups, with standard deviations ranging from 49.2% in group 1 to 74.2% of the median activity count in the group 3.",
    "Those who were employed tended to be more active, but the difference was only significant in group 1 (p < .01, Table 3 ).",
    "This methodology is an essential step in assessing and understanding the true amount of activity performed by relatively sedentary sectors of the population and may clarify the level of physical activity needed for preventative purposes in future longitudinal studies involving physical activity, comorbidities, and aging.",
    "To further explore the relationship between employment and daily activity counts, each group was stratified by employment status (employed/not employed): group 1 (115/27 participants), group 2 (88/59 participants), group 3 (61/96 participants), group 4, (23/142 participants) and a two group t test was used to formally test for differences in the log of cumulative daily activity counts by employment status.",
    "A similar analysis was performed to explore the association between functional status and daily activity counts.",
    "Based on these plots, the relationship between age and total daily activity counts was explored for: (i) linearity (Figure 2A) , and (ii) shape (normality) of the distribution ( Figure 2B ).",
    "Previous research exploring the association between aging and activity has traditionally been limited to smaller samples, subjective assessment methods, or driven by activity-defined cutpoints (2, 6, (16) (17) (18) .",
    "Further, the large amount of heterogeneity and skewness in the activity intensity curves (Figure 2A-D) indicates that using cutpoints and means to define the data rather than robust approaches, such as medians and quantiles, may lead to spurious results.",
    "Finally, stage three included covariates for demographics, functional status (gait speed), and history of comorbidities including: race, years of education, current employment status, cognitive status, history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and anemia.",
    "Each age group was stratified by median gait speed (1.14 m/s, faster/slower): group 1 (102/40 participants), group 2 (96/51 participants), group 3 (67/90 participants), group 4 (37/128 participants), and a two group t test was used to formally test for differences in the log of cumulative daily activity counts by gait speed.",
    "Thus, total daily activity counts were log transformed ( Figure 2C and  D) , which resulted in a distribution much closer to normal ( Figure 2D ) and a reduction in heteroscedasticity around the regression line ( Figure 2C ).",
    "Current employment (\u03b2 = 0.150, p < .001) and faster gait speed (\u03b2 = 0.619, p < .001) were independently associated with greater activity, and history of stroke was associated with less activity (\u03b2 = \u22120.230, p = .005).",
    "Formal tests of the difference in activity counts between the youngest (group 1) and the oldest age groups (group 4) were insignificant at 8 am (t test: p = .13), but were highly significant at 9 am (t test: p < .001), 12 pm (t test = p < .001), and 6 pm (t test = p < .001).",
    "As demonstrated in the fully adjusted analysis, those who were employed were more active.",
    "Figure 1 shows the smoothed activity counts per minute ( Figure 1A ) and cumulatively per day ( Figure 1B ) for each participant in the stratified groups: group 1 (green), group 2 (red), group 3 (blue), group 4 (orange).",
    "In [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] , the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey used accelerometers to measure activity in persons over the age of 6, including 1,260 individuals aged 60 and older (6) and found that older adults spent only 6-10 min/d in activities of moderate or greater intensity with the rest of the time spent in either a sedentary state or low-intensity activity (6) .",
    "Through minute-by-minute analyses of accelerometry data in a relatively large population, this study demonstrated that the amount of physical activity in daily life is progressively lower with age and follows a different daily pattern in older compared with younger individuals.",
    "Although these limitations may be minimized in younger, healthier populations, use of these tools in older populations may be problematic, as older individuals spend most of their time in light activities generally not categorized as \"physical activity\" and in whom cognitive impairments may contribute to imprecise recall (7) .",
    "As demonstrated in the stratified subgroup analysis, the positive effect of employment was strongest in the youngest age group.",
    "Stage two introduced sex and BMI as covariates ( Table 2 , Model 2), and revealed BMI as a significant negative and independent Notes: Model 1 shows the beta-coefficient and p value from a simple linear regression model assessing the relationship between age and the log of cumulative daily activity counts.",
    "Although the proportions of men (50.4%) and women over the entire sample were similar, there were significant differences by age group, with more men in the oldest group.",
    "Health conditions were generally more prevalent in the older age groups, especially history of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and anemia (Table 1) .",
    "Two essential steps in this process are (i) obtaining accurate and reliable measures of physical activity using minimally invasive measurement tools and (ii) applying appropriate analytic techniques to optimize both the quality of the data and the extraction of information.",
    "Based on these analyses, the continuous relationship between log activity counts and age was modeled using three multiple linear regression models with increased levels of adjustment for sex, body mass index (BMI), functional status (gait speed), employment status, race, education, and comorbidities.",
    "Although part of the association may be explained by retirement, after adjusting for employment status, the strength of the association between age and physical activity was only partially reduced.",
    "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a study of normative human aging, established in 1958 and conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program.",
    "Variables for race, education, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and anemia were not significant and not included in the final model.",
    "First, due to the demands of attending a 3-day clinic visit, the study population is healthier than the general population, particularly the oldest participants, and may underestimate the true yearly age-related reduction in daily activity.",
    "Longitudinal analyses of the employment-activity relationship are warranted, specifically to determine if employment into the later years of life attenuates the decline in activity among those who remain employed.",
    "Although traditional subjective activity measurement tools may be easily administered and are generally inexpensive, they provide broad estimates of easily recalled activities of mostly medium-to-high intensity (8) .",
    "In Figure 2A , the red line represents an unadjusted linear regression fit and the blue line represents a smooth nonparametric fit.",
    "This study has several potential limitations.",
    "Two-timed trials were conducted to derive usual gait speed in m/s, with the faster used for analysis.",
    "In the fully adjusted model, the estimated relative loss of activity counts for each increased year of age was 1.3%, compared with 2.0% in the unadjusted model.",
    "Age, education, employment status, and history of chronic conditions were derived from a health history interview conducted by a nurse practitioner.",
    "Model 2 expands upon model 1 by adding sex and body mass index to the model.",
    "To evaluate daily activity patterns, unadjusted median activity counts per minute were also assessed over the same 24-hour period ( Figure 1A) .",
    "The importance of employment in maintaining daily activity is consistent with previous work in 20-60-year olds in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (15) and confirms the idea that having consistent employment is an important driver of physical activity in middleaged and older individuals."
