    "In this section we provide the details of the data used in this study and the empirical methods employed.",
    "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
    "The individual level data (approximately 650,000 usable observations) are generated through surveys which enabled the production of stratified samples, drawn from the data which correspond to the whole working age population in each participating country.",
    "We use the International Monetary Fund's Government Finance Statistics (GFS) database that contains government spending data comparable across countries.",
    "This result is consistent with previous studies which have found a similar relationship (Wennekers et al., 2005; Aidis et al., 2012) .",
    "The GFS database has the largest degree of coverage in comparison to similar data sets such as EUROSTAT or the Asian Development Bank that tend to be region specific.",
    "We use the available data from the GEM data which are consistent and comparable across time.",
    "To achieve this we combine cross-country microeconomic individual level data with country-specific government spending data from the IMF's Government Financial Statistics database (GFS).",
    "The benchmark estimation result is provided in column 2 of table 3 where we now include the composition of government spending -the share of spending on social and public goods.",
    "Our estimation results are presented in tables 3 and 4.",
    "We then describe the individual level data set, and finish the section off with a description of our empirical approach.",
    "Combined with the government spending variables the sample spans from 2001 to 2009 covering 50 individual countries for a total of around 650,000 observations.",
    "(2005) and is already available in the GEM data set.",
    "These data are generated through stratified samples of 2,000 individuals surveyed per country.",
    "We adopt the econometric model used by Estrin and Mickiewicz (2011) .",
    "In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) This is the first study to our knowledge that examines the relationship between the composition of government spending on public goods and entrepreneurship.",
    "However, some insightful findings can be gleaned from the results.",
    "This study set out to go one step farther than existing studies by exploring the composition of government spending in addition to total government spending, the latter having received a significant amount of attention in the literature.",
    "They credit this insignificant result to multicollinearity between the constraints to executive measure and GDP per capita.",
    "In this study we expand on the latter hypothesis.",
    "This estimation model has been found to be a better fit for the GEM data set than country effects as the data set is highly imbalanced with countries appearing once or twice.",
    "Results for most of the control variables are consistent with findings in the literature.",
    "However the coefficient does gain significance at higher lags of the spending variables, giving some support for the \"prosperity-pull\" hypothesis.",
    "Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 present the conceptual model, data and methods, results, and conclusions, respectively.",
    "While our findings are fairly positive towards the engagement of the government in certain sectors, we also draw attention to the limitations of the policy implications that can be gleaned from this study.",
    "In column 1 of table 3 we present the results with only total government spending so as to replicate the typical relationship found between total government spending and entrepreneurial activity in the literature.",
    "We include several individual level controls from the GEM data set and macroeconomic controls from the World Bank Development Indicators (WDI).",
    "As stated earlier, we use the random country-year effects probit model.",
    "We follow the literature in controlling for macroeconomic measures of development and institutions.",
    "It is important to note the large drop in the number of observations for the infrastructure spending estimation results and therefore the findings should be taken with a grain of salt.",
    "A key feature of this literature has been the size of government -specifically the size of government spending -which several studies have found to have a negative relationship with entrepreneurship (see Aidis et al., 2012 for a review of the literature).",
    "In summary, our individual level controls establish findings that several other studies have found.",
    "There is a theoretical literature on government subsidies and entrepreneurial activity (see Li, 2002 for a review).",
    "The coefficient is consistently negative and significant at the 1% level throughout columns 2 through 6 in table 3.",
    "The base empirical model is as follows: Where i denotes individuals, j denotes country, and t denotes time.",
    "Using data and empirical models employed in the literature we confirm several results found by existing studies including the negative relationship between total government size and entrepreneurial activity.",
    "Returning to our benchmark estimation result in column 2 of table 3, we find that current owners or manager of business, as well as those who have been business angels in the past are more likely to start new businesses (Minniti et al., 2005; Mickiewicz, 2005; Aidis et al., 2012) .",
    "We control for personal characteristics such as education, age, gender, employment status, experience, and networks (Parker 2009) .",
    "Typically disaggregated categories are more prone to measurement error, and in some disaggregated categories have missing informationinfrastructure spending being a prime example where we see a significant drop in the number of observations.",
    "A natural extension to the results would be to explore whether more disaggregated subcategories of social and public goods have similar effects on entrepreneurship as the aggregate measure.",
    "A word of caution applies to the following results.",
    "This is also repeated in column 1 of table 4",
    "Of course there may be interrelationships within the social and public good spending components making them more effective when they are lumped together as a group.",
    "Thus in table 4 columns 3 to 4 we substitute the share of social and public goods with a more detailed component of the spending variable.",
    "The focus on country-years rather than countries is also appropriate as it fits the logic of the GEM sampling methodology (Estrin and Mickiewicz, 2011) .",
    "Thus in table 3, from columns 3 to 6, we increase the lag of the spending variables by one year.",
    "Our analysis exploits the GEM database, which covers 50 developed and developing economies between 2001 and 2009 and which includes all startups, regardless of their legal status.",
    "We use a probit model with random country-year effects in all our estimations.",
    "We use individual controls that have been established in the literature as significant determinants of entrepreneurial activity.",
    "We posit that this finding may be consistent with findings from the growth, fiscal policy, and credit market imperfections literature."
