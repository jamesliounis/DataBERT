  "shortlist": [
    "The results are presented in Table 1 and 2.",
    "To illustrate this point, I will give some data from a brief empirical example.",
    "I used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey or BBS (Robbins et al.",
    "1983 , Williams 1995 , Lomolino 2000 , 2002 , Lomolino and Weiser 2001 , Williamson et al.",
    "Rosenzweig examined these z-values and noticed that in fact z-values were strongly correlated with the temporal scale of the processes involved in creating the SPAR.",
    "The results are presented in Table 3 .",
    "For example, Rosenzweig (1995) has made considerable progress by combining techniques one and three and examining different temporal scales over which parameters show a regular pattern.",
    "This includes some of the most famous of all macroecological patterns: the power-law (S=cA z ) species area relationship (SPAR), the hollow curve distribution of species abundances (SAD), and the skewed-lognormal distribution of body size (BSD) .",
    "Hilborn and Mangel 1997) .",
    "Other arguments suggests that the Poisson (the law of rare events, Taylor and Karlin 1998) and the power law (which fits a wide variety of data as demonstrated in point 2) are also common null hypotheses.",
    "Number of times each distribution was the best fit for various measures.",
    "found in distribution of human incomes or the sizes of cities) and come from CLT-like arguments (Montroll and Shlesinger 1982) .",
    "But Connor and McCoy (1979) noticed that the z-values have a much larger range, from about 0.05 to about 1.0.",
    "Kolmogorov -Smirnov statistic -when using the Kolmogoro -Smirnov it is usually important to apply a Lilliefors type correction (1967), since the parameters are usually estimated from the data.",
    "In a similar spirit, Cohen (1968) derived two biological models of SADs which produce a broken stick distribution (MacArthur 1957",
    "Monte Carlo and repeated samples -if we generate many repetitions either through random simulation methods or from many datasets (e.g.",
    "Finally, I tried fitting two different functional forms (power law, Michaelis -Menton) to this noisy data, and calculated a mean-corrected non-linear r 2 .",
    "In short, tests based on curve fitting can be made reasonably rigorous if we use existing statistical machinery.",
    "For example, the abundances in species abundance distributions (SADs) have been found to often remain constant over large spatial and temporal scales (McGowan and Walker 1985 , Lawton and Gaston 1989 , Ebeling et al.",
    "Over two-dozen different distributions have been suggested for the SAD (Pielou 1977 , Tokeshi 1993 .",
    "The goodness of the fit depends heavily on where Table 2 .",
    "From this he deduced that the power coefficient (z-value) of the SPAR should be about 0.26.",
    "Level 3) The curve fits the data better than the appropriate null hypothesis by some objective measure.",
    "In addition, most macroecologists are familiar with the fact that by simple properties of the logarithm, the CLT predicts that when many variables interact multiplicatively, we should find a lognormal distribution (McAlister 1879 , MacArthur 1960 , May 1975 .",
    "This can be shown analytically (West and Shlesinger 1989) and graphically (Fig.",
    "Pielou noted this in the context of SADs (1977, p. 123) .",
    "1996 , Hadly and Maurer 2001 .",
    "where most of the probability density is).",
    "1987 , West and Shlesinger 1989 , Dewdney 2000 , Allen et al.",
    "For example, various correlations or the precise value of certain measurements might be predicted as well.",
    "We have already seen that a commonly appropriate null hypothesis is the POLO.",
    "The probability density function (PDF) for the power distribution and low-to high-variance lognormal distributions.",
    "I generated data from five different underlying functions: power law (S =cA z ), logarithm (S = log(c+zA), two with an asymptote (Michaelis -Menton and Ivlev) and one sigmoidal (logistic).",
    "1999 , Dewdney 2000 , Hubbell 2001 ).",
    "Hence, I will refer to these distributions collectively as POLO (power lognormal) throughout the remainder of this paper.",
    "Most biologists know that the central limit theorem (CLT) of statistics (Grimmett and Stirzaker 1992) states that we should find normal distributions any time many variables interact additively.",
    "In the rest of this paper, I will first try to demonstrate that testing exclusively by curve fitting is very weak and a poor way for macroecology to proceed in the search for mechanisms.",
    "This suggests it will be hard to come up with rigorous scientific tests based on the concept of ''best fit to the data.''",
    "He suggested that SADs follow a very specific form of the lognormal curve which he called the canonical distribution.",
    "Of course, we could start imagining that arrival and preemption occur on a very large spatial scale, but this is a good example of the utility of looking at spatial and temporal scales.",
    "First, recall our context of testing mechanisms by producing theories containing mechanisms which match the data.",
    "There are also deep CLT-like statistical reasons for why we might find a power distribution ( Simon 1955 , Mandelbrot 1963 , Bak et al.",
    "I then compared the goodness of fit using 9 different measures: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, likelihood, three based on different measures comparing the actual and observed CDF using various nonlinear versions of r 2 (Wilkinson 1997) , and four based on a x 2 test using different binning schemes.",
    "lognormal distributions of abundance (Preston 1948 , Whittaker 1965 , body size Brown 1988, Brown and Nicoletto 1991) , and size of geographic range (Pagel et al.",
    "Thus, Sugihara's random fraction model of SADs (1980) converges to the lognormal (Pielou 1975) as do many others (e.g.",
    "By looking at patterns in the parameters, Rosenzweig was able to start sorting out different scales and mechanisms behind the SPARs.",
    "Rosenzweig and Abramsky (1997) points out that even the weakest prediction (a qualitative yes or no) can be part of a robust test if we have enough of them -he calls this a ''dipswitch test''.",
    "1990 , Boucot 1996 , Brett et al.",
    "The Akiake and Bayesian information criteria address these problems and also take us up to level 5 by using likelihood ratios and applying a penalty factor for using more parameters (Hilborn and Mangel 1997) .",
    "The XRange column indicates spatial extent."
