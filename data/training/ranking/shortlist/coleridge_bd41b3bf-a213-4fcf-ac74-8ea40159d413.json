  "shortlist": [
    "Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).",
    "The following data from 819 ADNI participants were downloaded from the ADNI database: all baseline 1.5 T MRI scans, the RBM (Rules-Based Medicine) multiplex proteomic analytes extracted from plasma and serum, and demographic and baseline diagnosis information.",
    "The trends for some of the identified analytes follow those in the published literature and are summarized below.",
    "We have done an integrative analysis of structural MRI data and proteomic data to examine their predictive power and identify relevant biomarkers in a large MCI/AD cohort.",
    "Table 2 Cross validation results (%): mean\u00b1SD is shown for accuracy and AUROC",
    "1) were included in this study.",
    "This work was focused on sparse linear classifiers applied to the simple concatenation of multi-modal data, since our major goal was to yield easily interpretable models while maintaining high predictive power.",
    "Although recent studies reported promising prediction rates by integrating these multi-modal data [7, 10, 16] , few were focused on identifying a small set of disease relevant biomarkers [13] to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying mechanisms associated with complex disorders.",
    "This study focuses on integrative analysis of structural MRI data and proteomic data from an RBM panel to examine their predictive power and identify relevant biomarkers in a large MCI/AD cohort.",
    "These experiments were applied to three data sets: (1) FreeSurfer data (98 variables), (2) RBM data (146 variables), and (3) combined FreeSurfer and RBM data (244 variables, a simple concatenation of the two modalities).",
    "Using a similar RBM panel and methodology as done by the ADNI study, O'Bryant et al.",
    "The imaging and proteomic biomarker data was analyzed using the implementation of elastic net logistic regression provided in the Matlab package glmnet.",
    "Replication in independent large samples will be important to confirm these findings.",
    "Further information can be found in [15] and at www.adni-info.org.",
    "Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 .",
    "Note that Panels (e,f) selected a smaller number of FreeSurfer features even though the overall prediction accuracies of all three analyses were comparably high.",
    "Table 2 summarizes the 5-fold cross-validation results for classifying HC vs AD, HC vs MCI, and MCI vs AD for each combination of six methods (SVM 10 , SVM 25 , SVM, EN25, EN50 and EN75) and three data sets (FreeSurfer, RBM, combined FreeSurfer and RBM).",
    "Our overarching goal is to construct from multimodal data sparse models which combine ease of interpretation with high predictive power.",
    "551 out of 819 participants (57 healthy control (HC), 388 MCI, 106 AD participants) had both FreeSurfer and RBM data available.",
    "For one baseline scan of each participant, FreeSurfer V4 was employed to automatically label cortical and subcortical tissue classes [3, 4] and to extract target region volume and cortical thickness, as well as to extract total intracranial volume (ICV).",
    "A linear support vector machine coupled with feature selection was employed for comparison.",
    "(3) While FreeSurfer data performed slightly better in classifying HC vs AD than RBM data, the latter had surprisingly greater power to distinguish MCI from HC (87.4%) and AD (83.7%).",
    "With these observations, this paper has the following aims: (1) investigate the predictive power of a new set of proteomic analytes from an RBM panel, (2) study whether or not combining structural MRI and proteomic data can enhance prediction rates, and (3) employ a principled sparse learning method, elastic net logistic regression [5] , in the study to maximize prediction accuracy while optimizing the selection of disease sensitive biomarkers.",
    "While SVM 10 and SVM 25 identified a few relevant markers similar to EN50, they also yielded some questionable blue blocks and the selected features varied a lot among di3erent cross-validation trials.",
    "This is consistent with previous studies showing reduced or elevated concentrations of specific analytes in plasma or serum samples of AD participants.",
    "Using the regression weights derived from the healthy participants, all the FreeSurfer measures were adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education, handedness, and ICV, and all the RBM proteomic measures were adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education and handedness.",
    "These results are very encouraging in the following sense: (1) Elastic net classifiers outperformed SVMs in terms of overall accuracy and area under ROC (AUROC) in almost all the cases, while the performances of EN25, EN50 and EN75 did not di3er significantly (paired samples test on AUROC p > 0.06 in all cases).",
    "1-3 ) only for the combined set analysis, since single modality analyses yielded similar maps.",
    "Let y i \u2208 {0, 1} denote the class membership of the ith observation and let X i denote the corresponding vector of p classification variables.",
    "To have a balanced data set among di3erent diagnostic groups, we included all HC and AD participants and a randomly selected set of 110 (out of 388) MCI participants in this study.",
    "MRI data included volume and thickness measures of 98 regions estimated by FreeSurfer.",
    "ADNI is a landmark investigation sponsored by the NIH and industrial partners designed to collect longitudinal neuroimaging, biological and clinical information from over 800 participants that will track the neural correlates of memory loss from an early stage.",
    "The sparse models generated by elastic net identified a small set of meaningful imaging and proteomic biomarkers and were much easier to interpret than SVM-based models.",
    "identified the analytes alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2Macro), eotaxin 3 (Eotaxin 3) and pancreatic polypeptide (PPP) to be over expressed in the serum of AD participants relative to controls [11] similar to the current findings.",
    "These analytes may play a role in disease pathology and warrant further investigation in independent samples.",
    "A sparse learning model, elastic net logistic regression, was proposed to classify AD and MCI, and select disease-relevant biomarkers.",
    "The results may provide important information about potential surrogate biomarkers for therapeutic trials.",
    "For a fair comparison, a linear support vector machine (SVM) [14] coupled with a widely used feature selection scheme (SVM-based Recursive Feature Elimination, or SVM-RFE [6] ) was applied in this study.",
    "Although SVM 10 and SVM 25 (see (a-b)) were able to identify a few interesting features, the selected features varied a lot among di3erent crossvalidation trials.",
    "(2) The best prediction rates using FreeSurfer were 86.6% for HC vs AD and 74.3% for HC vs MCI, comparable with the most recent studies using MRI as predictors [7, 13, 16] .",
    "Elastic net logistic regression uses the standard logistic regression model for the dependence of Y on X:\nHowever, in order to produce sparse classification weight vectors, it estimates \u03b2 by the maximizer of the penalized logistic regression log likelihood function in which is the elastic net penalty.",
    "1(d-f) compare selected features in di3erent classification tasks using EN50.",
    "Elastic net seeks to reduce the number of nonzero weights so that only relevant features contribute to the discriminative value.",
    "An initial analysis of applying SVM with a radial basis function kernel to the same data yielded comparable or less accurate results, and these nonlinear models were much harder to interpret.",
    "An interesting future topic is to investigate whether these nonlinear models can help improve the prediction rates as well as derive biologically meaningful results.",
    "Its application to multimodal imaging and biomarker data has considerable potential for discovering biomarkers and enhancing mechanistic understanding of AD and MCI.",
    "Its application to multi-modal imaging and biomarker data has considerable potential for discovering biomarkers and enhancing mechanistic understanding of AD and MCI.",
    "Multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), studied independently or coupled with other biomarker data (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuropsychological assessments), have been shown to be sensitive to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, thought to be the prodromal stage of AD).",
    "Elastic net identified a small set of meaningful imaging and proteomic biomarkers.",
    "Weights for classifying HC vs AD are shown in (a-d) for SVM 10 , SVM 25 , SVM and EN50 respectively."
