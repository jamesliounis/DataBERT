    "A similar result was found by Chattopadhyay and Du \u2021o(2004b) In Table 10 we examine the e\u00a4ect of individual characteristics on the likelihood of a decision being reached with regards to one's preferred topic.",
    "The sample was selected from seven districts in the four South Indian states, The district and block sampling is less relevant for this paper and is described in more detail in Besley et.",
    "In a related paper, using the same transcript data, we have found that in villages where the position of Gram Panchayat president is reserved for women, women to tend to talk more during the village meetings (Ban and Rao 2008b) .",
    "Besley, Pande, and Rao(2005a) , using the same household level data from our paper, study the determinants of participation in village meetings.",
    "There is a large literature on processes that aggregate individual preferences -particularly on voting behaviors, but the literature on deliberative processes is relatively sparse: Osborne, Rosenthal, and Turner(2000) study participation in meetings from a theoretical perspective.",
    "In Table 3 we present the summaries of topic measures overall and for each partition.",
    "In November 2001 we conducted a survey at the village and household level to study various aspects of GPs in South India employing a sampling methodology described in detail in the next section.",
    "They use data from deliberative polls, and measure individuals' preferences before and after the deliberation.",
    "List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean(2006) \u2026nd evidence for the e\u00a4ect of deliberation on preferences.",
    "In Table 2 we present summaries for the occurrence and the fraction of lines dedicated to each of these partitions.",
    "Turner and Weninger(2005) do an empirical test of this theoretical model using data on the participation of \u2026rms in public regulatory meetings.",
    "There is some evidence analyzing the match between the preferences of individuals and the outcomes of commmunity-based decisions, a process known in that literature as \"preferencetargetting\"(Mansuri and Rao 2004).",
    "We present the results in Table 11 .",
    "and the match intensity is de\u2026ned as: Table 6 presents the summaries of the match indicator and match intensity.",
    "First (columns (1) and 2 Next, we look at the e\u00a4ect of political reservations (columns (3) and (4)).",
    "Our data consisting of transcripts of open village meetings, gram sabhas, empowered by the Indian constitution to make important decisions for the village, linked with household-level preferences, enable us to examine the relationship between individual preferences and the preferences that emerge during deliberations.",
    "Using these partitions, we are able to more accurately pinpoint the source of these e\u00a4ects.",
    "In Table 9 we decompose the discussion by the gender of the speaker.",
    "The two methods yield very similar results, and in the paper we will base our results on the keyword-searched topics.",
    "For each paragraph the topics mentioned were recorded via two methods: First, topics were manually coded, by reading every transcript and noting the topics mentioned in each paragraph.",
    "Where g are village level \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, t are preference \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, and X ig is the matrix of individual and household level variables described in Table   3 .",
    "To estimate this e\u00a4ect, we include in our regression an interaction 16 term between the characteristic of interest and landownership.",
    "In column (2) the dependent variable is the match-intensity.",
    "Having found that the preferences of the landed class are more likely to be mentioned and take up more time in the meeting, we also want to investigate whether any village level characteristics accentuate or mitigate this e\u00a4ect.",
    "In the transcripts we were also able to identify instances where decisions regarding the provision or maintenance of public goods were taken.",
    "2 0 However, we have evidence that the topics of discussion in the gram sabha are related to subsequent public goods outcomes.",
    "The list of keywords is available upon request.7 The gender of the speaker was not identi\u2026ed in 10% of the discussions, including one full transcript.8 For example, the occurence measure for water in o\u00a2 cials'talk equals 1 if water is a topic in a paragraph spoken by an o\u00a2 cial and 0 otherwise.",
    "In Table 2 we present the summaries of the di\u00a4erent transcript partitions.",
    "In this paper we use data extracted from transcripts of village meetings, coupled with household surveys, to empirically explore the mechanism of deliberation.",
    "In estimating the relationship between discussion about roads and improvement we control for initial road quality, a wide range of village level variables, and block \u2026xed e\u00a4ects.",
    "Having reviewed the types of preferences expressed by individuals, we move on to analyzing how often these preferences are mentioned during village meetings.",
    "Table 7 presents the results of the ordinary least squares estimation of (1) and (2).",
    "We have also tested the hypothesis that in women reserved or caste reserved constituencies, the women and the members of the lower castes are more likely to have their priorities mentioned.",
    "Previous research has demonstrated that reservations can alter the nature of decisons made by panchayats(Besley et al.2004b, Chattopadhyay and Du \u2021o2004a 2004b.",
    "We use a unique dataset of transcripts of gram sabhas (village meetings) in South India to learn about the process of deliberation.",
    "In a separate paper (2004a) they \u2026nd that SCST presidents invest in public goods preferred by SCSTs, a result that is also found by Besley, Pande, Rahman, and Rao(2004a) .",
    "Finally, in columns (5) and (6) we look at the in \u2021uence of the presence of the BDO in the meetings.",
    "Second, to ensure the replicability of our \u2026ndings, we coded the topics by keyword searches 6 .",
    "These matched topics are then studied both as indicators, and in their level of intensity, to understand the types of households who are more likely to have their preferences discussed in the gram sabha.",
    "Table 6 presents the summary of preference matching.",
    "We de\u2026ne two measures for each topic: the occurrence of the topic, as a dummy variable, and the intensity of the topic.",
    "Using the transcript data from the \u2026rst round, to limit the potential for reverse causality, we \u2026nd that villages where discussion about roads dominate the gram sabha also experience a greater improvement in the quality of roads between 2001 and 2005.",
    "Chattopadhaya and Du \u2021o2004b examine the role of political reservations for women on the match between women's preferences and the decisions of gram panchayats, Rao and Ibanez2005 and Labonne and Chase2007 study the match between preferences of households and the outcomes of commity-based decision making showing some elite dominance.3 Also see the Fung and Wright2003 edited volume that has several case-studies of deliberative decision making.",
    "Decomposing the caste e\u00a4ect, we observe that the advantage of SCSTs is driven by an increased preference match likelihood within o\u00a2 cials' talk, which is not paralleled in the villagers' talk.",
    "In order to study gram sabha deliberations we bring together two di\u00a4erent sources of information.",
    "In the appendix we provide a couple of examples of decisions.",
    "By matching proceedings within transcripts of gram sabhas with the preferences of villagers we are able to see whose voices are heard, whose priorities are mentioned, and how institutions a\u00a4ect deliberative dominance by elites.",
    "Second, by employing preference \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, we control for any unobserved characteristics speci\u2026c to individuals who hold a given preference.",
    "Hence, we can partition the transcripts based on the hierarchical position of the speaker (o\u00a2 cial or villager), the gender 7 of the speaker, and on whether the paragraph contains a decision (for or against).",
