    "2005) and was used in this study.",
    "2002; Vernon-Feagans and Cox 2013) .",
    "These indices were chosen because of the need to use replicate weights for the analysis, as indicated by ECLS-B researchers.",
    "Since this study constitutes secondary data analysis of the ECLS-B's first two rounds of data collection, all the measures used were selected from the ECLS-B study.",
    "As seen in Table 1 , the total number of children in the ECLS-B is about 10,700, but only the children of mothers considered \"working mothers\" by the first round of data collection at 9 months were included in this study.",
    "Furthermore, path analysis was chosen, because it assesses the relationships among measured variables, which is the case of the variables in the present study (Chou and Bentler 1995) .",
    "The present study analyzed data from the first two waves of data collection and collected when children turned 9 months and 2 years of age.",
    "1994; McLoyd 1998; Repetti et al.",
    "2010; Gregory and Rimm-Kaufman 2008) .",
    "These scores are traditionally obtained by researchers using the AQS following the guidelines of Waters and Deane (1985) .",
    "All analyses were conducted through path models in Mplus which allows for the use of sampling weights, adjusts for complex sample designs, and includes procedures for handling missing data (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n 2006 ).",
    "When the data are analyzed using these weights, the results are representative of all children born in the U.S. in the year 2001 (Nord et al.",
    "The TAS-45 was used by several large-scale studies.",
    "For example, Raikes et al.",
    "The maximum-likelihood method has shown to be a state-of-the-art technique for dealing with missing data, highly recommended by researchers (Schafer and Graham 2002) , and is robust to nonnormality in structural equation modeling (Enders 2001).",
    "This study consisted of secondary data analysis of the ECLS-B collected when the children were 9 months and 2 years of age.",
    "Figure 2 illustrates the direct significant paths found, and Table 3 presents the decomposition of effects.",
    "The model was tested using standardized coefficients obtained with maximum-likelihood method of estimation.",
    "Similarly, this procedure was recommended by researchers comparing it to other replication methods when testing them using the same data set (Stapleton 2008) .",
    "This measure was used to identify the sample of working mothers included in the study.",
    "Selecting cases with a valid value of W2C0 for working mothers yielded a sample size of approximately 3850.",
    "For example, the TAS-45 was used to examine the associations between food security during infancy and subsequent attachment behaviors in toddlerhood and the associations between attachment security and child obesity (Anderson and Whitaker 2011; Zaslow et al.",
    "Effect sizes need to be interpreted in context; effects sizes in similar studies such as the child care studies were all considered small (McCarthney and Rosenthal 2000) .",
    "The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 .",
    "This measure was adapted from the Attachment Q-Sort developed by Waters and Deane (1985) .",
    "Yet, some limitations stem from the use of secondary data analysis as some variables of interest, such as maternal individual preferences, were not included in the survey.",
    "Extensive research has supported the association between socio-economic status and mother-child interactions (e.g., Belsky and Jaffee 2015; Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997; Grolnick et al.",
    "This study addresses these gaps in the literature using a nationally representative sample of U.S. children with longitudinal data to examine the possible effects, both direct and indirect, of the length of maternity leave on mother-child interactions and on attachment security.",
    "Using Hu and Bentler's (1999) specifications, two fit indices were used to determine model fit, including the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Square Residual (SRMR).",
    "1982; Sumner and Spietz 1994) .",
    "It is based upon a linear equation system, and is used mainly in the attempt to understand comparative strengths of direct and indirect relationships among a set of variables (Chou and Bentler 1995) .",
    "Path analysis is a subset of SEM (Ullman and Bentler 2003) , and is used to examine relationships between two or more variables.",
    "A meta-analysis of 66 studies and 4000 families found that maternal sensitivity in mother-child interactions was highly correlated with secure attachment (De Wolff and van IJzendoorn 1997) .",
    "The findings of the present study support what has been argued by many developmentalists (e.g., Belsky 2001; Zigler and Hall 2000) , namely that the ability to spend time with a child before the return to work might help a mother develop higher levels of attunement to her child's needs or higher levels of sensitivity towards her child's cues without the stress of separation.",
    "2002; Hart and Risley 1995; Klebanov et al.",
    "According to Hu and Bentler's specifications (1999) , models with RMSEA higher than .10 have poor fits, models lower than .10 are considered adequate, and models of .05 or lower are considered to have good fit.",
    "In this way, path analysis is an appropriate answer to our research questions, since in path analysis, mediated pathways or indirect effects can be examined (Ullman and Bentler 2003) .",
    "An important limitation of the present study is the issue of causality.",
    "Children were sampled by occurrence of birth within a set of primary sampling units defined by counties or county groups.",
    "The three hypotheses of the study proposing direct and indirect effects of length of maternity leave on attachment were estimated by path analysis of the analytical model presented in Fig.",
    "This study controlled for infant gender, birth order, employment location (in or out of the home), breastfeeding, and maternal education.",
    "Since SES is related to the length of maternity leave (Human Rights Watch 2011; Kamerman 2000) , this study included maternal SES as a variable in the models.",
    "The dyad total score had a reliability of .72 (Andreassen et al.",
    "1978), which is a laboratory-based procedure, and the Attachment Q-Sort (AQS; Waters and Deane 1985) , which was developed as an alternative to the Strange Situation.",
    "This procedure was recommended by ECLS-B researchers as an effective way of calculating path coefficients.",
    "One of the main findings of this study was that length of maternity leave had a direct effect on the quality of mother-child interactions.",
    "The present study had three goals.",
    "In addition, ECLS-B weights W2C1-W2C90 adjusted for nonparticipation, so the results are applicable to the original sample.",
    "The results bring new light on an enduring research issue, namely the relationship between non-maternal child care in the months of life and attachment.",
    "Following the approach of Kenny (2009), the presence of significant indirect effects in path models was considered a mediation effect."
