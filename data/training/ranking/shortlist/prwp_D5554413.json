    "Obtaining and analyzing data on this range of parameters is a major challenge for researchers and will require investments in data collection and analysis.",
    "6 See Jalan and Ravallion 1997;Hentschel and others 1998;Wilcox 1999;Bigman and Fofack 2000; IFPRI 2000; de Janvry 2002; de Janvry and others 2002;Demombynes and others 2002; Davis 2002.",
    "There is an overview article by Reardon, Berdegue, and Escobar (2001) , and country studies on Nicaragua (Corral and Reardon 2001) , El Salvador (Ruben and van den Berg 2001) , and Honduras (Lanjouw 2001) .",
    "12 Also see World Bank 2000; Attanasio and Szekeley 2001; Wadsworth 2002; Winters and others 2002) .",
    "More attention is being devoted in the development literature to multi-dimensional economic, social and environmental measures of well-being (Moser 1998; Carney and others 1999; Coudouel and Hentschel 2000; Narayan and others 2000) .",
    "Specifically, it is suggested to undertake the following analyses: descriptive statistical and graphical analyses of the distribution of assets and incomes among households, GIStype mapping techniques along with some simple regressions of spatial relationships, quantitative household analyses, participatory qualitative analyses of assets and livelihoods, and participatory qualitative assessments of existing CA ESSD projects.",
    "7 To date, much of the focus on mapping efforts and spatial analyses for Central Americahas centered on identifying ecological zones and environmentally sensitive areas (see WorldBank and CCAD 2001; Vreugdenhil and others 2002).",
    "See, for example, a recent study of Nicaragua's agricultural sector (WorldBank, 2002d) in which an entire chapter was devoted to agricultural risks and risk management strategies.",
    "As will be noted in this paper, the asset base approach has much in common with a livelihoods approach.",
    "This requires additional types of data and analysis.Box 2.11 Well-Being and AssetsThe 2003 World Development Report states: \"Greater productivity and prosperity depend on improvement of many dimensions of well-being -both material wealth and the nonmaterial aspects of personal and social welfare.",
    "For example, the pervasiveness of rural poverty in the Central American countries and the location of poor rural households is largely the result of historical factors (see for example, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2000; Attanasio and Szekeley 2001; Morley 2001; Franko 2003; Plataforma Agraria 2003; World Bank 2002c) .",
    "The asset-based approach can be used to explore relationships between: assets, context, behavior, outcomes (see de Janvry and Sadoulet (2001)).",
    "This paper provides an explanation of the asset-based conceptual framework, including a review of the literature.",
    "13 Notwithstanding the forward-looking character of this study, it is also critical that the historical context not be ignored.",
    "As noted by Narayan and Pritchett (1997) , poverty analyses that focus exclusively on tangible household assets miss a large part of the \"poverty puzzle\", by ignoring the community and social context.",
    "Note: country case studies were carried out for Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras applying the asset-based approach for the Study \"Identifying Drivers of Sustainable Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction\" during 2002 to 2004.",
    "There are plans to prepare Policy Research Working Papers for the respective country case studies.",
    "See Varangis and others 2003 for some examples of payments for environmental services in coffee growing areas in Central America Box 1.3 Sectoral and Spatial Linkages Start (2001) points out that besides the obvious production and consumption linkages, there are other important sectoral (agricultural and non-agricultural) and spatial (rural-urban) links that have a major impact on economic performance.",
    "It is suggested to combine quantitative and qualitative spatial and household level analyses (and linked spatial and household level analyses) to deepen understanding of the complex relationships between assets, context, livelihood strategies and well-being outcomes.",
    "There are disappointingly few success stories(Richards and others 2002, p.10).\"",
    "A considerable body of development literature that praises the diversification of livelihood strategies of poor rural households, implying that diversification can increase incomes and/or reduce risks (Ellis 1998 ).",
    "A household's assets consist of the stock of productive, social, and locational resources used to generate well-being (see Moser 1998; Siegel and Alwang 1999; Rakodi 1999 ; Carney and others 1999; de Janvry and Sadoulet 2001).",
    "The study, \"Identifying Drivers of Sustainable Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction,\" is part of ongoing efforts by the Central American Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development (CA ESSD) Department in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Region of the World Bank to strengthen analyses and strategies for rural development, and to address fundamental policy issues and investment priorities.",
    "In fact, there is evidence that past diversification initiatives in Central America have been biased toward higher-potential areas and households with stronger asset bases (Tabora 1992) .",
    "Explaining why the poor are poor in Central America, Valdes and Mistiaen (2001, p.12 ) cite another study that states: \"Most basically it is because they have few assets (both human and physical, including social capital) and also because the productivity of their assets is low.",
    "It also leads us to use both quantitative and qualitative analyses to better understand the complex relationships between assets-context-behavior-outcomes.",
    "Non money-metric approaches can be found, but usually the indicators are tied back to the concept of poverty using a money-metric baseline (Glewwe and van der Gaag 1988) .",
    "Because of these factors, it is important to examine levels and changes in well-being along the entire distribution of rural households; including poor and non-poor households (Alwang and others 2002) .",
    "A recent ODI Briefing Paper on \"Options for Rural Poverty Reduction in Central America\" states: \"The main hope for agriculture as an engine of growth may lie with diversification.",
    "18 Note: There is a special issue of the journal World Development, Volume 29, No.",
    "In many cases, agro-ecological zones are also highly correlated with other assets at the household, community and regional levels (see table 2 ).",
    "For example, access to high-quality land has different implications for well-being depending on its location relative to markets and other infrastructure or on access to credit and high-quality inputs.",
    "7 See table 1 for highlights of the World Bank's new rural development strategy for Central America.",
    "The asset-based approach underlies the livelihoods approach (Carney and others 1999) and has increasingly been advocated by numerous development agencies including IADB, USAID, FAO, IFAD, DFID, CARE, and the Ford Foundation.",
    "Thus, the context is determined by a wide array of policies and public investments, and the overall efficiency, equity, and transparency of their design and execution.",
    "One reason is that data for tangible assets are more easily collected and available.",
    "An asset-based approach has been adopted to guide the conceptual and analytical framework used for this study, whereby household assets are considered the \"drivers\" of growth.",
    "While these changes may have led to some improvements in well-being and reductions in rural poverty rates, the region is still characterized by persistent and stark inequalities in assets and incomes and high numbers of poor persons (Tejo 2000; Morley 2001; Sauma, 2002; Franko 2003; de Ferranti and others 2004) .",
    "The 2003 World Development Report focuses on the role of institutions, and it also highlights the strong linkages between assets and institutions.",
    "To a large extent, the context is shaped by factors external (or outside the control) of households.",
    "This requires improved geographic analyses that consider the heterogeneity of areas and households within areas.",
    "This inequality is most evident in terms of landholdings, but other key productive, social and locational assets are also unequally distributed among households and geographical areas (Attanasio and Szekeley 2001; de Janvry 2002) .",
    "It has been estimated that about 50% or more of rural households' income in the Central American countries come from rural non-farm employment (RNFE) (Berdegue and others 2001; Reardon and Berdegue 2002; Corral and Reardon 2001) .",
    "Furthermore, important links between policies and risks exist, because policies and investments can either increase risk and exposure to risk, or help households better manage risk and vulnerability to poverty (Siegel and Alwang 1999; Anderson 2001; Varangis and others 2002; Siegel and others 2003) .",
    "In addition, the location (e.g., proximity or distance) of infrastructure is considered to be a critical asset, because it influences the availability and accessibility (e.g., transaction costs) of goods and services (van de Walle 2000a; 2000b) .",
    "Valdes and Mistiaen (2001) claim that: \"This taxonomy helps in guiding the analysis of rural poverty determinants by distinguishing those factors that contribute or constrain the building of the assets of the poor (education, demographics, land, and others) from those influencing the productivity of such assets (the incentive framework, financial policies, overall economic growth, and others).",
    "It is important to examine the relative contributions of these assets, and identify the combinations of productive, social, and location-specific assets that help poor households take advantage of prospects for poverty-reducing growth.",
    "Since income and consumption are more easily measured and generally correlate well to other indicators of well-being, they tend to be the primary indicators used, especially in the quantitative analyses.",
    "Migration has been an important strategy for many rural poor in Central America, accounting for much of the reduction in rural poverty during the 1990s(de Janvry and Sadoulet, 2001)."
