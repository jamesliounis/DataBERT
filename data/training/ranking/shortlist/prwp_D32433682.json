    "The paper proceeds as follows.",
    "Our paper shows some of the promise and limits of doing so.",
    "This paper contributes to two main literatures.",
    "Section 2 describes our sample, the context, the intervention and the data.",
    "However, this table can also be interpreted as evidence for over-reporting WTP as in Hoffmann (2018) .",
    "More work is needed with much larger samples to enable measurement of the heterogeneity of returns to training with willingness-to-pay, following the procedure we have outlined in this paper.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Column (1) shows the mean and standard deviation for the control group of the BDM sample.",
    "Table 5 presents the results from regressing elicited WTP in the BDM sample on observable characteristics measured at the baseline survey.",
    "Columns (2)-(4) show the coefficient of an OLS regression of each covariate on an indicator for the respective treatment, and the associated standard error.",
    "See Appendix B for details on the construction of these variables.26 The only result that survives to adjusting the p-values for the fact that we are testing 8 hypotheses in this",
    "Table 10 then combines this cost data with the impact of prices on demand (measured here as attending at least one training session) in order to determine the cost of training 1,000 firms at different prices.",
    "See, for example, the article in The Economist (2018) reporting a state of emergency in regions of the country where most of our first sample operates.",
    "Column (10) presents results from a pooled regression including both samples.",
    "We rely on three sources of data: baseline data, administrative data on payment and attendance, and follow-up data.",
    "In Table 8 , we then test for selection effects by studying how WTP correlates with attendance, before examining the causal effect of prices on attendance.",
    "We obtain family-wise adjusted p-values using the implementation by Jones et al.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Column (1) shows the mean and standard deviation for the control group of the TIOLI sample.",
    "Column (5) shows the p-value of a test of equality across the three treatment arms Credit: respondent was allowed to pay in 3 installments, Discount Frame: respondent was presented the price as a discount, a share from the cost of the course.",
    "* p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 Table 5 .",
    "Detailed results are available upon request.",
    "Finally, Columns (6) and (7) present the correlates for paying for the course in the TIOLI sample.",
    "Columns (1) and (3) show the mean and standard deviation for the BDM sample and TIOLI sample, respectively.",
    "The first row of Table 7 presents detailed summary statistics by price offered.",
    "Demographic and business characteristics of the two samples are provided in Table 1 .",
    "A short baseline survey was conducted on the phone or online upon enrollment in the study to provide basic background on the firm, including characteristics that can be used to examine what factors help predict willingness to pay.",
    "These results are consistent with many of the experiments surveyed by McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) , which find business training improves business practices, but that it is harder to measure impacts on business performance in smaller samples.",
    "Recent examples include Ben Yishay et al.",
    "Due to its simplicity, it has been widely used to inform the debate on the pricing of health products (See Dupas and Miguel (2017) for a recent survey).",
    "We regress attendance on a flexible set of willingness to pay dummies, and then use the residuals from this regression, adding back the sample mean to enable comparability with the raw pattern.23 As we can see in Column (1) ofTable 9, 90 percent of those offered the course for free attend at least one class, this share increases to 97 percent for those paying J$5,000 (marginally statistically significant difference) and to 99.5 percent for those paying J$10,000 or J$15,000 (statistically significant).",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 .8 1 Share that paid full price 0 1,000 3,000 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 Price in J$ BDM sample TIOLI sample Columns (1) and (3) show the mean and standard deviation among those who attended demo sessions for the BDM sample and TIOLI sample, respectively.",
    "23 This means that while the evidence for sunk-cost effects is more nuanced for the TIOLI sample, these effects seem to be present also in this sample.",
    "*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 OLS regression.",
    "Credit: respondent was allowed to pay in 3 installments Regressions in column (2) also include fixed effects for demonstration session.",
    "Table A1 compares the characteristics of those who enter into the demand study by attending the demonstration sessions to those who did the baseline survey by phone, but then did not attend any demonstration sessions.",
    "We first conduct the analysis using the full sample.",
    "Columns (2) through (6) then examine different potential determinants of demand.",
    "Regressions in column (5) also include fixed effects for demonstration session.",
    "As Table 7 shows, training attendance was much higher in the TIOLI sample than in the BDM sample, consistent with the fact that entrepreneurs in the TIOLI sample have higher WTP for the course.",
    "Column (5) shows the coefficient of an OLS regression of each covariate on an indicator for the TIOLI sample, and the resulting standard error.",
    "Column (2) shows the coefficient of an OLS regression of each covariate on an indicator for treatment.",
    "Columns (1)-(6) present results for the BDM sample, and Columns (7)-(9) for the TIOLI sample.",
    "27 After adjusting the p-values for multiple hypotheses, the p-value for this coefficient becomes 0.043.",
    "First, the logistical difficulties implementing BDM resulted in a smaller than desired sample size, more participants assigned to treatment than control, and lower take-up of training, all of which reduce statistical power.",
    "Sample sizes in the existing literature have been insufficient to draw reliable inferences on which firms benefit most from training (McKenzie, 2020) , and our sample sizes and attrition rates likewise prevent us from measuring accurately heterogeneity in treatment effects by willingness to pay.",
    "Regressions in Columns 1-5 control for week and location of demonstration sessions when the WTP was elicited.",
    "Regressions in column (4) also include fixed effects for demonstration session.",
    "The second literature this paper contributes to is one on methods to estimate the demand for products or services.",
    "Our elicited WTP is positively correlated with the baseline WTP completed in the phone survey, but the coefficient is small and only marginally significantly different from zerothis might be because they did not have enough information about the course to gauge WTP without the demonstration session, or because they were trying to answer strategically, and not truthfully, when asked WTP in the phone survey.",
