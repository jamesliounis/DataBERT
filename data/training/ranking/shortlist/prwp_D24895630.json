    "(2013) which are publicly available.",
    "In our empirical analysis, we use a panel framework covering 46 countries over the period 1996-2012 to formally investigate the questions above.",
    "As data are available only for selected years, we also rely on time-series constructed by Duval et al.",
    "The period of analysis and sample size are determined by the availability of value-added trade data from the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database used to assess the role of GVC integration.",
    "The choice of the period of analysis and sample of countries is determined by the availability of data on trade in value added from the OECD-WTO TiVA database used to undertake the main analysis in Section III.",
    "Specifically, the first row in Table 4 presents the same results as in Table 1 but for a shorter time series and less countries due to data availability.",
    "(2014) interpolating the OECD-WTO data in some of our regressions.",
    "Unless otherwise stated, the data sources and country coverage are given in the Appendix.",
    "(3) and (4) of the second panel of Table 2 .",
    "The regression framework is based on the approach in the cross-country literature discussed in the Introduction, notably Freund and Pierola (2012) and Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) .",
    "As discussed in the literature, there are also benefits to estimating regressions with data averaged for five-year periods: lag structure becomes less important, outliers are less of a concern because they are averaged out, and,",
    "Specifically, we use value-added exports data from the OECD-WTO TiVA database to build measures of GVC participation, backward and forward linkages, and GVC position for each country and, when available, for each manufacturing subsectors, from 1996 to 2012, using the definition provided in the previous subsection.",
    "(2014) provide a further elaboration and present a more complex diagram.",
    "1996-2012 1996-2003 2004-2012 1996-2012 1996-2003 2004-2012 1996-2012 Note: *** indicates statistically significant 1%, ** indicates statistically significant at 5%, and * indicates statistically significant at 10%.",
    "As common to this literature, results also tend to be sensitive to the methodology through which real export series are obtained from nominal values.",
    "Our results confirm in a cross section the recent findings by Amiti et al.",
    "A recent literature has developed measures of REER that correct for GVC participation, generally defined as value-added REER Johnosn, 2012, and Bayoumi et al., 2013) .",
    "Using this framework, we run regressions on 46 countries for the period 1996-2012.",
    "In the second line of Table 4 , we regress value-added exports on the standard REER.",
    "In our regressions, we use the measures developed byBayoumi et al.",
    "The computed point estimates are consistent with previous results: The average GVC participation of 36.05 in the five-year average sample of the second panel of Table 2 predicts an elasticity of -1.06 14 , in line with the elasticity estimated in column (1) of Table 2 .",
    "In the last two rows, instead of using the standard REER and gross exports, we regress value-added exports on two measures of the REER corrected for GVC participation taken from Bayoumi et al.",
    "This paper addresses these questions in two steps.",
    "See IMF (2013) for a discussion and comparison of the different approaches used in the literature to obtain REER in value-added terms.Patel et al.",
    "(2010) in using this decomposition to obtain several measures of integration in GVCs at the country-sector level.",
    "These results are consistent with previous work and contribute to the literature on the impact of exchange rates on export growth by showing in a cross section that the nature of trade, i.e.",
    "Table 2 shows that, in line with our hypothesis, higher participation in GVCs is related to lower elasticity of manufacturing exports to REER.",
    "Section III focuses on the role of integration in GVCs and contains the main finding of the paper and a number of robustness tests.",
    "(2014) using disaggregated data for Belgian firms that the impact of a depreciation on export volumes is lower for exporters with higher import shares.",
    "Second, we can exploit the information on GVC integration at the sectoral and sub-sectoral level from the TiVA database in the analysis of next section.",
    "Specifically, column (3) of Table 2 shows that the elasticity of manufacturing exports to the REER does not change with GVC position in the first panel with annual data but it is more negative the higher the position in GVCs in the case of the fiveyear averages in the second panel.",
    "Importantly, the finding that GVC participation reduces REER elasticity is quite robust and continues to hold when we use industry-level data which are less likely to suffer from endogeneity problems.",
    "If we take the slope estimated for the REER in the first line of column (2) of the second panel ofTable 2, -1.75, and, then correct it using the positive estimated slope on the interaction term for participation in GVCs, 0.019, and the average participation in GVCs, 36.05, we have -1.75+0.019x36.05 = -1.06.",
    "5 We estimate the regressions with standard errors clustered across cross-section (White cross-section covariance method).",
    "There are a number of reasons why these findings are relevant and more work in this area would be welcome.",
    "In the second panel of Table 2 , we can see that a country with no participation in GVCs would have a REER elasticity of -1.75, therefore, on average, GVC participation reduces REER elasticity by approximately 40 percent (-1.75+1.06/-1.75).",
    "The empirical model allows us to formally test these ideas and identify the key transmission channels in the data.",
    "Since the underlying data used to construct GVC data is published approximately every five years, we consider five-year average time series instead of annual time series in our panel regressions as well.",
    "Similarly, Figure 4 also provides the range of the impact of GVC position and backward linkages using the estimates in columns",
    "Indeed, we show that, using measures of REER that correct for GVC participation developed in the literature Johnson, 2013, and Bayoumi et al., 2013) , we do not find the same decreasing pattern of elasticity over time.",
    "The regressions reported in this section build on Equation (1) and can be grouped in three categories.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides new evidence of the REER elasticity of total, goods and manufacturing exports, documenting its decline over time.",
    "Column (2) of Table 2 shows that countries with higher participation in GVCs present a lower exchange rate elasticity of manufacturing exports both in the first panel for annual data and the second panel with the five-year averages.",
    "Specifically, we control for initial conditions by including lagged GDP and use exportweighted GDP of the country's main trading partners which gives a sense of the demand for the country's exports in a particular year.",
    "Figure 1 focuses on a sample of Central Eastern European countries and provides some suggestive preliminary evidence to motivate our analysis.",
    "Consistently with existing firm-level studies, column (4) highlights finally, unit roots in variables are less of an issue.",
    "We use this alternative measure as a robustness test in the empirical analysis of the next subsection.",
    "(2010) as our data do not allow to capture these further complexities.",
    "Specifically, the point estimates of the elasticity are smaller and the decreasing pattern is less steep than in Table 1 ."
