    "Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) , Huang, Zhou, and Zhou (2009) , Chan-Lau and Gravelle (2005), Avesani et al.",
    "The variance ratio has been previously used by Ferreira and Gama (2005) and Bakert and Wang The second measure we use is derived from quantile regressions, which estimate the functional relationship among variables at different quantiles (Koenker and Hallock 2001) .",
    "Cross-sectional regression results are reported in Table 7 .",
    "See for instanceKarolyi, Lee and Van Dijk (2009) andBekaert and Wang (2009).",
    "A number of papers have examined the correlation structure of equity returns of a subsample of banks.",
    "This table shows the summary statistics for the distance-to-default measure for countries for which we have at least one observation.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "The first table in the appendix, Table A1 , provides an overview of the definitions and sources of these variables.",
    "The key variables for our analysis come from BANKSCOPE which provides bank-level balance sheet information, and DATASTREAM which provides information on stock prices, market capitalization and stock volume.",
    "Before examining time-series variation in co-dependence for the three measures we have outlined above, we first explore commonality in changes in default for the whole sample period.",
    "Table 2 presents the matrix of pairwise correlations across regions.",
    "In particular we are interested in whether there have been structural shifts in co-dependence over the sample period from 1998 to 2010.",
    "This table describes the country-level variables used in the analyses in this paper.",
    "Other financial studies using the quantile regression approach include Koenker and Bassett (1978) , Engle and Manganelli (2004) , and more recently Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) and Boyson, Stahel and Stulz (2010) .",
    "The results from the empirical model in equation (8) are reported in Table 6 .",
    "Finally we control for the log of the number of banks in the sample, since correlation may be mechanically linked to the number of cross-sectional observations (Morck 2000).",
    "To compute these correlations, we first calculate value-weighted changes in log default probability, , for each region and then compute correlations over the sample period.",
    "In this paper we use three complementary measures.",
    "We follow Campbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi (2008) and Hillegeist et al.",
    "In this table, we report the systematic variance attributable to global, country and size effects.",
    "In the table we also report the number of banks covered by both BANKSCOPE and DATASTREAM as well as the number of banks that remain after we impose data filters described above.",
    "Section 2 describes the data sources and describes the construction of the Merton (1974) default risk measure.",
    "The empirical model we use to test these relationships is the following:",
    "Our dependent variable is the variance ratio, , calculated for each country i for each year t. We obtain similar results using the co-movement measure or the quantile betas described in Section 3.1.",
    "We use the database created by Abiad Detragiatche and Tressel 2010 well.",
    "The data sources are provided under the \"Source\" column.",
    "Table A2 presents 7 summary statistics.",
    "Schuler (2002 find similar results for Europe using a sample from 1980 to 2001.",
    "First, our empirical analyses cast a wider net than the existing literature which focuses only in a particular region or a country and covers a shorter time period.",
    "This paper is also related to the literature that studies contagion in financial markets (see among others Forbes and Rigobon 2002, Kee-Hong Bae and Stulz 2003) and also the literature that examines the impact of globalization on convergence of asset prices (Bekeart and Wang 2009 , Longin and Solnik 1995 , Bekaert and Harvey 2000 , and Bekaert, Hodrick and Zhang 2009 .",
    "This table shows the weighted-average distance-to-default measure for 9 different regions computed each year.",
    "For each period t, we run a cross-sectional regression to estimate the coefficients, , and .",
    "The results in this paper have important policy implications.",
    "As mentioned earlier, consistent with the prior literature we find gdp per capita growth to reduce co-dependence, although the level of GDP per capita is insignificant.",
    "We obtain similar results using the co-movement measure or the quantile betas described in Section 3.1.",
    "In the next section we explain the various measures of co-dependence used in the analyses.",
    "Our paper is related to this strand of literature, but our focus is not on quantifying systemic risk of large financial institutions but rather to examine time series trends for a large cross-section of banks.",
    "Table 2 provides annual average distance-to-default measure for different regions.",
    "Hawkesby, Marsh and Stevens (2005) analyze co-movements in equity returns for a set of US and European large complex financial institutions using several statistical techniques and find a high degree of commonality.",
    "Our original data from both BankScope and Datastream covers 2,294 publicly traded banks across 86 countries.",
    "Second we examine time series trends in codependence and test for structural changes over time.",
    "This paper differs from the existing literature in three respects.",
    "The results are reported in To explore further the systematic variation in changes in bank default risk, we follow the methodology of Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) and decompose changes in default risk into three components: global effect, country effects and asset size effects.",
    "We use weekly market data and annual accounting information in creating our credit risk measure.",
    "Previous literature has shown that more developed countries tend to have lower commonality in asset prices and liquidity (see for instance Karolyi, Lee and Van Dijk 2009) .",
    ", that takes on a value of one if a country in our sample has experienced a banking crises in a given year.",
    "In this section, we examine time series variation of co-dependence in the banking sector.",
    "In this paper we examine whether the global trends described above have led to an increase in co-dependence in default risk of commercial banks around the world.",
    "The Merton (1974) distance-todefault measure has been shown to be good predictor of defaults outperforming accountingbased models (Campbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi 2008; Hillegeist, Keating, Cram, and Lundstedt, 2004; Bharath and Shumway, 2008) .",
    "Following Bakeart and Wang (2009) we use trend tests to detect potential changes in co-dependence."
