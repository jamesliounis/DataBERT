  "shortlist": [
    "This paper must be viewed as an initial step in a large research agenda.",
    "Table 6 gives the sources and definitions of variables employed in this paper.",
    "Much of the data stem from the Brazilian Population Censuses of 1991 and 2000.",
    "They divided their dataset in cohorts and used a large list of variables as determinants of growth, including microdata from PNAD -National Household Survey.",
    "Next, we describe the data and the econometric specification employed.",
    "This technique is attractive because it is computationally feasible for large numbers of observations; allows for the use of instrumental variables; and is robust to misspecification of the degree of autocorrelation among neighboring observations.",
    "The plan of the paper is as follows.",
    "(Azzoni 2001; Ferreira 1998 ; Pontual e Porto J\u00fanior 2000).",
    "Table 7 provides summary statistics for these variables.",
    "More apt for our purposes are the models applied by Fan and co-authors to India and China (see Fan, Zhang, and Zhang (2002) , Fan Hazell and Haque (2000) , Fan and Chan-Kang (2004) ).",
    "Most of these are in the tradition of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) , and are concerned with the detection of convergence in per capita income levels or growth rates across the subnational units.",
    "The regression results are in tables 8-10.",
    "Revista Econ\u00f4mica do Nordeste, Fortaleza, v.32, N.ESP., p.524-545, 2001 .",
    "Tables 1-5, and population density maps (figure 2), provide a more accurate representation of population breakdowns.",
    "Readers are again referred to the color pdf version of this paper.",
    "Both samples represent munic\u00edpio level data.",
    "We have found a number of relationships that appear to be robust to different choices of sample and different controls for spatial autocorrelation.",
    "Foi utilizado o m\u00e9todo GMM espacial desenvolvido por Conley (1999) , que permite o uso de vari\u00e1veis instrumentais na presen\u00e7a de autocorrela\u00e7\u00e3o espacial.",
    "The paper began by mapping the heterogeneity of labor market outcomes across Brazil during the 1990s.",
    "While we have data on mean years of education of the work force, we lack information on employees' educational quality.",
    "Table 6 lists the instruments for each endogenous variable.",
    "Tables 4 and 5 show also that about two-thirds of employment is in the metropolitan agglomerations.",
    "We present the results for three samples.",
    "Finally, the regression includes a few variables intended to capture the impact of local amenities on attracting and retaining labor.",
    "To be precise, they stem from the 12,5% Census sample of 1991 and 5% Census sample of 2000.",
    "A fim de elucidar essa din\u00e2mica, o presente artigo estimou um modelo espacial de demanda e oferta por trabalho no qual descreve as mudan\u00e7as no n\u00edvel de sal\u00e1rios e empregos dos munic\u00edpios.",
    "Is this a causal relationship?",
    "Consider next the impact of initial demographic and agroclimatic conditions.",
    "However, several papers find evidence that this convergence process stalled after 1985, with one or two groups of poor states tending towards a lower-income equilibrium than the richer part of Brazil.",
    "These papers seek to measure the marginal impact of government investments on income and on poverty, with particular attention to the returns to investment in less-favored areas.",
    "If confirmed, this a sobering finding from the viewpoint of reducing inter-regional inequalities.",
    "for a composite output, where K is a vector representing industrial and agricultural capital, including land); L is the number of workers; Educ is a vector measure of the quantity and quality of worker education; A is a vector of productivity shifters, which include transport connectivity to markets, local governance quality, and agroclimate.",
    "estimated traditional regressions of growth with microdata for 19 Brazilians states.",
    "Araujo, de Janvry, and Sadoulet (2004) present a munic\u00edpio-level, spatial model of employment growth in Mexico that is the closest precursor of the current paper.",
    "To address this problem, we merged munic\u00edpios into 4267 Minimum Comparable Areas (MCAs) -consisting of sets of one to three munic\u00edpios whose borders were constant over the study period.",
    "In Fan, Zhang, and Zhang (2000) , for instance, a provincial production function relates agricultural GDP per capita to land per worker, agricultural capital per worker, agroclimate, and infrastructure stock.",
    "We used Conley's spatial GMM technique to allow for instrumental variable estimation in the presence of spatially autocorrelated errors.",
    "These patterns were evident even controlling for remoteness and education, which might be correlated with rainfall.",
    "For each model we present the results for both 2SLS and spatial GMM specifications.",
    "Finally, a key issue in estimation is the likelihood of spatial autocorrelation of unobserved variables.",
    "The change in government transfer payments was statistically significant in the 2SLS and the cutoff=0.5 specifications, with coefficients of about 0.3 and 0.2 respectively.",
    "To address this issue, we use the GMM technique of Conley (1999) (as did Araujo, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2004 and Baicker 2005) .",
    "Further investigation is needed to understand the degree to which this represents 'pull' factors -attraction to growing areas, vs. 'push' factors -e.g.",
    "However, the coefficient on this variable was positive, significant and robust.",
    "This may reflect collinearity with years of education combined with nonlinearity in the relationship.",
    "As a sensitivity test, we ran the GMM regressions using different cutoffs for spatial autocorrelation: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 degrees.",
    "Other variables of interest are statistically significant in the 2SLS specification, but less so in the spatial GMMs.",
    "There is some evidence of convergence in incomes between states over the periods 1939 -1985 (Azzoni 2001 ) and 1970 -1985 (Ferreira and Diniz 1995 .",
    "A complication, however, is that some munic\u00edpios experience splits over the study period, the total number growing from 4491 to 5507.",
    "Figure 1 and tables 1-5 illustrate the geographic diversity of Brazil's labor market dynamics over the period 1991-2000, a diversity we seek to explain."
