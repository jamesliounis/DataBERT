    "(1987) and references therein.",
    "The sample consists of a total of 24,433 observations with 9,028 observations from 1976 and 15,405 from 1981.",
    "The sample size in each cross section: 11,362 in 1976, 11,882 in 1981, 10,897 in 1986, 11,046 in 1988, 13 ,177 in 1990, 13,459 in 1992, 25,208 in 1994 and 25,110 in 1996.",
    "The density is approximated by the techniques explained in Footnote 36 3The 1979 average household yearly income is estimated from the SES data.",
    "This is done with two distinct microeconomic datasets, one a series of nationally representative household surveys (SES), and the other gathered under a project directed by one of the authors, with more reliable estimates of wealth, the timing of occupation transitions, and the use of formal and informal credit.",
    "In this section we present the simulation results using the calibrated and estimated parameters from both data sets.",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "5 Note that e > \"u76, C > W8i and ( > wNE, C > wC and p >0 , a > 0 for both datasets as required in Footnote 9",
    "In related work, Paulson and Townsend (2001) estimate with the same data as here a version of the Evans and Jovanovic (1989) model allowing the mean of unobserved ability to be a linear function of wealth and education They find the magnitude of both coefficients to be small 8 .",
    "The first and primary data base is the widely used and highly regarded Socio-Economic Survey' 7 (SES) conducted by the National Statistical Office in Thailand.",
    "The data come from the Bank of Thailand as reported in Alba, Hernandez and Klingbiel (1999) .",
    "Finally we again use the SES data and the calculations of Jeong (1999) to determine the fraction of the population which has access to intermediated, credit and savings markets, i.e., that reside in the credit sector 43 .",
    "'We use the functional forms contamned in the 1993 workng paper, although the published version contains slight modifications.6 SeeGriffin et al.",
    "0 As mention earlier, when we use the Townsend-Thai data, we also search over a grid of 20 scaling factors for the mitial distribution of wealth.",
    "They use data from the the NESDB (National Economic Social Development Board) in Thailand.",
    "The second dataset is a specialized but substantial cross sectional survey conducted in Thailand in May 1997 of 2880 households 19 The sample is special in that it was restricted to two provinces in the relatively poor semi arid Northeast and two provinces in the more industrialized central corridor around Bangkok.",
    "22Paulson and Townsend (2001) provide a much more extensive discussion of the original data, the derivation of variables to match those of the LEB model, additional maximum likelihood estimates of the LEB model and the relationship of LEB estimates to those of various other models of occupation choice.",
    "We draw some confidence from the fact that these are secondary data and we are comparing its estimates to those from the SES dataset, with its temporal variation in wages consistent with the estimated model.",
    "Section 7 reports the simulations at the estimated and calibrated values for each dataset.",
    "However, the magnitude of the calibrated parameter A as reported below is comparable to the average amount of informal borrowing found in the Townsend-Thai dataset by those households who borrow informally.",
    "The data on labor share come also from the calculations of Tinakorn and Sussangkarn (1998) .",
    "Thus, we identify the production parameters by dividing the observations into two subsamples containing the households in the northeast 18See Jeong (1999) and Jeong and Townsend (2000) for details.",
    "In this section we first discuss the Thai macro dynamic data that will be used to calibrate the model and then discuss some issues concerning the calibration itself.",
    "Table 1 reports the estimated parameters as well as the standard errors 25 .",
    "This could be an explanation for some of the serial correlation in size, profits, and employment that is seen in actual data, even when shocks in the form of set up costs are independent and identically distributed over time and households There would be implications for the cross-sectional dispersion in growth rates.",
    "Data on the growth rate of GDP is taken from the computations of Tinakorn and Sussangkarn (1998) of the TDRI (Thailand Development Research Institute).",
    "or in terms of the estimated parameters,",
    "Data on the number of entrepreneurs as a fraction of the Thai population come from successive rounds of the national level income and expenditures socio-economic survey, the SES mentioned earlier, administered by the National Statistics Office.",
    "As mentioned before, Jeong (1999) constructs a measure of wealth from the SES data using observations on household assets and the value of owner occupied housing units.",
    "As an example, the business cycles literature has focused on models that are able to generate plausible co-movements of certain aggregate variables with output.",
    "More specifically, if we group the parameters m, C 1 l, C 21 , C 3 for Subsample 1 and m, C 12 , C 22 , C3 for Subsample 2, with m and C 3 common across subsamples, then the likelihood of the sample in the two regions is determined.",
    "In particular, we consider the normalized sum of the period by period squared deviations of the predictions of the model from the actual Thai data for the five time series 29 displayed in Table 2 in the Appendix.",
    "The calibrated values of parameter A are A = 0.0163 for the Townsend-Thai dataset and A = 0.0082 for the SES dataset.",
    "These may be viewed as robustness checks to the results presented in the previous sections.",
    "A trend from the 1990-1995 data was used to extrapolate labor share for 1996.",
    "Indeed, in related work Paulson and Townsend (2001) use the Townsend-Thai data to estimate via maximum likelihood methods not only the LEB model featured here, but also collateral based lending as in model of Evans and Jovanovic (1989) (EJ for short), for example, and also incentive-based lending as in the mechanism design literature of Aghion and Bolton (1997) and Lehnert (1998) (ABL for short).",
    "We report last the density of percentage changes in wealth in Figures 7e and 7g also in page 44 by integrating the 3D graph in Figure 7a over the estimated range of x and weighting each b point using both the credit and no-credit wealth distribution 3 7 .",
    "We now turn to the welfare comparison from the simulation using the best fit estimated MLE parameters using the SES data.",
    "The sample is nationally representative, and it includes eight repeated cross-sections collected between 1976 and 1996.",
    "See also Klinhowhan (1999) for further details.",
    "As in the Townsend-Thai dataset, if we look at the distribution of welfare gains in Figures 10e and 10e, page 47 , there is a significant fraction of agents who end up losing about half of their annual wealth.",
    "The mterested reader will find a more detailed explanation inJeong (1999).",
    "As in the complementary work of Jeong and Townsend (2000), we restrict attention to relatively young households, aged 20-29, whose current assets might be regarded somewhat exogenous to their recent choice of occupation.",
    "The maximized value of the likelihood function obtained using the SES data was -8,233.92 whereas the Townsend-Thai dataset yielded a value of -616.92.",
    "The parameters over which to search are again the production parameters (,B, a, p, a, (), the scaling factor s and the skewness m of H(., m).",
    "We also restrict attention to households who had no recorded transaction with a financial institution in the month prior to the interview, a crude 1'1n particular, we used the MATLAB routine fmincon starting from a variety of predetermined guesses \"See their technical appendix for more information about the estimation technique and its drawbacks ' 7 See Jeong(1999) for details or its use in Deaton and Paxson (2000) or Schultz (1997) .",
    "Unfortunately, the data do not constitute a panel, but when stratified by age of the household head, one is left with a substantial sample.",
    "The corresponding graphs are presented in Figure 6 , page 43.",
    "It allows 1 See for example Gallup, Radelet and Warner (1998) and Dollar and Kraay (2002) for evidence that growth helps reduce poverty and the concerns of Ravallion (2001 Ravallion ( , 2002 about their approach.",
    "The parameter y for both datasets was found by multiplying an estimate of the subsistence level from the data by the scaling factor estimated."
