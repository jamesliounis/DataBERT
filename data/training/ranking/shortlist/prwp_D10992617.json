    "12 The first paper to pose the solution to this problem in a modern analytical fashion is Williams (1936) .",
    "SeeBrennan, Williams, and Wright (1997) for a spatial-temporal model of an exporting region that gives some hint of the issues involved in modeling imports of food aid for a geographically dispersed population.",
    "For a more extensive discussion of the rationale for public intervention in storage markets, seeWright and Williams (1982b) andWilliams and Wright (1991, chapter 15).18 Even if we ignore this difficult issue, optimization of the details of location and operation presents a challenging spatial-temporal problem that deserves considerable attention before the proposal is implemented.",
    "See also Williams and Wright (1991, chapter 3) .",
    "The implementation proposal (von Braun and Torero 2009) quotes the results of Robles et al.",
    "(See Williams and Wright (1991, chapter 13) .)",
    "A solution method for storage models with responsive supply and rational expectations was first presented in Wright and Williams (1984) .",
    "See Williams and Wright (1991, chapter 14) .",
    "See Wright and Williams (1984) .",
    "Deaton and Laroque (1992, 1995, 1996.15 Cafiero, Bobenrieth, Bobenrieth, and Wright (2009).",
    "Figure 15 illustrates three probability densities for prices conditional on current prices at, respectively, 74%, 94%, and 114% of the mean generated by a numerical model of competitive storage.",
    "This figure and the associated argument draw on the work ofDawe (2009).",
    "(2009).35 SeeVerleger (2009) for related findings for the market for crude oil.",
    "( , 2009,Mitchell (2008),Timmer (2008), andGilbert (2008).4 Though Brazil is a major biofuel producer (using sugar cane), its production reportedly has not diverted large acreages from grain production.",
    "SeeBobenrieth, Bobenrieth and Wright (2004).",
    "See, for example,Subbarao (2003).20 Recent reports indicate that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, China, Russia, Jordan, Mozambique, Morocco, and Malawi are among the countries placing grain in national reserves.",
    "A more promising line of investigation is suggested by Figure 16 , which shows world stock-touse ratios for the sum of the three major grains (corn, wheat, and rice).",
    "For major grains, confirmation of this result is the subject of ongoing empirical research.",
    "First consider the evidence about the behavior over the past few years of aggregate food price, which was less variable than the prices of many of its components, including food grains in particular.",
    "3 The paper does not further address them except to note that these factors, although an important influence on the tightening overall grain market situation in prior years, could hardly have been surprises in 2007/08 except to the extent that continuations of already established trends were unexpected.",
    "See the Granger causality tests inSanders, Irwin, and Merrin (2008).",
    "There were comparable spikes around 1996-smaller for wheat, larger for maize.",
    "See Gilbert (1996, 2005 andGardner (1985) for excellent surveys of international agreements.",
    "33 See Bardsley (1994) , Gilbert (1996) , and Haszler (1998).",
    "One striking feature of recent chaos in grain markets is the paucity of timely data on available stocks in each country and particularly in Asia.",
    "There is a solution to this problem.",
    "Although On the basis of their tests, which, as noted, were overwhelmingly negative, von Braun and Torero (2009, p. 2) concluded that \"Appropriate global institutional arrangements for preventing this kind of market failure are needed.\"",
    "An important part of the answer is that the spikes, appropriately deflated, were not unusually large.",
    "The designated task of this study is, given the evidence at hand, to address the merits of recent proposals formulated in response to the sharp price spikes experienced in the last year or so and to focus on increasing the food security of vulnerable consumers.",
    "(2009) , which are Granger noncausality tests that actually find no evidence of influence by noncommercial long speculators on wheat or maize and only two significant cases of influence among 47 samples for rough rice, about what one would expect by chance at a 5% significance level.",
    "Figures 3 and 4, which offer a longer view, show that the prices of wheat and maize followed downward trends for decades, reflecting the fact that yields have generally outpaced demand growth, contrary to Malthusian predictions of the 1960's.",
    "where E t denotes the expectation conditional on information available in year t, and 1 t h \uf02b \uf025 and 1 t",
    "There is substantial agreement about the drivers of these longer run trends in grain consumption and prices.",
    "2 In 2005 the United Nations FAO food price index ( Figure 1 ) showed evidence of a modestly rising trend that had moved the index less than 20% higher than the 1998-2000 average.",
    "(Marc Sadler, personal communication, April 30, 2009.)",
    "Though stocks data are notoriously imprecise, minimum working stocks are apparently close to 20% of use.",
    "A glance at Figure 10 reveals that the wheat price spikes in the 1970s and in 2007/08 occurred when world stock-to-use ratios were low.",
    "World stock-to-use ratios for the sum of the three major grains (corn, wheat, and rice) (Source: USDA Foreign Agricultural Service -Production Supply and Distribution)",
    "In another interpretation that more closely reflects written sketches by von and Robles, Torero, and von Braun (2009) , the \"price band\" that they mention appears to be irrelevant; indeed, the function of the floor price is not discussed.",
    "Fortunately, the topic is not a new one.",
    "In view of the controversies surrounding the topic of grain stocks and other instruments to reduce price fluctuations in commodity markets, and at the request of the Organizing Committee of the World Grain Forum 2009, The World Bank (WB), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (the three sponsoring organizations) commissioned the present working paper on international grain reserves and other instruments to address volatility in grain markets.",
    "In 1972/73, for example, a reduction in world wheat production of less than 2% at a time when stocks were almost negligible caused the annual price to more than double, as indicated in Figure 3 .",
    "The answer must depend on the facts of each case, including the diversity of food supplies, dependability of traditional suppliers, and cost of the program.",
    "Look again at Figures 3 and 4 .",
    "The first satisfactory solution following the approach proposed by Williams did not appear until the 1950s in the pioneering dynamic model of Gustafson (1958) .",
    "In practice, postwar experience has affirmed that the \"finite time\" within which such programs fail is disconcertingly short, often less than a decade or two.",
    "To comprehend these distributional effects, it is necessary to recognize the dynamic nature of the problem and the importance of private responses to public actions.",
    "Thus a problem with wheat supply triggered a sequence of events-also involving other major exporters-that led to the crisis in rice prices and market access discussed in colorful detail by Slayton (2009) .",
    "Similarly, comparison of Figures 4 and 11 shows that spikes in corn price occurred when stock-to-use ratios were low.",
    "Like most studies of grain storage, the focus is on market aggregates, ignoring spatial variation and product heterogeneity, as well as on national policy variation regarding trade barriers, subsidies, and taxes, all of which affect the relation between reported global prices and prices faced by consumers."
