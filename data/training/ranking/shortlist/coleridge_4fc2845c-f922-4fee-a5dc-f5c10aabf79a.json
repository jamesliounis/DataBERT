    "To compare the spatial distribution of the bed changes in the entire estuary, the measured morphological changes over the three years are shown in Figure 4 (a) , in which the red color indicates deposition of sand, and the blue means erosion of bed.",
    "By testing the morphodynamic simulations for more than 12 runs, the site-specific calibrated parameters, B w = 3.0, and \u03b5 = 10.0, were obtained.",

    "The intercomparisons of the maximum water stages and bed changes revealed that Case 7, i.e.",
    "The hydrographs and the sediment properties for the two river inflows during the same period of the computation were provided by another research group in the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan The boundary conditions of tidal elevations and wave properties at the offshore in the three-year simulation were given by using a regional storm-surge model (a POM model) and the SWAN wave model (SWAN 2007) .",
    "The planning assessment procedure may briefly conclude as follows: (1) study the historical data about hydrology and morphology of the engineering site, (2) select the study area and computational domain, and generate numerical mesh to represent coastal/estuarine geometry and infrastructure (dikes, jetties, harbors, etc.",
    "This numerical software has been extensively verified and validated since it was developed in the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering at the University of Mississippi (e.g.",
    "The comparisons of the bed changes at the ten stations computed by using the calibrated parameters are shown in Figure 3 (b) ; it indicates that an excellent agreement between the measurements and observations was obtained at these selected stations in the estuary.",
    "By selecting several representative locations in the estuary, the highest water stages were extracted from the time histories of the computed water elevations.",
    "Hence, in terms of the integration numerical modeling and practical engineering knowledge on hydrological, morphological, meteorological, and geomorphic conditions, this study demonstrates a general procedure to achieve the best coastal/estuarine planning against flood and erosion.",
    "This integrated model for simulation of coastal estuarine morphodynamic processes has been built in a software package called CCHE2D (Jia et al., 2002) , which is a general tool to analyze two-dimensional (2D) shallow water flows, sediment transport, and water quality, with natural flow boundary conditions.",
    "Then, the validated CCHE2D-Coast was utilized to simulate hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses of the engineering plans to a hypothetical storm event containing a 100-year typhoon and a three-month monsoon.",
    "In order to investigate the performance of these engineering plans, simulations of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses to a hypothetical extreme typhoon event and a monsoon event were performed.",
    "The highest water stages in the monitoring stations in Case 7, i.e., Beiliao, Nanliao, Jiugang, and Touchien upstream, are lower than these in Case 4.",
    "Finally, the accuracy of the model to simulate the morphological changes is investigated by comparing the bed changes in all the measurement stations in the estuary.",
    "Moreover, some researchers proposed several semi-empirical numerical approaches to assess long-term morphological changes on both the meso-and macro-scales in coastal inlets and tidal lagoons in estuaries, e.g., tide-averaging approach and Rapid Assessment of Morphology (RAM) (e.g.",
    "Even though comparisons are made in this large estuarine area including the river reaches, the predication accuracy is still in a reasonable range which is acceptable for the engineering practical applications.",
    "In general, this was accomplished by sequentially computing wave field, flow field, and bed elevation changes.",
    "Meanwhile, only two empirical parameters were calibrated: an empirical parameter of sediment transport rate (B w ) in the Watanabe's total load formulation, and the coefficient of downslope gravitational effect (\u03b5) in the morphological change equation (see the definition in Ding et al., 2006b) .",
    "The frequency interval 0. )",
    "The bottom roughness coefficient, i.e., Manning's n, was set to 0.025 on the sea bed, and 0.033 on the river bed based on the 1D river simulation model.",
    "By visually comparing the two figure measurements and simulations, the following common features on deposition and erosion are found:\n(1) The long-term morphodynamic simulations correctly reproduced the erosion and breaching that occurred in the river mouth bar;\n(2) The simulations produced a similar erosion pattern at the head of the Beiliao island, even though the computed erosions are underestimated; (3) The simulated sand depositions in the south bank of the river mouth show a consistent deposition pattern with the observations; (4) The morphodynamic simulations produced a similar offshore bar development; yet, the size of the simulated offshore bar is larger than the observations; and (5) The simulated morphological changes in the Touchien River show almost the same size and locations of deposition and erosion, e.g., the erosion at the left bank and the deposition at the right bank near the Jiugang Island.",
    "To do so, the computed bed elevation changes at ten selected stations as shown in Figure 3 (a) were compared with the measured bed changes at the same locations.",
    "Before applying the model to evaluate coastal/estuarine design plans, model validation has been done by simulating hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes over a series of historical typhoon events happened in between 2004 and 2006.",
    "Figure 7 (a) and (b) show respectively a computed wave field (significant wave heights and mean directions) and currents at the time of the peak flood (t=12 h).",
    "Figure 8 (b) depicts the computed morphological changes in the estuary after the 100-year storm and flood, which quantitatively shows the coastal erosions in the river mouth, the breaching in the river mouth bar, the river mouth widening, and the offshore bar development due to the river sediment flushed down to the offshore.",
    "Figure 9 further depicts the time histories of water elevations at the seven monitoring stations, of which locations are shown in Figure 9 (a).",
    "However, in Cases 3, 4, and 6, in which the Jiugang channel is planned to be dredged, the storm flood water can trigger rapid deposition (more than 2 m) on the dredged channel bed.",
    "In comparison with Case 4, it is found that the removal of Beiliao Island can make the highest water stage lower by 0.63m at Beiliao, 0.79m at Nanliao, 0.24m at Jiugang, and 0.19m at Touchien upstream.",
    "Then, the validated models were applied to simulate hydrodynamic and morphodynamic responses in six engineering conceptual plans to a hypothetical long-term hydrological forcing, a storm-monsoon event.",
    "It has been widely used for simulations of waves, currents, sediment transport, and morphological changes in different scales of coasts and estuaries for the purposes of coastal/estuarine erosion protection and flood water management.",
    "To access impacts of extreme hydrological events such as hurricanes, storms, and high tides on coastal/estuarine areas with infrastructure, the most important capabilities of numerical models are to be able to accurately and robustly predict coastal flooding/inundation and coastal morphological changes due to these combined hydrological conditions over large-scale coastal/estuarine regions .",
    "Figure 7 (b) presents the computed currents and water elevations driven by the wave field shown in Figure 7 (a), tides, river floods, in which the breaching and the overbank flooding were predicted at the rivermouth bar.",
    "The simulated morphological changes through the three-year typhoon events are plotted in Figure 4 (b) with the same legend in Figure 4 (a).",
    "The wind speed data during the simulations were also provided by the regional storm-surge model.",
    "This software package contains three major submodels for simulating irregular wave deformations, tidal and waveinduced currents, sediment transport, and coastal morphological changes.",
    "By summarizing the above analysis of flood water stages and bed changes for all the seven cases, it is found that the planned dike with the Beiliao Island removed in Case 7 can better prevent inundation of the estuarine area of the Touchien River."
