    "We performed an ecological type study using aggregate data to explore differentials at a population level.",
    "The data analyzed belongs to the period January 1 st -September 30 th and was extracted on October 31 st to minimize missing information due to delays in the data registration.",
    "The data were taken from the public domain, which may not be accurate or confirmed by nations' public health units.",
    "is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
    "In such records, we observed a series of sociodemographic aspects (like sex, age, and region of residence) of individuals reported as suspect cases of COVID-19 and the moment of detection of the disease in those who turned out to be positive cases.",
    "In the present study, it was observed that Argentina and Colombia have a CDR Table 1 do not show any striking discrepancies in the mortality profile due to COVID-19 in the countries selected in our study, we find that only by decomposing the population with respect to sex the first differences emerge.",
    "The limitations of the present study and suggestions for future research are addressed.",
    "Therefore, this study aimed to explore the series of possible heterogeneities that could be found beneath the apparent similarity between two countries that appear to be matched when compared by indicators such as mortality.",
    "When information about death distributed by age groups is available, both CFR and PCDR could be expressed as the sum of the different death proportions (P) of cases (C) and population (N) respectively by age groups (e), which also could help us calculating rates in a given age group or interval.",
    "The search for additional indicators to illustrate both the recent and accumulated effect of infections has popularized internet pages such as Our World In Data (1) or Worldometer (2).",
    "= \u2211 * = \u2211 * However, given that population structure usually plays a part in calculating death rates (4) and fatality ratios (5), calculating standardized rates, by using the corresponding weight of the overall sum of positive cases detected (CW) and the weight of population (NW) of both countries respectively by ten age-groups, is desirable to make a more precise comparison.",
    "When we consider age composition, some dimensions of the impact of the pandemic between the two countries become much more evident, as well as the previously observed differences with respect to sex in context, showing that higher rates would correspond to a more aged population.",
    "The present study's objective is not to establish the \"real\" impact of mortality attributed to COVID-19 in Argentina and Colombia, but make an approximation given on the know information and the available sources.",
    "Within these indicators, the number of deaths per million inhabitants turned out to be one of the preferred ones to generate a ranking of the most affected countries.",
    "CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a perpetuity.",
    "This is mostly due to the lack of a full year of exposure, given that death rates are calculated (or at least they should be) as the quotient of deaths (D) and the mean population (N) in a given year (conventionally expressed in the population at June 30 or July 1).",
    "To compare deaths and cases by sex and age in a given date, we decided to consider data reported until September 30, 2020.",
    "In conclusion, any death rate comparison that is not sex or age adjusted might lead to a misrepresentation of the actual differences of the pandemic impact between countries.",
    "However, we consider that the present work eloquently shows that a global analysis of mortality is not sufficient to apprehend the specific effect of the pandemic in each country, even in cases where one can assume that they are comparable.",
    "In order to analyze these possible differences, we have scoped to draft a mortality profile of two South American countries that share, in addition to the same geographic region, other similarities such as the number of inhabitants: Argentina and Colombia.",
    "However, it must be mentioned that such information is sensitive to manual data processing errors, and that ex post health authorities may submit the records to modifications and changes.",
    "Actually, the mean population represents the average time that a given population has lived in a year, expressed in person-years as a result (3).",
    "That means, even if those data are updated continuously, they are not a replacement for the vital statistics provided by each country.",
    "These indicators' interpretation could be conditioned by variables such as demographic structure, socioeconomic status, or available health system resources.",
    "Given that the data were anonymized, public, and freely available, informed consents were not needed nor ethical committee approval.",
    "One of the most significant challenges has been determining the most accurate indicators to compare the pandemic impact between different regions (e.g.",
    "In the epidemiological analysis of COVID-19, the case fatality ratio (CFR) was a standard measure of the intensity of the pandemic.",
    "Simultaneously, the gradient in the partial death rate reverses after standardization: Colombia presents the highest standardized partial death rate (SPDR), both for males and females.",
    "The first route relies in some robust assumptions that maybe not be justified, given that seasonality may play a part in COVID-19 mortality.",
    "CFR is essentially the quotient between Deaths (D) and positive cases (C) detected.",
    "As of the database's cut-off date (30 st September 2020), there are no essential differences regarding mortality and global fatality from COVID-19 between the two countries.",
    "Specifically, Argentina and Colombia countries report similar figures for infection: 1.28 and 1.17 million cases, and 34,782 deaths in Argentina and 33,491 in Colombia.",
    "It must be noticed that, for both countries, the gap in CPDR between males tends to enlarge after standardization, but in terms of fatality ratio, it tends to decrease slightly.",
    "It is evident that its effect has been heterogeneous in the different continents, and there is a consensus that it has been less harmful in Asia, Africa, and Oceania than in Europe or America.",
    "Standardized case fatality ratios (SCFR) and standardized partial death rates (SPDR) should be expressed as the following.",
    "impact is evident in the total estimates.",
    "Meanwhile, on March 6, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Colombia.",
    "Additionally, they also record the date of death.",
    "There is no doubt that the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had great health and economic impact globally, although it is still difficult to measure it accurately.",
    "It is also worth mentioning how the gender gap in Argentina is notorious.",
    "However, the same differential cannot be directly extrapolated with respect to the pandemic's adverse effects since they are not standardized by age.",
    "On March 2, 2020, the first patient was detected in Argentina.",
    "The difference in fatality between Argentina and Colombia is 0.75 points per thousand.",
    "However, there has been less emphasis in death rates attributed to COVID-19.",
    "There is almost 15% more \"premature\" mortality in Colombia compared to Argentina in women, and little more than 5% in men.",
    "Nine months after the first infections, after more than 52.6 million infections worldwide and more than 1.29 million deaths worldwide.",
    "Furthermore, not every death assigned to a positive case implies that COVID-19 was the cause of death."
