    "The paper is structured as follows.",
    "Source: Authors' own elaboration",
    "SeeBarron et al, (2023), for a more detailed discussion.",
    "For similar results see also Belloni, Chernozhukov and Hansen (2014) and Sosa-Escudero, Anauati and Brau (2022).",
    "The data used in this study comes from the Latinobar\u00f3metro Survey for 2020 (Latinobar\u00f3metro Corporation 2021), the latest year available.",
    "In one recent paper, Lee and Schachter (2019) investigate the relationship between trust in government and citizen participation in the United States using data from the World Values Survey.",
    "In the context of our study, however, given the low correlation between regressors (see table B1 in Annex B) and given that the number of observations exceeds the number of regressors, the Lasso approach is more fitting to our sample than the other techniques.",
    "See Ahrens, Hansen and Schaffer (2020) for details on the rigorous approach.",
    "For details on these approaches, seeAhrens, Hansen and Schaffer (2020).",
    "The resulting models are presented in Table 3 , below.",
    "The analyses conducted here can be replicated elsewhere by developing machine learning methods able to \"learn\" from datasets covering other regional or national settings.",
    "In the context of this study, the estimated Logit model is useful in determining the set of statistically significant independent variables relating to citizen involvement.",
    "This fills a geographical gap raised by some authors (see Rizzo, 2021) , who also point out the predominance of macro-level, case-based studies that fail to account for citizens' individual perspectives.",
    "See Devarajan and Ianchovichina (2018) .",
    "The dependent variable in model 2 in Table 2 is participating in demonstrations.",
    "In section 3, we describe the data utilized in the analyses and discuss the current state of and trends in trust in government and citizen participation in the region.",
    "While those will also be analyzed in the empirical section of this paper, our primary interest is on complex nonlinear links.",
    "The analyses conducted include a set of control variables that previous research has shown to predict whether a person will participate (Lee and Schachter, 2019) .",
    "Rather, our study builds on the work of Lee and Schachter (2019) in incorporating a machine learning approach and expanding the analysis to the LAC region.",
    "Table 4 below maps the results of evaluating both hypotheses, based on the sign and statistical significance of the estimated coefficient between trust in a governmental institution and a specific form of political participation.",
    "The latest available survey data was released in October 2021 and comprises 20,204 observations that represent more than 600 million inhabitants in the region.",
    "2010; Kumagai and Iorio, 2020) .",
    "In this literature, the higher an individual's socioeconomic level, the greater their ability to participate (Lee and Schachter, 2019; Dalton, Burklin and Drummond, 2001; Gastil et al., 2008; Newman, Johnson, and Lown, 2014; Verba and Nie, 1987) .",
    "Samples refer to the number of observations that are classified in each node.",
    "As Ahrens, Hansen and Schaffer (2020) point out, regularized regressions tend to select the true model as the sample size increases.",
    "Table 3 shows the post-Lasso results obtained by running Logit regressions with the covariates selected by Lasso.",
    "We first compute the variable importance score (see figures D1-D3 in Annex D), which identifies the characteristics that are most salient in determining citizen participation.",
    "In order to help address this methodological gap, this paper evaluates the analytical implications presented by social complexities, and the extent to which different approaches capture such complexities.",
    "Finally, in section 6, we conclude and reflect on how machine learning methods can be used in other contexts for similar analyses.",
    "For example, suppose we have a dependent variable y and a set of predictors x1, x2,..,xk.",
    "These can be observed in table C1 in Annex C. Brazil, Mexico and Guatemala are the countries with statistically significant country fixed effects for all three categories of political participation analyzed.",
    "13 For brevity, Table 2 below only reports those related to trust and some selected individual controls.",
    "Sources: Latinobar\u00f3metro Corporation (2021); Cuesta, Madrigal and Pecorari (2022) As illustrated in Figure 2 , and in accordance with global trends, trust in national governments has declined since 2009 for most LAC countries.",
    "Value tells how many observations at the given node fall into each category or class, in our case, we have two classes: has worked on a community problem in the past year or not.",
    "16 For estimation purposes, we used the function rlassoLogit from the LASSOPACK package in Stata 16.",
    "For the purpose of the estimation, we employed the Scikit-Learn 1.1.1 library in Python 3.10.5, and used the function DecisionTreeClassifier.",
    "14 For the purpose of the estimation, we employed the Logit command in Stata 16.",
    "Note, in addition, that this result extends to logistic regressions.",
    "We rely on data from the Latinobar\u00f3metro 2020 and explore the existence of a relationship between trust in government and citizen participation in the LAC region.",
    "For example, in Logit and Lasso estimations, being employed was an important factor in determining engagement in its three forms.",
    "These variables are now likely capturing most of the effect that was previously attributed to employment.",
    "In this way, Lasso provides a method for choosing the model when the sample size is large and there are many potential regressors, facilitating model interpretation.",
    "14 Signing a petition is the dependent variable in model 1 of Table 2 .",
    "By and large, the pool of covariates that remains with Lasso estimation reassuringly coincides with covariates found significant in the preceding Logit analysis-save for the notorious dropping of trust in national governments.",
    "Additionally, we will compute the variable importance metric, which assesses each variable's relevance within the broader citizen participation model.",
    "Most importantly, our work provides an innovative approach to analyzing the relationship between political trust and citizen participation by investigating nonlinearities and complexities in the way explanatory variables interact and have an impact on the dependent variable-that is, citizen participation in the various forms considered in this study.",
    "In particular, we compare how empirical findings vary depending on the use of a) simple econometric models that impose linear relationships in their estimation, versus b) more sophisticated models using machine learning to capture complex non-linearities.",
    "Second, we focus the analysis across multiple countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region simultaneously using comparable data.",
    "3 This comparative analysis does not undermine the need for case studies that provide further insights into specific contexts such as, for example, the sudden and dramatic increase in political trust in El Salvador or the effects on trust that Constitutional referendums have (as recently held in Chile), to mention a few examples.",
    "Ultimately, we provide insights on the extent to which the significance and precision of results are sensitive to different estimation and prediction methodologies."
