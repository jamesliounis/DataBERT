    "Table 3 .1 provides a snapshot of data collection efforts divided by area of study.",
    "Notes: 1) Cells with a check mark represent data collected by the team and published in this paper.",
    "Detailed information about all case assumptions, questionnaire definitions, and samples are provided under Data Notes in Appendix A.",
    "First, the paper discusses the current knowledge gaps and the project's contribution to the existing literature and evidence.",
    "2011; Martin and Pimhidzai 2013) .",
    "See the survey byDjankov (2009).",
    "The collected data were also cross-referenced with other publicly available databases from nongovernmental, civil society, and international organizations.",
    "The information provided by contributors was cross-checked with information collected by the team through desk research on the applicable laws, regulations, and information available on institutional websites.",
    "The methodology is based on the application of topic-specific questionnaires to build a comprehensive data set.",
    "2003; Gauthier and Reinikka 2008; Fiszbein et al.",
    "For each area of study and in each country, data would be collected through interviews with several experts who would answer questions about processes and regulations applying to a specific prototypical case (contributor data).",
    "For example, the ACE Project's comparative data set analyzes registration systems adopted worldwide and relates them to government performance under three criteria: currency, accurateness, and completeness (ACE: The Electoral Knowledge Network 2013).",
    "Case study assumptions were designed to gather comparable data across different areas of study by referring to prototypical individuals with the same gender, age range, and place of residence.",
    "Second, data was to be collected through a representative survey of citizens who would answer questions about their own experiences (user data).",
    "6, 7, 8 Once the six main areas of study were chosen, the team conducted extensive desk research and consultations with World Bank Group (WBG) experts to understand the particularities of each topic, to identify the type of data that should be collected, and to structure questions for maximum reliability of interpretation across respondents.",
    "Where indicated in each questionnaire, questions attempt to collect data regarding the possibility of completing steps and procedures online and the adoption of electronic systems and/or digitized databases by service providers.",
    "Finally, the paper discusses lessons learned and next steps for improving its methodology and expanding data coverage to a larger number of countries.",
    "This was mainly observed while attempting to collect data for areas such as paying taxes, access to health, access to education, and access to utilities.",
    "In cases where it was not possible to verify the information through desk research (e.g.",
    "Respondents also took into consideration the following assumptions:",
    "The study also includes data on billing and payment methods and redress mechanisms such as the availability of smart meters and consumption benchmarking.",
    "5 Table 2 .1 lists all the areas of study and highlights the relevant associated SDGs.",
    "Feedback provided by contributors during the first round of data collection was indispensable to understanding the relevance of questions that were being asked and refining the survey's structure for future data collection.",
    "Following the 2004 WDR publication, the World Bank promoted several data collection initiatives to measure service quality and performance in schools and health facilities as well as initiatives to analyze accountability systems (Dehn at al.",
    "Refining the methodology and expanding the data collection coverage can lead to the creation of a relevant set of indicators, can generate a global public database on bureaucratic quality, and can foster policy dialogue around key areas of public service provision.",
    "The Living Life study fills a gap in the existing data sources on governance, but it can also be analyzed in a complementary fashion with some existing indicators.",
    "The World Bank's Doing Business project (World Bank 2018a) and the vast empirical literature using its data provide numerous examples of how bureaucratic complexity can affect a firm's ability to operate and grow.",
    "Further details on surveys and variables can be found in the appendices.",
    "The availability of quality data in these areas relies heavily on efficient civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems.",
    "In this study, procedures for exercising rights and accessing services are compared to recognized best practices, where available.",
    "The team concluded that contributor-based data collection is an adequate tool for soliciting responses on legal and procedural regulations, but it does not provide a complete picture of the practical aspects of citizen-government interactions.",
    "First, the surveys designed for this study attempted to collect data on both the legal/procedural requirements, and the practical side of citizen interaction with governments and services providers.",
    "as well as data on obtaining IDs.",
    "Therefore, surveys aimed at collecting data from a representative sample of households would be the optimal approach to retrieve data about citizen-government interactions based on the respondents' own experiences.",
    "Data collection was carried out from October 2016 through July 2017.",
    "The case assumptions in the questionnaires reflect 3 times the GNI per capita Atlas Method (in current USD) as made available by the World Bank Database for the year 2015.",
    "Table 3 .4 below provides a summary of the number of procedures between citizens and health care providers by service and economy.",
    "Adding a larger set of countries for data collection may result in greater variability and more robust conclusions.",
    "The following concepts were defined and included in each of the questionnaires in order to assist contributors while answering the questionnaire, and the team during the coding process:",
    "Moving forward, the team should refine and redesign the questionnaires according to the type of data collection -contributor-based or household survey -with relevant questions that target specific audiences.",
    "Second, the paper presents the results from pilot data collected in four countries: Chile, Ghana, India, and Vietnam.",
    "As discussed in the next section, these key interactions were selected through consultation with experts across the World Bank Group as well as a thorough review of the literature.",
    "The pilot stage of the project has produced and tested a data collection methodology that could eventually be refined and scaled to a larger number of countries.",
    "Where relevant data are available, topics are analyzed through the lens of government performance, rather than through the citizen's perspective and experience of the process.",
    "Even within this limited scope, the initial plan for data collection was very ambitious as it entailed two respondent data groups.",
    "The Access to Health questionnaire attempted to capture the process for accessing public health institutions that are most commonly used for each of the services provided.",
    "The present research project, however, has proven itself useful in outlining specific legal and regulatory frameworks for the selected citizen-government interactions, which can be used for future reference and the eventual development of more sophisticated research tools.",
    "During this time, the team contacted contributors to retrieve their completed questionnaires or to clarify questions that were not clear during the coding process.",
    "However, the case study assumptions approach applied to data collection also has limitations.",
    "The methodology for data collection was applied in four economies representing different regions: Chile, Ghana, India, and Vietnam."
