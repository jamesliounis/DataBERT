    "Disclaimer and Acknowledgments: This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken by Census Bureau staff.",
    "This paper will discuss related research, followed by the M PW EB's survey methodology, results, and recommendations.",
    "* Household level screener questions There is a wide range of research available regarding response rates, some of which was discussed earlier in this paper.",
    "The MPWEB sample was drawn from that of an existing MP demographic survey, the Methods Panel Survey of Income and Program Participation (MPSIPP).",
    "The U.S. Census Bureau's Demographic Surveys Division (DSD) is committed to testing alternative methods of data collection, and thus conducted the Methods Panel Web (MPWEB) survey.",
    "The most recent, and probably the most accurate measures are from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) Internet and computer use supplement, fielded in August 2000.",
    "We want to look at item non-response and demographic characteristics of respondents vs. non-respondents.",
    "We would also like to compare our response rates and rate of return to a comparable sample of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).",
    "The results will aid in determining what proportion of the population under the most optimistic scenario is willing to and actually does respond to long, complex household surveys using the Internet.",
    "Such analyses may help us to better understand who, exactly, does respond via the Internet, and thus the potential for future online research.",
    "Data from the supplement show that 44.4 percent of individuals in the U.S. have Internet access, up from 32.7 percent in December 1998.",
    "The MPWEB instrument was based on a modified version of the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), and asked about work experience, principal employer, career related experiences and recent education.",
    "The remainder of this paper will discuss the MPW EB's survey methodology, results, and recommendations.",
    "We received daily progress reports from the Census Bureau's Computer Assisted Survey Research Office (CASRO).",
    "The 2000 CPS data found that people whose highest level of education is a Bachelor's degree or higher had the highest Internet use (74.5 percent).",
    "Other reasons discussed in the literature include technical difficulties (Couper, Blair, and Triplett, 1999), the respondent's inability to determine the questionnaire length (Ramos, Sedivi, and Sweet, 1997;Abraham, Steiger, and Sullivan, 1998), perceived lack of Internet expertise, and cost of Internet service for limited usage plans.",
    "They tested an Internet survey using the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG).",
    "The paper debriefing questionnaires from those who did not attempt to access the survey online show that the vast majority of people did not attempt to access the survey because they didn't have time.",
    "We plan to perform additional analyses on the MPWEB data in the near future.",
    "The literature reveals that two of the main factors driving the tremendous growth in online research are lower costs and response time.",
    "Internet surveys have proven useful for specific types of samples, however the Bureau conducts many demographic surveys which represent the country as a whole.",
    "Some users are used to searching for Web sites using a search engine.",
    "The U.S. Census Bureau's Methods Panel Web (MPWEB) survey tested whether the Internet is a viable reporting method for such surveys, especially those that utilize large, complex instruments.",
    "Other Census Bureau online surveys have used Delphi downloadable executables, HTML, HTML with Java Script, and Java.",
    "The objective was to measure the response rate for members of eligible households (those with at least one college graduate) that indicated willingness to complete a survey on the Internet during a prior MP interview.",
    "Another relevant study was conducted by Westat in 1999.",
    "If the screener question that ascertained willingness to complete an online survey is eliminated, the overall response rate was 14 percent of those who had Internet access (see Table 2).",
    "Kwak and Radler (2000) reported that the cost of delivering their Web data set was less than one-fourth of the cost for their mail data set, and their Web survey was more than four times faster than their mail survey.",
    "They prescreened college graduates for Internet access, and they, too, achieved a 27 percent response rate via the Web (Collins and Tsapogas, 2000).",
    "Like computer-assisted systems, online questionnaires utilize real time skips and edits within the instrument, improving data quality, reducing the time needed to clean and edit the data, and decreasing respondent burden (Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000;Kwak and Radler, 2000;Abraham, Steiger, and Sullivan, 1998).",
    "Although such studies reveal improvements in cost, time, and quality, they also reveal concerns about coverage and response rates.",
    "Such statistics led us to believe that the MPWEB sample would be more likely than others to not only have access to, but use the Internet.",
    "The MPWEB tested whether the Internet is a viable reporting method for long, complex demographic survey instruments.",
    "Of those discussed, the MPWEB most closely resembles the 1998 Company Organization Survey (COS), which also pre-screened respondents.",
    "The COS collects information from businesses, however, which typically have greater Internet access and ability than individuals, and may therefore account for much of the difference (Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000;Sweet and Russell, 1996).",
    "This was feasible because these respondents were selected from households that reported both the ability and willingness to complete the survey online.",
    "Respondent Assistance: We were only contacted by eight respondents throughout the data collection period.",
    "Collectively, encryption, authentication, and a firewall provide a secure method for the Census Bureau to collect data on the Internet (Kanarek and Sedivi, 2000;Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000).",
    "The sample for the 1998 Company Organization Survey (COS) reported that they were interested and had the ability to report online, but only 27 percent actually did so (Sedivi, Nichols, and Kanarek, 2000).",
    "There are varying estimates of the numbers and types of people who currently have Internet access.",
    "Such issues may limit the U.S. Census Bureau's ability to take advantage of online data collection, particularly among household surveys.",
    "Although the MPWEB tested the Internet as a sole method of data collection, our low response rate combined with technological challenges and limitations indicate that the costs of converting a complex questionnaire to an online survey far outweigh the benefits we may see, even in a multi-mode environment.",
    "It may also be advantageous for future online surveys to provide a keyword for AOL.",
    "Research conducted by Abreu and Winters (1999) shows that it does, so we would recommend the use of priority mail in the future.",
    "Studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of electronic surveys, both via e-mail and the Internet.",
    "Compared to traditional research methodologies, online studies are conducted with an average savings of more than 40 percent in cost and cycle time (Rosenblum and Grecco, 1998).",
    "The ability to better identify specific types of technical problems will help researchers overcome some of the issues related to online surveys.",
    "Future researchers should keep any respondent downloads to an absolute minimum whenever possible.",
    "Debriefing Questionnaire: We received a total of 79 online respondent debriefing questionnaires and 65 paper non-respondent questionnaires for a debriefing response rate of 41%.",
    "Low response rates were also experienced when respondents were pre-screened."
