    "(2013) ; Hangartner et al.",
    "A limited number of other papers, e.g.",
    "(2014) ; Ruiz and Vargas-Silva (2015) ; Borjas and Monras (2017) ; Tumen (2016) ; and Alix-Garcia et al.",
    "For the purposes of this study, we used the monthly data set with zonal statistics up to ADM3-level aggregation, comprising governorate, district, and sub-district divisions.",
    "The analysis in this paper also contributes to a second, and more established, strand of literature, which focuses on temporary migrations.",
    "The study of refugee returns is a data-demanding process in a data-poor field.",
    "This section refers to the findings of World Bank (2019) unless noted otherwise.",
    "We make progress on the first part by combining different sources and types of data.",
    "These data provide important contextual information on the correlations between income, food security and employment status.",
    "The next section will discuss how we leverage the different dimensions of this data set for our purposes.",
    "The data is analyzed using a straightforward regression specification:",
    "Table 7 provides a formal test of the descriptive statistics reported in section 4.1.",
    "within Low conflict or within High conflict) reference category is statistically significant.",
    "We complement the study of returns that have already happened with data from hypothetical vignettes.",
    "Thus, we adopt a pragmatic approach that combines different sources and types of data.",
    "Our data from the Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) in Jordan comprises two years: 2015 and 2017 (sampled cases: 2,163 and 2,001), which are comparable.",
    "Results are shown in Table 9 .",
    "As this section of the paper is descriptive, we cannot give a reason for this finding.",
    "This paper continues as follows.",
    "To analyze these factors, we need a comprehensive data set, which is often not available especially in active conflict situations.",
    "An expansive literature on temporary (voluntary) migration has shown that ignoring this selection can distort the assessment of migrants' assimilation profiles and, by corollary, their economic impact.",
    "The literature on temporary (economic) migrations can provide important insights on these findings.",
    "This data set provides a record of verified conflict-driven casualties, changes in area control, and key conflict events (light skirmishes, airstrikes, artillery strikes, and chemical attacks) using more than 7,000 news items and multiple databases.",
    "Any future research that expands the respective data space, especially longitudinally, and examines the validity of our results in different refugee situations will help improve our understanding significantly.",
    "Given that the semi-parametric Cox model is robust to arbitrary distributional assumptions, it is our preferred specification for the remainder of the paper.",
    "Finally, for conditions in Syria, we have compiled a novel monthly conflict events data set to use along with nighttime light emissions data that proxies access to utilities.",
    "The remaining columns estimate continuous time proportional hazard models, assuming an exponential baseline hazard in columns (3) and (4) and using the semi-parametric Cox model in columns (5) and (6).",
    "Overall, our ability to put together a comprehensive data set with key dimensions (micro-characteristics of refugees, conflict dynamics, and the conditions in the countries of asylum and origin) has made the analysis of return decisions possible.",
    "These results are reported in Table 8, where individual controls from ProGres are suppressed for ease of exposition.",
    "For the overall data set, we can assume that the information is up-to-date on average for 2017.",
    "Given that our data is grouped monthly, we first estimate the complementary loglog (cloglog) model with robust standard errors clustered at the origin district level as follows:",
    "In addition, activity-specific databases have been consulted, including airwars.org and Arms Control Organization timeline of confirmed chemical weapon use in Syria.",
    "20 The regression specification is E(returns lmt) = \u03b4 l exp(\u03b2 1 + \u03b2 2 f oodsec lt + \u03b2 3 housing lt + \u03c4 t )where delta l is the location specific fixed effect and all other variables are defined as in equation 3.Since the VAF and VASyr surveys were only conducted during the 2015-2017 period, we only estimate the regression for this subset of years.",
    "Gibson and McKenzie (2011) use a cross-section survey of top high-school performers of cohorts from 1976 to 2004 in Tonga, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand to assess the determinants of migration and return decisions.",
    "However, an inherent challenge in the literature on conflict and forced migration is the absence of a complete longitudinal data set for conditions in countries of asylum and origin that can be mapped onto refugee characteristics.",
    "Bauer and Sinning (2011) and Dustmann (1997) provide empirical evidence for these arguments using migrant savings and labor force participation data from Germany, respectively.",
    "The analysis proceeds in two parts: we first analyze a panel data set, constructed at the sub-district level within Syria, 12 to understand the relationship between returns and security and access to utilities in Syria.",
    "where X is the demographic characteristic(s) explored in the panel.",
    "This literature includes a rapidly growing number of works that consider the effects of forced migration on locals in the following areas: employment, wage, entrepreneurship and consumption (Braun and Kvasnicka (2014); Moser et al.",
    "The third section describes our data and empirical strategy.",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages of both of these data sources.",
    "With detailed arrival and return information from the ProGres database, we construct an unbalanced individual-level panel.",
    "Formally, we estimate the following specification:",
    "The hazard rate is greater for men in the multivariate regression, in contrast to the simple plots we showed in section 4.1.2.",
    "As part of this survey, we also collected information on the vulnerability of the surveyed refugees using the subset of common questions from the VAF and VASyr surveys.",
    "Column (1) presents the results for the cloglog model using origin district and country of asylum fixed effects.",
    "Our analysis with novel subdistrict-month panel data shows that better security and improved access to utilities, as proxied by nightlight luminosity, at the location of origin increase the likelihood of return.",
    "Notes: Using the average CEI for the district (see footnote in Figure 4 for details), we defined high-conflict districts as those districts where the average CEI fell in top 10 percentile.",
    "The contribution of the paper, however, is instead to understand factors related to early, voluntary return.",
    "Moreover, Column (2) shows that better housing conditions -proxied for by the housing PCA index -also increase the hazard rate by a similar magnitude."
