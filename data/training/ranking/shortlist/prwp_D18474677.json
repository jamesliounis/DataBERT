    "Section I explains the combination of survey and administrative data we use in the analysis.",
    "Timmins & Jennifer Murdock 2007)",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
    "We draw on two types of data: household survey data, which underlies the core of our analysis, and school-level administrative data.",
    "To examine the extent to which NERs at the district and average pupil-teacher ratios in public schools are linked, we use data from EMIS, which contains detailed information on all public schools in Kenya.",
    "Since 1 The results from the estimation are given in Table 3 .",
    "Yet numerous studies, particularly in the health literature, have posited a trade-off between free provision and reduced quality of public services (Chris D James, Kara Hanson, Barbara McPake, Dina Balabanova, Davidson Gwatkin, Ian Hopwood, Christina Kirunga, Rudolph Knippenberg, Bruno Meessen, Saul S Morris et al.",
    "2006 , Bruno Meessen, Lucy Gilson & Abdelmajid Tibouti 2011 , Samia Laokri, Olivier Weil, K Maxime Drabo, S Mathurin Dembel\u00e9, Beno\u00eet Kafando & Bruno Dujardin 2013 , Mylene Lagarde & Natasha Palmer 2008 .",
    "They replicate findings from, e.g., T. Paul Schultz (2004) who finds significant positive effects of Mexico's PROGRESA cash transfer program on enrollment, but demonstrate that these effects are subject to strongly diminishing returns as the size of the transfer is increased.",
    "(3) For comparison purposes, columns (5) -(7) report the results from the same analysis applied to expenditure on secondary education.",
    "However, the EMIS data on changes in pupil-teacher ratios underlying Scenario 1 are potentially problematic during this period Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, but using the enrollment growth rates reported in the household survey data.",
    "In the Kenyan context, Milu Charles Muyanga, John Olwande, Esther Mueni & Stella Wambugu (2010) apply propensity score matching methods to a panel data set of rural households to estimate a 7% increase in net enrollment spread across public and private primary schools with the largest response coming from higher income groups.",
    "Note that the reduction in fees per pupil observed in columns (1) and (2) may reflect a price change at a given school, or a shift in demand from low-cost to higher-cost schools.",
    "Our paper is also related to the literature estimating spillover effects in enrollment decisions.",
    "We document this shift by comparing enrollment patterns across several dimensions: in public primary schools before and after the reform, across primary schools where fees were abolished versus secondary schools where fees remain, and between public versus private primary schools -analogous to a triple-differences estimator.",
    "We build on this framework in the following sections to explore the determinants of the changes observed here.",
    "The table reports the marginal effects of a change in these regressors on the probability of enrollment.",
    "This is indeed the case, as can be seen from column (4)-(6) of Table 3 .",
    "We lack data on teacher salaries for more than one point in time, however starting teacher salaries increased substantially during this period, likely pushing up the average.",
    "This effect is estimated to be -0.0006 and strongly significant with a t-value of -4.17.",
    "For comparison, we also report changes in the net enrollment rate in the secondary sector on the right hand panel of Table 2 .",
    "Both data sets are nationally representative and span the period before and after the enactment of FPE.",
    "In trying to identify the local spillover effect \u03b1 in 5 The characteristics of a valid instrument in this context are that it be correlated with the number of pupils who choose a given school, but not correlated with the unobserved fixed attributes of that school.",
    "Note that the statistics inTable 4represent average expenditure per pupil conditional on enrollment.",
    "The remainder of the paper seeks to explain this shift.",
    "This section attempts a reckoning of the net changes in school resources under FPE, combining household data sources on parental contributions with official government data on capitation grants and pupil-teacher ratios.",
    "A large literature examining school choice finds that test scores are a good summary of the dimensions parents care about when enrolling in a particular school (Sandra E Black 1999 , Mark Schneider & Jack Buckley 2002 , Alejandra Mizala & Miguel Urquiola 2013 .",
    "The table reports estimates of Equation (5), the second step of the Bayer-Timmins procedure.",
    "This can be seen by comparing column (2) to (5) and (3) to (6), respectively.",
    "The penultimate row of Table 4 presents the p-value from a test of the null hypothesis that the percentage increase in expenditure per pupil on private primary schools is no greater than the percentage increase in expenditure on private secondary schools:",
    "As can be seen from Figure 1 , which plots the predicted probability of enrolling in the two sectors before and after FPE based on the multinomial logit in columnn (2), these average effects imply big and significant changes following FPE at both the top and the bottom of the socio-economic distribution.",
    "Having estimated the sector-district-time fixed effects \u03b4 m j,t in the first step, the second-step (5) consists of a linear regression of the predicted value of enrolling in a school sector on its various determinants.",
    "The first step of this procedure consists of estimating the probability that a household enrols in a particular school sector as a function of the individual specific regressors as well as a districtsector-time fixed effect.",
    "The intra-class correlation within a district for KCPE varies between 15%-25% (across sectors and before and after FPE) and we would therefore argue that the collapsed scores contain some relevant information.",
    "Figure 1: Predicted enrollment by household head's education, before and after FPE, based on the multinomial logit in Table 3 , column 2.",
    "Because the FPE reform was instituted simultaneously nationwide, we base our inferences about the effect of FPE on a comparison of the trajectories of enrollment and prices across two dimensions: public versus private primary schools, and primary versus secondary schools.",
    "The core weakness in any causal interpretation of the estimates in columns (1) -(3) taken in isolation is that the shift in enrollment toward private primary schools may reflect a simple secular trend of increasing demand for high-quality schooling.",
    "The dependent variable is the district-sector-time fixed effect from the conditional logit in Table ( 3).",
    "The dependent variable is formed by the vector of predicted sectordistrict-time fixed effects which were estimated as part of the discrete choice model in Section II.",
    "The comparison of trends in primary enrollment to secondary enrollment provides a second, completely independent control group that allows us to address concerns about causal inference that may not be answered using data on public and private primary schools alone.",
    "In the second step, we estimate how this fixed value of enrolling in a particular sector that is common across all households, \u03b4 m j,t , is affected by changes in observable school-level attributes and the enrollment behaviour of others.",
    "The results of this analysis are equivalent to the conditional logit model presented in Section II.",
    "Use\u03b2 1,j and an initial guess for\u03b2 0 0 , the coefficients on observable school-level characteristics, to construct the instrumented enrollment shares\u03c3 m j,t",
    "The first two columns present the 'naive' OLS results and the third and fourth column presents the IV estimates.",
    "We regress the fixed effects on end of primary leaving exam scores, the share of pupils choosing the same school type, and a set of dummies for government and private school as well as their respective interactions with an FPE dummy.",
    "Households indexed by i maximize utility by choosing between three schooling options j = {N, G, P }, i.e.",
    "The reported effects are equivalent to average marginal effectswhere the average is taken across all observations in the sample -in a standard multinomial logit estimation.",
    "Both Gustavo J Bobonis & Frederico Finan (2009) and Rafael Lalive & M Alejandra Cattaneo (2009) use random placement of the PROGRESA program to identify large and positive spillover effects in enrollment.",
    "The analysis of education expenditure and enrollment is based on two consecutive, nationallyrepresentative, cross-sectional, household surveys conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of",
    "For the pre-FPE period, there is a positive, and significant association between the household head's education and the child's probability of enrollment in government primary school: every additional year of education increased the probability of public school enrollment by 0.7% in column (2) and (3)."
