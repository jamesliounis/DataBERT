Excessive bureaucracy can also retard progress toward the goals of eliminating poverty and promoting shared prosperity. For example, the compliance burden generated by administrative rules has the effect of restricting access to political rights. Voter registration issues account for a large percentage of nonvoters during elections (Alvarez et al. 2008) . Administrative barriers reduce enrollment in social programs and access to health care (Currie 2004; Moynihan and Herd 2010) . Legal issues can prevent households from connecting to public utilities such as water and electricity (Banerjee et al. 2008) .",

        "text": "While the effect of bureaucratic burden on the private business sector is measured and constantly monitored by governments who regularly consult the World Bank's Doing Business database, to date little attention has been paid to the effects of bureaucracy on the lives of private citizens. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the cost (either monetary or cognitive) of key interactions such as voting, obtaining identification, registering a birth, or accessing health care have the potential to limit a citizen's access to basic rights and freedoms that should be universally guaranteed. The most vulnerable groups in the population are most at risk for infringement on access and rights. Drawing upon 78 participatory poverty assessments (PPAs) in different countries, the 2000 report Voices of the Poor remarked that \"poor people's interactions with representatives of the state leave them feeling powerless, unheard, and silenced\" (Narayan et al. 2000, 65) . The report found that \"the poor experience many barriers in trying to access government-provided services. These include bureaucratic hurdles, rules and regulations, the need for documents, and difficulties in accessing information\" (Narayan et al. 2000, 65) . When bureaucracy imposes excessively complicated procedures to access public services or state entitlements, the poor are more likely to be affected as more affluent and more educated citizens can better manage their way around the rules or more easily bear the costs of compliance. Simplifying the procedures and reducing the costs associated with citizen-government interactions would therefore empower the poor to take better advantage of the services and rights to which they are entitled. This paper presents pilot results from a new World Bank project, Living Life. The project developed and tested a methodology to collect data on the bureaucratic complexity in citizen-government interactions that is essential for accessing basic services and for exercising fundamental rights and civic duties.",

The ECB indicator measures the efficiency of government performance by comparing inputs (public spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP)) to outcomes, while Living Life measures the ease of access to those basic public services as opposed to the outcomes or the quality of those outcomes. The WGI's Government Effectiveness Dimension captures \"perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies\" (Kaufmann et al. 2010, 223) . Living Life, on the other hand, attempts to establish more objective measures of bureaucratic performance by accounting for time, processes, steps, and costs. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index's performance measurement of government institutions and the IMD Business School's world competitiveness rankings both examine enhanced economic growth and prosperity, whereas Living Life focuses on the quality of interaction between citizen and governments. however, focusing on the actual procedures and steps undertaken by citizens to register to vote and to fulfill their civic duties. Where relevant data are available, topics are analyzed through the lens of government performance, rather than through the citizen's perspective and experience of the process. For example, the ACE Project's comparative data set analyzes registration systems adopted worldwide and relates them to government performance under three criteria: currency, accurateness, and completeness (ACE: The Electoral Knowledge Network 2013). It does not address the challenges faced by individuals in the context of each registration system, the requirements with which they need to comply, and the eventual burden of participating in democracy.

The selected interactions are seen as the interactions that the majority of citizens need to go through in order to execute their civic responsibilities and to access basic services as defined by the 2004 WDR. A fundamental aspect that was defined in the conceptual phase was the specific scope of each area included in the study. It was decided that only the bureaucratic aspects of each representative process would be studied without addressing issues of service quality as this would require a much more complex approach to data collection. For example, for access to education, Living Life observes how burdensome it can be to enroll a child in school, the required documentation, and the fees charged, but it does not include any measure of quality of the education provided.",

For each area of study and in each country, data would be collected through interviews with several experts who would answer questions about processes and regulations applying to a specific prototypical case (contributor data). Second, data was to be collected through a representative survey of citizens who would answer questions about their own experiences (user data). The objectives were to collect information on both the legal framework (or de jure situation) that the common citizen may not know as well as to assess the actual experience of the users of public services (de facto situation). However, while this represented the optimal approach, the limited budget was insufficient to pilot the user data component. As a result, only the contributor data collection methodology was developed and tested in the pilot.",

The typical timeframe for the relevant tax authority to put in effect a decision on tax appeals ranges from 21 to 90 days, according to an OECD survey of 44 countries, including Chile and India (OECD 2009) . To file an appeal, a taxpayer must submit the required documents within 30 days after a tax notice is received in Ghana and India, and within 90 days in Chile and Vietnam (Table 3. 3). Effective appeal mechanisms also provide for timeliness of appeal decisions. Imposing reasonable time limits to decide on tax appeals is a good practice (Crawford 2013) . Appeal decisions should be made within 30 days in Vietnam, and within 60 days in Ghana and Chile. In contrast, it takes a year for the relevant authority to put in effect a decision on a tax appeal in India. Long time frames for a decision on an appeal not only present uncertainty, but also affect the financial health of a taxpayer. In case of an adverse decision, a taxpayer might incur an excessive expense to pay the penalty as well as interest on any unpaid tax (Crawford 2013) .",

First, the surveys designed for this study attempted to collect data on both the legal/procedural requirements, and the practical side of citizen interaction with governments and services providers. The team concluded that contributor-based data collection is an adequate tool for soliciting responses on legal and procedural regulations, but it does not provide a complete picture of the practical aspects of citizen-government interactions. User experiences vary due to individual circumstances and factors that are not always associated to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to each set of interactions. While contributors can provide accurate information on the legal requirements, documents and procedures undergone by citizens while accessing public services and goods, they cannot represent the variety of experiences faced by different individuals. This was mainly observed while attempting to collect data for areas such as paying taxes, access to health, access to education, and access to utilities. In these areas, the most relevant information regarding interactions lies in the practical experience of respondents rather than on what is written in laws or regulations. Therefore, surveys aimed at collecting data from a representative sample of households would be the optimal approach to retrieve data about citizen-government interactions based on the respondents' own experiences.",

If the correction is minor and does not require printing a new card, the change can be made at the electoral exhibition center.

These services were selected because \"they involve health interventions from which every individual in every country should benefit -no matter what the country's level of socioeconomic development or epidemiological circumstances, and no matter what type of health system it may have -and because recent, comparable data are available for most countries,\" according to the World Health Organization-World Bank first monitoring report on universal health coverage (World Health Organization-World Bank 2015).",

In these three economies, it is not possible to have a skilled birth attendant at the pregnant woman's home at the time of birth, as opposed to in Vietnam where skilled birth attendants are available for home births. No data was collected for Vietnam regarding the cost of having a skilled birth attendant at the time of birth. DTP immunization is mandatory by law in all four economies through their national expanded immunization programs. The World Health Organization recommends 3 initial doses, followed by 3 booster doses that should be administered to children and adolescents with at least 4 years between each booster dose.21    Although all surveyed economies provide the first three doses of DTP immunization for free during the first semester of life, only Chile and India provide subsequent booster doses of the vaccine free of cost.The data on time from initial contact to onset of treatment was provided by a limited number of respondents. As a result, the evidence is not representative of the average citizen experience. The average time in practice reported by contributors to access to antenatal care treatment and to obtain DTP immunization is 2 days in 3 out of 4 pilot economies.

Registrations within one year from the date of a vital event require not only a late fee, but also an affidavit made before a notary public and the written permission of the registrar. In the event that registration is delayed for a period over a year, a magistrate's order is necessary in addition to a fee. Similarly, in Ghana, late registration fees apply if a birth or a death is registered after the legally established time limits.Delayed registration occurring after one year from the date of the event is possible only with a written authority of the registrar per the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 301 from 1965. In contrast, Vietnam does not establish any legal sanctions for non-compliance with the obligation to register a birth and a death. Although the same applies to Chile in case of a birth registration, late death registration is only possible with a court order.When it comes to identification, some countries have general-purpose or foundational national identification documents (NIDs), while others have multiple, purpose-specific or functional IDs such as driver's licenses, voter IDs, or social security cards. Although no standard IDs have been adopted worldwide, there is an agreement that universal coverage is a key principle of any national identification system (World Bank and Center for Global Development 2017). Whereas various forms of identification are accepted as a proof of identity depending on the type of service being accessed in all four economies, India is the only economy where it is not mandatory to have a NID. The Aadhar System, an identification system in place in India since 2009, was introduced to unify civil registration in the economy. It does not replace, however, existing identification documents in India such as the PAN card, passports, driving licenses, etc. Nationality, origin, ethnicity, and marital status of parents should not impact a civil registration process (World Health Organization 2013). In three out of four surveyed economies, a person's place of birth is reflected in the birth certificate but not in the NID, while Chile is the only economy where the place of birth is printed or stored on both birth certificate and national ID card. None of the surveyed economies register or display the parent's marital status in neither of the documents. Out of the four surveyed economies, only Vietnam displays a person's ethnicity on birth certificates and national ID cards. In Vietnam, birth registration rates for children from ethnic minorities are 10% lower than the national average. Although Vietnamese laws do not contain discriminatory provisions based on ethnicity, minorities may fear to disclose sensitive information upon birth registration (UNICEF 2013).",
