Indeed, the expansion in import capacity varies across country groups, and countries receiving less debt relief have been able to expand their import bills by substantially more than countries receiving the bulk of it.

The objectives of the SPA are to ensure that adequate balance of payments finance is available for reform programs and to provide a forum for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of donor assistance for the program. Currently, 32 African countries participate in these activities along with bilateral and multilateral donors. 3 The share of debt owed to official creditors increases from 69 to 72 percent when Nigeria is excluded from the sample, and the share of concessional debt rises from 59 to 71 percent (51 percent of the total).

Thus, if the dynamic trend-the drying up of other financial resources-has been a rationale for the allocation of grants and debt relief, it appears that the relative allocation between the high and low groups has been well implemented. This criteria fails to explain the relative allocation of grants and ODA debt relief between the high and middle groups, however.

Indeed, the ratio of debt to GDP is higher for the high and middle groups than for the low group (see Table 3 ). In addition, countries in the low group have received grants covering 12 -13 percent of their debt stock (nominal); the same ratio for the high and middle groups has been 4-7 percent.

Thus one can argue that if the present value of debt is used as the denominator in the ratios shown in Chart 2, that will further increase the ratio of arrears to debt stock.

More specifically, we define the import bill capacity of recipient countries as follows: trade account deficit plus the difference between imports and exports of services, exclusive of all interest payments, plus the increase in international reserves. This variable, which can be interpreted as the capacity to finance a net transfer of resources from abroad, represents a country's capacity to expand its consumption and investment possibilities beyond its own means. Given the comparatively low levels of per capita income and consumption in Africa (particularly among the countries in our sample), as well as their comparatively low growth rates (Chart 3), it can be argued that an increase in either consumption or investment (which leads to higher economic growth), or both, is clearly welfare enhancing for this group of countries. In measuring the benefits of ODA debt relief we include the change in international reserves even though it is not directly linked to higher consumption and investment. In other words we consider the accumulation of international reserves to be one desirable use of foreign exchange (which needs to be financed) instead of it being a source of funds to finance other needs-such as imports of goods and services. We justify this approach by the low level of international reserves held by the countries considered during the sample period (Table 4) . In fact, developing countries tend to maintain an average stock of foreign reserves in the range of 4-5 months of imports, mainly as a buffer to protect them against short-term liquidity shocks. Assuming that the average stock of foreign reserves held by other developing countries is near the optimum, it appears that African countries need to increase their own holdings, to make themselves less vulnerable to short-term liquidity shocks. Thus increasing African countries' stock of foreign reserves is a desirable (welfare-enhancing) outcome.",

Furthermore, the net transfer from official sources also allowed private creditors to withdraw resources at a rate of about $0.6 billion a year (panel A in Table 5 last column).1 7 It is important to note that, as suggested earlier, ODA debt forgiveness does not necessarily free resources to be used in importing more, and that it could also lead to smaller imports if substitution between ODA debt relief and other net flows takes place. Yet the evidence shown in Chart 4 indicates that the latter has not occurred. Furthermore, Table 5 shows (panel A) that for the sample countries as a group, import capacity increased by 75 percent between 1984-88 and 1989-93, an increase slightly smaller than the one occurring in pure grants during the same period (77 percent), and that in absolute terms the increase in import capacity was larger than the one occurring in pure grants ($3.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively).

Table 6 reports the results of panel data regressions of import capacity on total grants (pure grants plus ODA debt relief), for the sample three groups of countries. The results include a more restrictive model (A), that forces the relationship to be the same for the entire sample period, and less restrictive ones (B and C) that allow for a break-point in 1989, when ODA debt forgiveness began increasing. 2 1 It is important to note that rather than implying any causality running from the independent variable (grants) to the dependent variable (import capacity), as is the case in standard regression analysis, our results are intended to be interpreted just as simple correlations between the variables (for a methodological discussion see Appendix 2). Constants for all countries are not reported because they are of no interest to our analysis. Similarly, results for the less restrictive models are usually reported only when they differ from the results obtained under the more restrictive one. Two main conclusions emerge from Table 6 .22 First, the middle and the low groups are not significantly different from each other from a statistical point of view. That is, in both cases a $1 increase in total grants has been accompanied by a $1 increase in import capacity (the results do not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is the same for both groups). Furthermore, for both groups this result is stable over time; for the low group the estimated coefficient is around 1.3 and significantly different from zero in both 1984-88 and 1989-93, while for the middle group the estimated coefficient is around 1.0 in both periods and also significantly different from zero. Second, for the countries in the high group each $1 of additional grants has been accompanied by $0.36 more imports (this result is significantly different from one in absolute terms). 23 Although a smaller coefficient for this group could have been expected ex-ante based on the fact that debt forgiveness does not necessarily free foreign exchange and therefore may not lead to an improvement in a country's import capacity, the results from the less restrictive model suggest that this weak relationship existed even before the surge in debt forgiveness. Indeed, the relationship appears to be unstable over time: during 1984-88 the point estimate is 0.5 but not significantly different from zero, while during 1989-93 the estimated coefficient becomes 0.4 and significantly different from both zero and one.",

Except in a few cases, this expectation was valid. Table 8 reports the results of regressing import capacity on pure grants for the three country groups. We show only the regression for the entire sample period to illustrate the effect on the coefficients of excluding ODA debt forgiveness from the independent variable; we do not report results that were qualitatively the same as reported in Tables 6 or 7.

Furthermore, the correlation between import capacity and pure grants is not even statistically significant (when using total grants it is statistically significant only during 1989-93, when ODA debt forgiveness surged).

In fact, the ODA debt relief variable turned out to be insignificant for all groups except the low group, but this result appears to be spurious in the sense that when adding pure grants to the same regression ODA debt forgiveness becomes insignificant.

In particular, as suggested by some of the results above, it could be that on an incremental basis, the high group gets additional funding from different sources along with the increase in ODA debt forgiveness. This possibility is analyzed further in Tables 9 and 10. The results in Table 9 , when compared with those in Table 7 , show that for the high group total grants are more significantly and positively correlated to multilateral net lending than pure grants, especially during 1989-93 ($0.06 per $1 of additional grants, with a marginal significance level-one-tail--of 9 percent; see Table 7 , last column). This result is consistent with the hypothesis posed above, that as the debt burden is lessened by ODA debt forgiveness by bilateral donors, multilateral net flows tend to increase (either through increases in disbursements or decreases in repayments). Finally, Table 10 shows that substitution between bilateral net flows and ODA debt forgiveness occurred during 1989-93 for all the countries except those in the middle group. In particular, for the low group $1 of ODA debt relief was matched with a decrease of about $1 in new bilateral net transfers, although this drop was offset by an increase in private net transfers of about the same amount (not reported in the table). More important, for the high group this substitution has been only partial: $1 in ODA debt relief has been accompanied by a decrease in bilateral net transfers of only $0.105, and this drop was more than fully offset by an increase in multilateral net transfers of $0.126. This offsetting result suggests the possibility that countries in the high group have been able to finance a larger import bill in recent years, and on an incremental basis, mainly because multilateral sources have made up for the decrease in new financing from bilateral sources, which, in turn, are partially substituting debt relief for new lending.",

Furthermore, during 1989-93 multilateral lending replaced the decrease in bilateral lending which, in turn, was caused by an increase in grants. This paper must be understood as a first and very simple attempt to measure the benefits accruing to low-income countries when receiving grants and, in particular, bilateral ODA debt relief. The analysis is limited in several respects because it fails to touch on many related issues that need to be explored, such as the long-term effects of debt relief on country creditworthiness. This and other aspects of the problem should be the subject of future research.",

The question here, then, is whether it makes any difference if these countries are analyzed in per capita terms.When grants are measured in per capita terms, the results are the opposite of the one discussed in the text, which concludes that grants have been allocated to richer countries. In fact, the poorest countries have received, in per capita terms, about 67 percent or more pure grants than the richer countries. Furthermore, this inequality increased marginally from 67 percent to 68 percent between 1984-88 and 1989-93 (Table  A1 .1).This allocation of grants per capita implies that grants have come to compensate, at least partially, for the initial inequality that exists in per capita GNP between the high and low country groups.

Nigeria's average GDP ($35 billion during 1989-93) is more than three times the size of the next largest economy in the SPA group, CMte d'lvoire ($9.8 billion), and its exports account for about 36 percent of the 32 SPA countries' total exports .Nigeria is also a clear outlier in terms of its capacity to extend its import bill through total grants (in the whole series). When total grants are regressed against import bill capacity (R 2 of 0.8337), Nigeria is a strong anomaly. Chart A4. 1 shows the residual plot from the regression placing Nigeria at the very end of observations. It is clear from this chart that Nigeria creates the most and the only major noise in this regression. Thus, in order to have more robust results, Nigerian observations were eliminated from the sample when we reported the effect of grants on import bill capacity, as well as when we ran grants (both total and pure) versus various dependent variables in two periods. Appendix 5: ODA Debt Forgiveness and Import Capacity Table A5 .1 shows the results of regressing import capacity, first on ODA debt forgiveness for all the countries in the sample (excluding Nigeria) and second on both ODA debt forgiveness and pure grants, during 1989-93. As expected, the results validate the findings reported in the paper, that is, ODA debt relief neither allows countries to import more nor curtails their capacity to do so.
