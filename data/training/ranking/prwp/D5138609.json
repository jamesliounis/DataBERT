There are around twelve hundred microfinance institutions (MFI) in Bangladesh (CDF 2002) but the industry is dominated by four large MFIs (BRAC, Grameen, ASA and Proshika) that serve around 11.4 million or ninety percent of all clients. Table 1 illustrates the scale of these institutions. These four institutions combined have over $800 million in outstanding loans and around $380 million in savings. The differences between the number of borrowers and members reflect differences in the variety of services offered by these MFIs. Proshika and BRAC offer a range of services to their members, while Grameen and ASA focus on the provision of microfinance services.",

As such, the experiences of scaling-up discussed here draw primarily upon these large MFIs. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2.0. describes the evolution of the microfinance industry over the past three decades in Bangladesh. Section 3.0. proposes several factors that contributed to its scaling-up. Section 4.0. summarizes the evidence on the impact of microfinance on poverty, vulnerability and female empowerment. Section 5.0. concludes by discussing key lessons from the Bangladesh experience.",

        "text": "The growth in access to credit by the poor took place in several distinct phases over the last three decades. The origins of the current microcredit model can be traced back to action-research in the late 1970s, carried out by academics as well as practioners in organizations that were created to deal with the relief and rehabilitation needs of post-independence Bangladesh. The 1980s witnessed a growing number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which experimented with different modalities of delivering credit to the poor. The various models converged in the beginning of the 1990s toward a fairly uniform 'Grameen-model' of delivering microcredit. It sparked a sharp growth in access to microcredit during this decade. In recent years the standard Grameen-model has undergone more refinements in order to cater to different niche markets as well as to different life-cycle circumstances.",

        "text": "Experimentation in providing credit to households considered 'unbankable' by the formal financial system has its origins a few years after Bangladesh's independence war in 1971. The independence movement gave rise to a new generation of young activists who were keen on contributing to the reconstruction of this war-ravaged country. The new government and a myriad of aid agencies that arrived on the scene were unable to cope with the scale of destitution and non-governmental organizations emerged to meet the challenges. The early years of the NGO movement in Bangladesh focused on relief and rehabilitation with an emphasis on community development. However, by the mid-1970s, two of the NGOs that would subsequently expand in scale, BRAC and Proshika, found that 'elite capture' was a serious impediment to their development objectives. As a result, a separate focus on the poor through a 'target-group' approach was introduced. Moreover, an ideological debate within both these organizations began to brew, between those who favored 'economic tools' (credit, savings etc) to support poverty reduction and those who believed that social mobilization against existing injustices would suffice and financial services were unnecessary.",

Several of these small 'peer monitoring groups' were organized into a larger unit which would meet weekly with the primary purpose of repaying loan installments. The process of trial and error included combining males and females in the same credit group and then changing this to separate groups divided by gender. It also included forming 'occupational groups' but this was dropped in favor of village-based groups. The demand for loans grew rapidly and Professor Yunus enlisted the support of the Bangladesh Bank and commercial banks to provide the 'Grameen Project' -as it was then called -with resources. The success of this experimentation paved the way for the establishment of the Grameen Bank under a special ordinance in 1983.",

One important mode tested was the efficacy of providing loans for group projects compared to offering loans to individuals with peer monitoring. The broad lesson was that the latter was more effective due to incentives and 'free-rider' problems compared with lending to a group. Hence by the late 1980s the predominant model became one of providing individual loans to a target group of poor households, with peer monitoring and strong MFI staff follow-up.",

What is particularly interesting is that the development of the know-how and confidence to implement large programs arose, in some cases, from the experience of scaling-up programs not related to microcredit. For instance in the case of BRAC, the first major experience with a nationwide program came about when it implemented an oral rehydration program to combat diarrhoeal disease. Thirteen million women were trained to use a simple but effective rehydration solution and BRAC staff were paid based on how many of their trainees used and retained this knowledge 3 .",

The growth was fueled largely by a 'franchising approach' whereby new branches replicated the procedures and norms that prevailed in existing branches. The product that was offered to the client at the time was fairly narrow, focusing mainly on a standard microcredit package offered to all clients. The view was that it was easier to recruit new staff and train them quickly in a simple product during a phase when branches were opened at a rapid rate. This growth was clearly aided by the high population density and relative ethnic, social and cultural homogeneity in Bangladesh. almost all (92%) provide micro-credit as one of these services -the other common services are health, sanitation, education services that are provided by around half of the sampled NGOs (Gauri and Galef 2004) .",

These loans typically range from 20,000 taka (around $320) to 200,000 taka ($3,200) . Innovative solutions are also emerging to address the problem of access to finance for the small enterprise sector.

Leadership skills were instrumental at the initial stages in persuading a skeptical public that providing credit to the poor could become a viable and replicable proposition. These skills were equally important during the process of scaling-up. These included being able to recruit and motivate staff, decentralizing authority away from the center, building management information systems and internal controls as well as having the humility to learn from mistakes. Moreover, once the leaders of these organizations showed that scaling up is possible, this view became part of the staff culture and other staff had the confidence to expand the programs within their own jurisdiction.",

A critical element in this process is an objective performance evaluation system for staff that is linked to career mobility and a myriad of other incentives for staff to perform well both individually and in their teams. For instance Grameen Bank has introduced a system of rating branch offices based on the achievement of specific targets which not only include standard loan recovery, but also factor in social indicators such as the proportion of Grameen children going to school. Staff motivation is also enhanced by decentralizing significant amounts of responsibility to the lower tiers of the administrative structure. ASA is the best example of a lean credit delivery structure with high levels of decision-making authority given to field offices, from loan sanctioning decisions to staff human resource issues. Moreover, the structure within field offices is relatively flat with a branch manager who works with individual fieldworkers to resolve problems and typically shares living quarters with other field staff (Jain and Moore 2003) .

Donors also formed a 'consortium' that pooled funds, negotiated jointly with BRAC and had common reporting requirements.

A less charitable view is that the scaling up of NGOs went largely unnoticed and once this took place the combined clout of large NGOs and donors has led to the Government taking on a largely laissez-faire approach. Ultimately the relationship between Government and NGOs also depends on individual personalities and social ties (Hossain 2003) Looking forward, it is clear that both the overall umbrella legislation governing NGO activities and the regulatory framework for microfinance need to be strengthened, particularly in light of the large amounts of deposits mobilized for the poor.

It is also striking how in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt and certain other Muslim countries, MFIs have found religion to be a factor that has led to a relatively lower demand for microcredit and MFIs that are more cautious about expanding 7 .

For instance, data collected by the World Bank in 1992 have been used to show widely varying results depending on the methodology chosen to assess impact. Khandker (1998) estimates that for every 100 taka lent to a woman, household consumption increases by 18 taka; interestingly the figure is 11 taka if the same amount was lent to a man. Moderate poverty falls by around 15% and ultra-poverty by 25% for households who have been BRAC members for up to three years controlling for other factors according to the author. Similar results are found for Grameen Bank and Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) members. On the other hand, using the same data and a different way of correcting for selectivity bias, Morduch (1998) finds that microcredit does not have a significant impact on consumption levels and therefore on income poverty. Consumption data from 1,072 households in one district of Bangladesh are used to show that the largest effect on poverty occurs when a moderate-poor BRAC client borrows more than 10,000 taka ($200) in cumulative loans (Zaman 1998) . In other words, there may be a threshold level of credit above which a household gains most in terms of increases in income.",

Somewhat surprisingly, the impact appears to be greater for households who started off extremely poor (18 percentage point drop in extreme poverty in seven years) compared to moderate poor households (8.5 percentage point drop). These results differ from earlier evidence that pointed to moderate poor borrowers benefiting more than extremely poor borrowers due to the fact that the poorest have a number of constraints (fewer income sources, worse health and education etc) which prevent them from investing the loan in a high-return activity (Wood and Sharif 1997) . This feature of better-off households benefiting more was also borne out by detailed case-study evidence (Farashuddin et al 1998) and by comparing participants of credit programs who cater to different socio-economic groups (Montgomery et al 1996) 10 . 9 The methodological problems associated with impact assessment of microcredit are complex. The literature typically uses 'control groups', usually 'eligible non-members' or 'recently joined members' in order to address the problem of the counter-factual. There have been attempts to cater for the 'selectivity bias' problem but with varying degrees of success. 10 Montgomery et al compare the performance of BRAC borrowers with the borrowers from a Governmentrun microcredit scheme, the Thana Resource Development and Employment Programme (TRDEP). TRDEP's borrowers' initial endowment conditions is shown to be higher than BRAC's (average pre-loan landholding is 46 and 30 decimals for TRDEP and BRAC members respectively and the percentage of The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) carried out an extensive study of the impact of PKSF POs microcredit program using longitudinal data of 3000 households between 1997-2000. One of the key findings was that 'microcredit has a positive and significant effect on poverty status of the program households\u2026.' (BIDS 2001 page 155) . The study also finds that microcredit members are less vulnerable when struck by crises. Moreover improvements in other social indicators (child immunization, use of sanitary latrines, contraceptive prevalence) are also more noticeable for microcredit program members compared to non-members.",

Goetz et al (1996) On the whole, the evidence presented by those who argue that microcredit improves female status within a household appears more convincing than that argued by the 'skeptics' camp. There are two main reasons for this contention. First the underlying thread of the 'positive' argument, that access to an important household resource (credit) enhances a female's status within the household is both intuitively appealing and resonates with the theoretical literature on bargaining models of the household (Lundberg and Pollack 1993) . Secondly, the focus on female control over loans as a key component of the 'skeptics' argument fails to recognize that credit enters the overall household income pool and that household members jointly participate in the loan investment. The role of several family members in managing the loan-financed investment is now explicitly recognized by MFIs who now give loans to women for \"male-activities\" such as rickshaw loans, that many did not permit in earlier days.",

A critical part is maintaining a stable macro-economic environment with both interest rates and inflation kept at reasonable levels. The lack of macro-stability has seriously constrained the growth of microfinance in several countries, e.g. Malawi. Government regulations and policies are also crucial in creating the appropriate environment for the growth of the sector. These policies need to strike a balance between protecting the interests of depositors in microfinance institutions that collect savings, and not regulating the sector excessively with unnecessary red tape. The scaling up in Bangladesh benefited significantly from good communications networks -hence government investments in road networks is important to reduce the transaction costs of microcredit.",

These interventions may be particularly appropriate for the poorest households, which face the greatest risks of income fluctuations and have the greatest need for a range of financial and non-financial services. Moreover, while the provision of microcredit can enhance a woman's status in the eyes of other household members, social mobilization and legal education interventions in conjunction with credit are likely to have a more significant effect than credit alone. However this does not imply that microfinance institutions ought to provide these services. In many cases organizations may prefer to specialize in providing microfinance and facilitate linkages to providers of other non-credit interventions.",

However, apex bodies are not a panacea and a rigorous analysis of the underlying retail capacity and demand for funds needs to be carried out before they are established. The Bangladesh experience suggests that if an apex is to contribute significantly to scaling up, then it needs to ensure that the flow of funds is synchronized with the needs of growing MFIs, that it should have clear requirements for MFIs to implement solid business plans and that it should not overburden MFIs with high transaction costs.",

Hence another lesson from the Bangladesh experience could be that it is not necessarily a sound strategy to support many different institutions, and risk spreading resources thinly, in order to reach large numbers of poor people. This is particularly important in light of the fact that the leadership skills and professional capacity required to go to scale are in limited supply in most countries. However, this needs to be balanced by the risks of having a concentrated market structure such as the industry-wide consequences of poor performance within one institution. A related point is that the 'franchising' model of setting up virtually identical field offices was possible due to the relatively simple credit delivery system that was offered at the time. The introduction of more diversified products, catering to different niche markets, was only introduced after the rapid expansion phase slowed down. This deliberate sequencing strategy for scaling up services is a notable lesson from the Bangladesh experience.",

        "text": "Effective internal controls are also important in ensuring effective staff performance. First of all the fact that financial transactions are carried out publicly, in the weekly meetings and in the branch offices, is a major check against any form of discretionary behavior by fieldworkers.Many NGOs, particularly the ones that have successfully expanded in scale, have developed measures that include frequently rotating staff within and between branches, regular field visits by senior management, a strong internal audit team and annual external audits.A fundamental part of the scaling up of Bangladesh's NGOs and more specifically the microfinance movement, has been the ability to learn from experiences and adapt programs accordingly. This learning process takes place both through informal feedback by field staff during regular interactions with management as well as through a formal monitoring and evaluation process. BRAC's Research and Evaluation Division has around twenty professionals whose key function is to evaluate BRAC's multi-dimensional programs and give timely feedback to program staff and management. This process of feedback occurs through longer-term research as well as 'quick-turnaround' assessments. The shift to more flexible financial services that took place in recent years is largely based on adapting to client feedback and analysis of the limitations of a uniform microcredit model. Many of these lessons have also been shared with the rest of the microfinance industry as there are many examples of smaller MFIs being managed by former employees of the large MFIs.A constructive donor-client relationshipExternal resources played an important part in the experimentation process, subsequent growth in outreach and institutional strengthening of the microfinance industry. At the same time, the large microfinance institutions have been successful in 'managing donors'.Northern NGOs, such as the Ford Foundation, Oxfam and the Aga Khan Foundation, played an important role at the initial stages of the NGO-MFI industry in Bangladesh. The subsequent expansion and consolidation stage was funded largely by official bilateral agencies 6 and later by multilateral agencies once Northern NGOs could not match the growing resource requirements of the larger MFIs. A large part of these donor investments went to the capitalization of MFIs loan funds, crucial to the rapid expansion that took place in the 1990s, as well as into developing institutional capacity through management information systems and human resource development. Finally, the 1990s have seen dependence on donor resources progressively declining for the large MFIs",

        "text": "as there have always been widely varying views regarding NGOs within the civil service and the Cabinet. Individuals in key positions within Government have time and again proved instrumental in facilitating the growth of the microcredit sector. The early development of the Grameen project, its registration as a bank and the decision to grant it managerial autonomy are clear examples (Yunus 1999), as was the establishment of PKSF with a strong autonomous board. The prevailing consensus position is supportive of NGOs though accusations of involvement in party politics by a handful of NGOs has strained the overall Government-NGO relationship of late.",

Their investigation of loan histories led the authors to conclude that 'About 63 percent of the cases fall into the three categories of partial, very limited or no control indicating a fairly significant pattern of loss of direct control over credit' . The authors disaggregated their data in terms of loan activity and concluded that investing in traditional women's work increased their chances of being able to control the loan. Montgomery et al (1996) also have reservations about the 'empowering effect' of microcredit. Their argument is based largely on secondary sources and a small field survey focusing on the issue of control over loans. Whilst the authors admit that their sample is small, they on balance support Goetz et al's (op.cit) view that microcredit reinforces existing gender patterns and inequalities by promoting traditional income generation activities, which they believe do little to alter the social status quo.",
