        "text": "The recent literature on forced migration has largely focused on measuring the economic impact of refugees on host countries. 1 However, an important factor that shapes this impact is refugees' self-selection through return migration. An expansive literature on temporary (voluntary) migration has shown that ignoring this selection can distort the assessment of migrants' assimilation profiles and, by corollary, their economic impact. 2 This line of work has also revealed important properties of return decisions but only that of economic migrants. We now know that refugees are distinct in many ways, including their human capital investments and dynamic earnings profiles while in the destination country, which is often attributed to differences in their subjective return probability (Cortes (2004) and Galor and Stark (1991) ). In this paper, we bring together these two strands of literature by analyzing the return decisions of 2.16 million Syrian refugees who were displaced between January 2011 and March 2018.",

The outflow of refugees peaked in 2013, but never ceased completely. In the meantime, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 103,090 -about 1.8 percent -were verified to return to the Syrian Arab Republic by mid-2018, the end point of our analysis. 3 Our sample covers those refugees registered by UNHCR in the Middle East and North Africa Region (excluding Turkey and European countries), including returnees and those who stayed.",

However, an inherent challenge in the literature on conflict and forced migration is the absence of a complete longitudinal data set for conditions in countries of asylum and origin that can be mapped onto refugee characteristics. Establishing causality is even more challenging. We make progress on the first part by combining different sources and types of data. For demographic characteristics of refugees and their arrival and return information, we use administrative data from the Profile Global Registration System (ProGres) database of UNHCR. For the conditions faced by refugees in exile, we use vulnerability surveys conducted by UN agencies in Jordan and Lebanon, and complement these with a new household survey comprising similar demographic and socioeconomic modules but also including vignettes about the drivers of return. Finally, for conditions in Syria, we have compiled a novel monthly conflict events data set to use along with nighttime light emissions data that proxies access to utilities.",

First, we exploit the temporal and spatial variation of the nightlights and conflict events series to build a sub-district-month panel for conditions inside Syria. This is used to analyze the impact of changes in conflict and luminosity patterns on return in an aggregate manner using ordinary least squares (OLS) and Poisson quasi maximum likelihood (PQML) count models. Second, we use the detailed information on refugee characteristics provided by ProGres together with conditions in countries of asylum, 4 to analyze individual return decisions. Given that we have arrival and -where applicable -return dates for each refugee, we can study their likelihood of return for a given month using both discrete and continuous time proportional hazard models, such as the complementary log-log model (cloglog) and Cox proportional hazard model (Cox), respectively. This helps to deal with the right-censored nature of the return problem.",

A one standard deviation improvement in security (measured by the change in a composite Conflict Events Index (CEI) 5 between the previous two quarters) increases returns by 6 percent when using the PQML model. Improved access to electricity (measured at the refugee's home sub-district level), and by extension utilities, also encourages returns. In particular, a one standard deviation improvement in luminosity (measured analogously to the CEI, comparing changes between the previous two quarters) increases returns by 3.8 percent. Overall, the conditions in Syria have the expected signs aligned with the risk-adjusted expected payoff-based explanations in standard models of migration (e.g., Sjaastad (1962) and Borjas (1987) ).",

Our results paint a complex picture of the decision-making process underlying the spontaneous return behavior of refugees. Not only the individual characteristics of a refugee, but also the social structure surrounding her can shape the likelihood of return. For example, generally the likelihood of return increases dramatically with age. In terms of social structure, a refugee who is a member of the immediate and extended family of the principal applicant has a considerably higher hazard rate than the principal applicant's spouse. These patterns are further sensitive to the conditions in Syria (i.e. conflict intensity), particularly for men. These results are consistent with international experience, which suggests that individual family members -often single, older men -return to the country of origin first to assess the situation on the ground, while the remainder of the family remains in exile (World Bank, 2019) .",

We find similar, but less robust, results for refugees with better housing conditions.",

        "text": "Our results and analysis are closely linked with the literature on the economic analysis of forced displacement. This literature includes a rapidly growing number of works that consider the effects of forced migration on locals in the following areas: employment, wage, entrepreneurship and consumption (Braun and Kvasnicka (2014); Moser et al. (2014) ; Ruiz and Vargas-Silva (2015) ; Borjas and Monras (2017) ; Tumen (2016) ; and Alix-Garcia et al. (2018)), the incidence of crime and hostility, (Bell et al. (2013) ; Hangartner et al. (2019) ), and electoral outcomes (Dustmann et al. (2019) ). These papers, however, do not consider the return dynamics of refugees. The omission of positive or negative self-selection of refugees through return migration can potentially distort impact and economic performance assessments as shown by Abramitzky et al. (2014) in the case of economic migration patterns during the Age of Mass Migration in the United States. A limited number of other papers, e.g. Cattaneo and Peri (2016) and Clemens (2017) , consider endogenous displacement driven by climate and violence shocks, but they do not analyze return migration.",

An important share of this work focuses on the differences between the economic behavior of those migrants who intend to return and those who do not. Galor and Stark (1990) and Borjas and Bratsberg (1996) argue, respectively, that a positive probability (or intention) of future return to home country leads to higher savings and higher labor force participation among migrants. Bauer and Sinning (2011) and Dustmann (1997) provide empirical evidence for these arguments using migrant savings and labor force participation data from Germany, respectively. Bijwaard and Wahba (2014) compare the return trends of migrants in the Netherlands and show that the effect of host-country income on propensity of return migration is U-shaped, with migrants from low and high income groups being more likely to return. Gibson and McKenzie (2011) use a cross-section survey of top high-school performers of cohorts from 1976 to 2004 in Tonga, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand to assess the determinants of migration and return decisions. For this group, return is found to be primarily linked to family and lifestyle reasons rather than wage differentials across countries.",

However, these are probably driven by different mechanisms. To elaborate on this point, we use a simple migration model to show that for Syrian refugees, most of whom live near subsistence level, the costs associated with return could be prohibitive. In this case, a permanent improvement in host country conditions has two effects on the comparison of expected lifetime utility across return and stay options. First, it reduces the opportunity cost of the return decision. Second, it makes the return option less attractive as the gap between future utilities in return and no-return scenarios decreases with a higher permanent income in exile. For initially high income levels, with a small increase in income, the second effect dominates and return becomes less attractive. In contrast, when starting from an income that is too close to the return cost, a small increase in income relaxes the opportunity cost of return drastically, which dominates the second effect and makes return more attractive.",

Despite the seemingly improving economic conditions, however, the social unrest escalated rapidly and by mid-2011 a full-scale armed conflict was already unfolding. Since then, the conflict has led to more than 400,000 directly conflict-induced fatalities and millions of indirect casualties, often by means of severe deprivation.",

The average returnee from Lebanon remained in the country of asylum for about 1.5 years more than peers from Iraq and 10 months longer than those from Jordan.

Those who intend to return may have systematically different tendencies in reporting. It is possible that those who plan to return no longer feel the need to mis-report their income, and this would generate a bias in the correlation between the return decision and asylum country conditions. We attempt to solve this problem in two ways. First, we exploit the fact that we observe whether refugees return to Syria for 1-3 years after the survey data was collected. We can therefore remove the responses from cases who ultimately return when aggregating the data to the district and governorate levels. This should at least keep the reporting bias constant across geographic areas.

This allows us to differentiate between different types of conflict events while assessing the impact on the return decisions of refugees: a priori, some conflict events, like chemical attacks, are expected to pose a greater deterrent to return than others. Such decomposition of conflict events also helps us to reduce potential endogeneity concerns between return and the proxies of conflict intensity, e.g., casualties.

This is equivalent to an increase in their respective hazard rate of 77% and 118% relative to the omitted category of refugee ages 15-44 years. Both coefficients are precisely estimated. As this section of the paper is descriptive, we cannot give a reason for this finding. We provide two possibilities to consider. One possible explanation for this result is that the younger cohort is at a greater risk of being conscripted by the Syrian army for compulsory or reserve military service, which applies to men ages 18-42 and has been used in a discretionary manner throughout the conflict. Table 7 , which reports results separately for women and men in columns (2) and 3, respectively, confirms this result for men, but also shows a similar pattern for female adults. A second possible explanation that particularly applies to women is that older age cohorts are more likely to be unemployed, which could increase their hazard rate of return (World Bank (2020)).",

The hazard rate is greater for men in the multivariate regression, in contrast to the simple plots we showed in section 4.1.2. 18 The highly significant coefficient estimate of 0.38 suggests that the hazard rate for men is 45% higher than for women. Moreover, the relationship of the refugee to the principal applicant of the case matters. That is, adult immediate and extended family members, such as siblings, aunts and uncles, have considerably higher hazard rates than the principal applicant's spouse. The hazard rate is also higher for singles compared to married refugees (60%), a result that is precisely estimated. In contrast, widowed refugees have a 24% lower hazard rate (also significant at the 1 percent level). These findings are in line with international experience (World Bank (2017)), which suggests that return happens in stages, with individual family members -often single adult males -returning to the country of origin to assess the situation on the ground, while the rest of the case remains in the country of asylum. Appendix figure A1 suggests that more educated refugees make more income while in asylum. These differences in return hazard could also be driven by differences in wealth (e.g., more-skilled people may have more savings as suggested by Appendix Figure A1) or lower transaction costs (e.g., more-skilled people better communicate/navigate in host communities).

An important revelation of this literature, the planned adaptation of economic actions in anticipation of return or settlement, has been shown to differentiate various migrant groups. These adaptations can take place in terms of savings (Galor and Stark (1991) ), labor force participation (Borjas and Bratsberg (1996) ), or human capital accumulation (Dustmann et al. (2011) ). Thus, a two-way determination between returns and economic conditions is likely. Our data and empirical setting are not rich enough to fully identify such mechanisms in the case of Syrian refugees. Nevertheless, the positive association between the return of refugees and their conditions in host countries is a curious phenomenon. The vulnerability assessments (VASyr and VAF), reveal extreme coping strategies among refugees which are resorted to support a bare bones living standard, with no surplus to be saved or used for additional schooling.",

While it is not possible to detect or estimate such costs and incomes by using our data set, a descriptive literature on the rules and regulations governing the return of Syrian refugees provides ample facts in support of the transportation cost argument. For instance, about 70 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan are reported to lack basic civil documentation, which is required for returns (Norwegian Refugee Council, 2017).",

First, it reduces the opportunity cost of the return decision, i.e., decreasing own consumption by a given amount (\u03c4 ) is easier when the first-period income is greater. Second, it makes the return option less attractive as the gap between second period utilities in return and no-return scenarios decreases with a higher w i . When the initial income is high, i.e., w i \u2192 \u221e, the second effect dominates following a small increase in w i and return becomes less attractive. In contrast, starting from an income that is too close to \u03c4 , i.e., w i \u2192 \u03c4 , a small increase in income relaxes the opportunity cost of returning drastically, which dominates the second effect.

Our analysis with novel subdistrict-month panel data shows that better security and improved access to utilities, as proxied by nightlight luminosity, at the location of origin increase the likelihood of return. This result is aligned with the risk-adjusted expected payoff-based explanations of standard models of migration. However, we provide evidence that worse conditions in exile do not always induce more returns to the origin country. In certain aspects, such as access to food, poor conditions reduce the likelihood of return. In discussing these results, we propose a simple framework where an increase in income in exile can trigger return for those with low income in the presence of mobility costs.",

The majority of principal applicants are male, and principal applicants are less likely to return. Men are typically household heads in this culture. It is therefore not obvious if we want to average out the role of other characteristics -which are intrinsically correlated with gender -when looking at the role of gender in the decision to return.

The first panel shows the payoffs associated with not returning (W nr N C ), which are identical regardless of mobility costs, and the payoffs for a returning refugee with (W r C ) and without (W r N C ) mobility costs. Inclusion of a mobility cost makes the return payoff steeper than the staying payoff for low income levels. As a result, as shown in the second panel, whereas the gain from return is a monotonically decreasing function of the host country income in the case with no mobility costs (\u2206 r N C ), it becomes nonmonotonous in the case with mobility costs (\u2206 r C ). As a result, for low income levels, a small increase in host country income can make return more desirable. In fact, for some ranges of v i and \u03c4 , a double crossing of the stay payoff and return payoff streams is also possible. In that case, only refugees with an intermediate income range would return as Bijwaard and Wahba (2014) find for economic migrants.",
