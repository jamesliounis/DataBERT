This attention is motivated, in part, by the fact that self-control problems appear common in developed economies, and there is no reason to think that the very poor would be immune. The new focus on self-control is also motivated by evidence that people often fail to execute their stated plans for important intertemporal choices. For example, when we asked farmers in Malawi how much fertilizer they planned to use in the upcoming planting season, a large majority (85%) said they planned to use some. Eight months later, when we asked them how much they actually used, half said they used less than they had planned; and most of those used less than half of what they planned. In addition, a growing literature shows substantial demand for, and consequences of, commitment devices designed to overcome problems of self-control. 2 In this paper, we investigate several potential sources of failure to pursue what appear to be individually optimal intertemporal choices. More specifically, we study the reasons why, after 2 they make choices about future consumption, people often want to revise those choices. The paper makes two contributions. First, we test for the presence of self-control problems using a novel and robust method. Second, we provide a quantitative analysis of this and other motives for the adjustment of prior choices.",

This modeling strategy is founded, in part, on evidence of non-constant time discounting. Several studies can be interpreted to show that time discount rates decline as tradeoffs are pushed into the temporal distance. 3 In particular, many of experimental studies document \"static\" preference reversals: under commitment, subjects choose the larger and later of two rewards when both are distant in time, but prefer the smaller and earlier one as both rewards draw nearer to the present.",

Most important, when utility is time-separable, present-biased time discounting implies time-inconsistency; the choices (plans) that a person makes now about consumption at a later date are different from the choices she would make when that date arrives. Self-control problems and a demand for commitment may thus emerge. The important consequences of this time-inconsistency have been studied in many different contexts. 4 While the study of self-control problems emerging from (quasi-) hyperbolic time discounting is now voluminous, gaps remain. Most relevant for this paper, there is to our knowledge no direct field evidence that static preference reversals are associated with time-inconsistency. Indeed, other than Halevy (2011) , who performed a classroom-based study with approximately 150 college students, there have been no lab or field studies where the revision of previous decisions is the dependent variable of interest. Instead, prior work has either studied the static preference reversals themselves, the stability of time preferences, or the relationship between static preference reversals and the demand for commitment. 5",

In addition, some static preference reversals may reflect inattention, confusion about tradeoffs, or responses to perceived experimenter demands. 8 It is unclear whether consumers who make such choices under commitment would also tend to revise them later if the commitment is relaxed. Furthermore, even if preferences under commitment were well-described by changing time discount rates, the simple act of making a plan may importantly limit what would otherwise be important problems of self-control. 9 Concerns about self-image and the importance of following through might trump the effects of changing time discount rates. In this case, again, static preference reversals under commitment would not predict time-inconsistent behavior.",

In this paper, we examine three additional determinants of revision. The first is social pressure: the influence of spouses, relatives, and others in one's social network. Especially in rural communities, individuals in developing countries are often obliged to share their income with relatives and friends, 10 and such pressure may be an important factor behind the revision of previous decisions and an apparent inability to pursue privately optimal choices. 11 Second, shocks such as deaths, illness, or unexpected changes in income could change the optimal time path of consumption, making revisions desirable. Third, individuals could make mistakes in their original decisions, and seek to revise them upon realizing the error.",

Most directly, this understanding is crucial for the design and welfare analysis of commitment devices. If social pressure affects revision, then this may reveal an additional benefit of commitment devices: preventing future plans from being subverted or undone by others who may have different preferences. 12 If shocks drive revision, policy-makers must confront the important cost that commitment devices can impose by reducing individuals' abilities to deal with the unexpected (cf. Amador et al., 2006) . If mistakes are an important source of revisions, then this may also mean that commitment devices can be harmful, as mistakes cannot later be corrected. Thus, if social pressure, shocks, or mistakes turn out to be important determinants of revisions, then commitment devices could be designed either to shield resources from one's social network, while maintaining access for oneself, or to allow access in the case of emergency or verifiable error.",

Individual subjects chose an allocation of money to be disbursed at two points, 61 and 5 91 days, in the future. 13 A subset of these subjects were revisited some time prior to t=61 and given the opportunity to revise the allocation between t=61 and t=91.

Each choice was an allocation of an endowment between two periods, one \"sooner\" and one \"later.\" Participants were paid a return on the part of the endowment that was saved for later. Each participant made 10 allocation choices: one choice for each of five different rates of return in two different time frames, one in the near future (the \"near\" time frame) and one in the more distant future (the \"far\" time frame). Choices regarding the near time frame allocated money between tomorrow and 30 days from tomorrow. Choices regarding the far period allocated money between 60 days and 90 days from tomorrow.

We made the first attempt to revisit each respondent on the date implied by the randomly-assigned target lag. In some cases, the actual lag was smaller (closer to the disbursement date) than the targeted lag, because some farmers could not immediately be located and had to be found thereafter. The actual lag is, as expected, highly correlated with the target lag; the correlation coefficient is 0.99. 84.9% of respondents were revisited with exactly the targeted lag, and 97.4% were revisited no more than two days after their target date. The maximum difference in the sample between target lag and actual lag is six days. Actual lags spanned the range of 16 to one days prior to first disbursement.",

However, because the original allocation is set out just next to new allocation, there should be no difficulty replicating the original allocation and perhaps some mild, but implicit encouragement to do so.

Table 4 shows the results of a regression of the difference between the natural log of the allocation to sooner and later on the rate of return r and observable characteristics of the participants. These results provide some evidence that, conditional on the rate of return, those with more wealth at baseline allocate more to later, as do those with more relatives who live in the village. There is also some weak evidence that those who scored higher on the word recall test and the financial literacy questions allocate more of their endowment to later, but that those who score higher on the Raven's test allocate less of their endowment to later.

The results indicate that the coefficient on the indicator for days to first disbursement less than or equal to six in Table 6 is robust to a wide range of assumptions on attriter revisions, except when attriter revision is assumed to be as much as -600: in this case the coefficient declines enough in magnitude to become statistically insignificant.

The early contributions to this literature assumed that time discount rates were constant with respect to time.

Low-income farmers can go hungry for long periods if they fail to make good smoothing decisions. They can fail to rise out of extreme poverty if they miss opportunities to make high return investments. We conducted an experiment among Malawian farmers to investigate why their intertemporal choices may appear not to serve their individual self-interest. More precisely, we provide the first field evidence on the causes and correlates of decisions to revise prior intertemporal choices. The experiment allowed subjects to make an intertemporal allocation of substantial funds they would receive at two future times 30 days apart. This future 30-day period was timed to occur during a period of low income and low food stores, and thus consumption smoothing of substantial amounts of future income is very difficult. Several weeks later, prior to the first disbursal of funds, we revisited study participants and allowed them to revise their previous allocations over the same 30-day period. We examine these revisions of allocations for evidence of self-control problems as well as other potential mechanisms behind intertemporal choice revision.",

In contrast to pre-existing work on demand for commitment devices, our approach has the advantage of allowing even na\u00efve individuals (who are not aware of their self-control problems) to contribute to estimates, since na\u00efve as well as sophisticated respondents can display revision behavior.

By providing evidence of the relative importance of time-inconsistency, the results support the view that, if we privilege an individual's preferences at moments relatively far from the present, the benefits of commitment may be substantial and the costs, in terms of reduced flexibility, may be slight. This view should be tempered, however, by two important caveats. First, our findings show that \"present\"-bias, as evidenced by static preference reversals, is far from ubiquitous in this population. Many of the participants in the experiment exhibited, at most, just a modest tendency to be \"present\"-biased. Policy design must take account of this heterogeneity; efforts to help some with their legitimate self-control problems must avoid saddling others with commitments they do not need. Second, and related, our experiment was conducted during the lean season when little income is generated. This makes ours an unlikely context for finding that income fluctuations influence revision. It is possible that income shortfalls may influence revision behavior in other parts of the Malawian agricultural year, such as in the post-harvest months. Our findings should therefore be tested for robustness using similar research designs in other time periods and contexts.",

In contrast, nearly all the coefficients on the indicators for higher target lags are substantially smaller in magnitude and several are below or just at zero. (The exception is the coefficient on the indicator for 11 days, 151 MK. This is probably a chance occurrence, and the coefficient is not statistically different from zero at standard confidence levels.)

As noted above, we adapt to our field environment the methods thatAndreoni and Sprenger (2011) developed for use in the lab. A key advantage of their design is that, with a convex choice set, it permits the relatively rapid collection of information on intertemporal choice in the face of several different rates of return. The method thus allows analysis of the consistency of choice with the law of demand as well as quantitative measures of the degree of dynamic inconsistency. Most recently, experimental studies of time preference have been taken into the field, often in developing countries. Prominent examples include Harrison et al. (2005), Ashraf et al. (2006),andTanaka et al. (2009). Two such field experiments are closely related to ours and thus merit special consideration. The first,Ashraf et al. (2006), asked a sample of 1,777 in the Philippines hypothetical time preference questions on a survey. Later, a subset of this sample was offered a commitment saving product. Women who exhibited present-biased preference reversals on the survey questions were, as predicted by theory, more likely to take up the commitment saving product. Our paper differs from this prior study, most importantly, by studying directly the link between incentivized intertemporal allocation decisions and revision of prior choices. We measure the extent of preference reversals, as well as the basic consistency of choice with rational economic models, and thus provide a quantitative assessment of the mechanisms behind time inconsistency and the demand for commitment. The second closely related paper,Harrison et al. (2005), elicited time preferences from 253 participants in Denmark. Of this sample, 97were later revisited and, importantly, asked to perform the same time preference experiment again. Our experiment is distinguished fromHarrison et al. (2005) by, among other things, making a participant's original choice clear and salient. In our view, both studies ask important and interesting questions. However, our goal is not to evaluate the stability of time preference, but rather to measure revisions of intertemporal plans and to shed light on the determinants of such revisions.",
