        "text": "The question as to whether population growth contributes to poverty is longstanding in population and development studies. Yet one cannot find in the huge literature on that topic the most obvious calculations needed to measure the direct contribution of demographic change to the extent of poverty in the developing world. Poverty is routinely measured as the headcount index, given by the proportion of the population living in households with consumption or income below the poverty line. The headcount index falls when a poor person dies but it rises when a non-poor person dies (ceteris paribus). Similarly, the poverty rate rises when a child is borne into a poor family, while it falls when a child is born into a non-poor family. Furthermore, recent research (reviewed later) points to significant socioeconomic differentials in mortality and fertility; in particular, both birth rates and death rates tend to be higher for the poor.",

The paper measures the contribution of socioeconomic differentials in demographics against an explicit counterfactual, namely the situation when births and deaths are random, i.e., independent of poverty status. The simplest approach to measuring that counterfactual is to net out the differential demographic changes over a given time period and then recalculate the poverty measure at the end point. Comparing this counterfactual poverty measure to the actual value",

        "text": "That is the approach taken here. As we will see, even this conceptually straightforward approach faces some severe data limitations, which generate considerable uncertainty about the poverty impacts of demographic change. And even without these data problems, one would rightly question the assumptions underlying this approach. Most importantly, it does not allow for possible indirect effects on living standards of the high rates of mortality and fertility found among the world's poor. A higher fertility rate for the poor may also entail lower future real wages for unskilled labor and hence higher poverty independently of the direct demographic effect; indeed, there is evidence for precisely this effect for India (van de Walle, 1985; Datt and Ravallion, 1998 , both using state-level panel data). Or higher death rates for the poor may undermine future productivity of the survivors; for example, it has been argued that the orphans resulting from the sharp rise in adult deaths due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic have had lower schooling than they would have had otherwise. 1 An alternative empirical approach is to regress rates of economic growth and/or poverty reduction at country level on rates of population growth and/or their demographic covariates, with controls for other factors affecting growth. Following this approach, Kelley and Schmidt (2001) and Williamson (2001) present evidence of adverse effects of high population growth rates on rates of economic growth; Williamson argues that the key demographic variable is the growth rate of the dependent population. By this view, changes in the age composition of the population affect aggregate savings and (hence) growth. Eastwood and Lipton (1999, 2001 ) use instead changes over time in poverty measures as their dependent variable, for a cross-section of countries, and find evidence of adverse effects of higher fertility on measures of poverty; they find that these effects are transmitted thought both growth and distribution. However, while 1 See Ainsworth and Filmer (2002) who also warn against such generalizations, given the diversity in apparent impacts across countries. aggregate time series or cross-sectional regressions have the potential to reveal the more subtle indirect effects of demographic change, this approach brings its own problems. The implementation inevitably raises concerns about the possible endogeneity of demographic variables and what control variables to use. Schultz (2004) raises a number of concerns about the robustness of the existing cross-country evidence on the demographic determinants of aggregate savings. The robustness of the recent findings from cross-country growth regressions that a higher population growth rate lowers the rate of GDP growth can also be questioned in the light of the results of Sala-I-Martin et al. (2004). 2 As this paper will show, the contribution of demographic changes to aggregate poverty measures is non-parametrically identified. The calculations presented in this paper quantify the first-order poverty impacts of selective mortality and fertility without a regression model. The calculations suggest that the annual impacts of the demographic differentials on poverty account for a sizeable share of the trend rate of \"$1 a day\" poverty reduction in the developing world. At the same time, the results point to the need for better data on socio-economic differentials in mortality and fertility, and for further research on the social and economic processes linking demographic changes to the evolution of poverty measures.",

Health and nutrition indicators have been measured for different strata of households defined in terms of a proxy indicator of \"wealth\" constructed by principal components analysis from the DHS (following a methodology introduced byFilmer and Pritchett, 1999).6  Again the indicators do not include the crude death rate since this cannot be measured reliably with the sample sizes of a typical DHS. The differences in death rates for children indicate that on average the poorest quintile in developing countries (in terms of the proxy wealth indicator) has an infant mortality rate that is 17% higher than average (implying DRD=1.2), though this rises to 35% (DDR=1.4) if one focuses on low and middle income countries only.It is not clear how well the DHS \"wealth index\" reflects actual wealth or the most widely used indicator of living standards, namely aggregate expenditure on consumption (including imputed values for consumption in kind). So it is of interest to also see what can be learnt from surveys for which more familiar consumption or income measures are available. Using nine such surveys for developing countries,Wagstaff (2000) provides estimates of the infant and under-5 mortality rates grouped into quintiles according to household income or expenditure per person. Using the poorest quintile, the implied values of DRD are in the range 1.1 to 1.8. 7",
