We focus on tariff preferences granted by the United States (US) to Latin American countries, for at least two reasons. 1 First, the US is the only country where foreign lobbying expenditures are publicly available. Second, the extent of tariff preferences granted to Latin America by the US is on paper quite important (Andean Act, CBI, CBTPA, GSP, Nafta, Puerto Rico-CBI, and more recently Chile-United States). In practice, it also accounts for a large share of Latin American exports to the United States: around 50 percent. 2 An important and growing empirical literature has been exploring the importance of lobbying in determining trade policy in different countries.",

In a related paper Jobst (2002) focuses on the impact that foreign lobbying by Latin American countries had on their export growth to the United States. He observes a strong positive correlation between foreign lobbying and export growth. One channel through which this can be achieved are tariff preferences granted by the US to Latin American countries.

Indeed, in the case of tariff preferences granted by the US, contribution functions are unlikely to be continuous as the US government either grants full tariff preference (zero tariff) or no preferences at all under most of its preferential schemes. 6 This paper addresses two main questions: Can lobbying by Latin America's exporters in the US explain the observed pattern of tariff preferences?",

Foreign lobbying activities have to be reported following the legislation known as the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) from 1938. 7 The US Department of Justice organizes annually a report on foreign lobbying activities which is sent from the US Attorney General to the US Congress. The FARA annual reports contain the name and address of foreign agents, the name of the principals, the purpose of the agency and the amount of money in return for the agent's activities. 8 First we separated the foreign lobbying expenditure data related to trade on agricultural and industrial goods from those involving trade in services and other types of foreign lobbying 9 . Then, each lobbying expenditure related to trade on goods was mapped into 3-digit ISIC industries. This mapping process was repeated for each entry found on the FARA report for 33 countries in Latin America. We used the FARA reports for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Finally, we calculated the average lobbying expenditure over this four year period by 3-digit ISIC industry and by country. Some of the trade related contributions could not be mapped into particular sectors when they were undertaken by government agencies or private chambers of commerce that encompass several industries. Most of the paper excludes these contributions, except for the section on robustness tests, where these contributions are included in the econometric analysis.",

The point estimate for a is around 2.08 and therefore r = 48 percent. Table 2 provides the same estimates as in Table 1 but the sample excludes Mexico. The reason is that Mexico is a member of Nafta and may therefore be subject to a very different regime than the other Latin American countries that our country and product dummies may not capture. Moreover, Mexico accounts for more than 50 percent of total preferential exports of Latin America to the US. 22 Results are very similar to the ones reported in Table   1 . If we go by our preferred estimates in the last two columns of Table 1 , it seems that returns of foreign lobbying are lower for the non-Mexico Latin American countries. Indeed, returns to foreign lobbying contributions are estimated around 32 percent instead of 48 percent when we include Mexico. 23 This is consistent with anecdotal evidence that the foreign lobbying process has a learning component. Foreign lobbying becomes more effective as they acquire more experience and get accustomed to the ways of doing business in the US political arena (see for example von Bertrab, 1996) .",

Because half of the lobbying expenditures we identified as being trade-related were undertaken by government agencies or other generic business associations, it seems important to check the results when these are included. 24 The problem is how to distribute these lobbying expenditures across sectors in the exporting country. Two methods were followed. First, we used the lobbying country exports to the world as weights to distribute across sectors. As an alternative and to avoid any simultaneity issue we use exports to the rest of the world (i.e., excluding the United States). In order to avoid introducing too much \"artificial\" variation across sectors, we reduce the industry disag-gregation to the 2-digit level of the ISIC (potentially 16 exporting sectors per country). Finally to avoid attributing lobbying expenditure by government agencies and generic business associations that were undertaken for other reasons than tariff preferences to any of the sectors, we arbitrarily decide that if the final lobbying expenditure of any particular sector was more than 2 times the tariff revenue collected on those exports, then the observation was dropped. 25 The first two columns in Table 3 Table 3 are consistent with the ones reported so far. The estimates of a that use government agencies lobbying expenditures are smaller than those reported in Table 1 and the returns to foreign lobbying are somehow higher: between 62 and 97 percent depending on the method used to distribute government agencies lobbying expenditures across 2-digit ISIC sectors. Note that one may have a preference for the results reported in columns (5) and (6) , which use Latin American exports to the rest of the world, which are likely to be less endogenous than exports to the world (which includes exports to the US). In such a case the returns to foreign lobbying are higher (although not statistically so) than those reported in columns (5) and (6) Finally, note that lobbying only explains a very small part of the tariff preference variation. Without the inclusion of country and product dummies, the pseudo-R 2 are well below 1 percent. Many other determinants of tariff preferences are captured by the product and country dummies, as well as the error term. Nevertheless, the returns to foreign lobbying seem to be relatively high.

To make the process easier we follow Krishna et al.

The average per year of all the entries reached 102 million dollars. From the six categories identified above only the ones with numbers (4) and (6) are clearly related to trade on goods. Then, we decided to eliminate contributions from categories (1), (2), (3) and also those purely from political purposes located in category (5) .Contributions from categories (4) and (6) were mapped into 3-digit ISIC codes using the name of the contribution's principal and the purpose of the agency. The table below gives some interesting features about the composition of the data set. It is interesting to note that from 619 entries in the FARA reports only 109 were related to lobbying from specific industries in the manufacturing or agriculture sectors. Besides, only 15 percent of total contributions from Latin American countries were done directly by private agents like those contained in categories (4) and (6) . Category (4) accounted for 25 percent of the entries and categories (6) for the remaining 75 percent.",

The data source is the excellent customs data set provided by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC). 10 It provides information on the value of imports and duties paid under different import regimes from each country at the tariff line level (Harmonized System (HS) 8-digit). This allows us to calculate actual tariff preferences (i.e., those ac-tually granted at customs and not 'on paper'). The advantage is that actual preferences capture the effects of non-trade barriers (agriculture and textile & clothing quotas, rules or origin, etc...) on the value of the preference granted \"on paper\". To calculate the tariff preferences at the 3-digit level of the ISIC classification we proceeded as follows. We obtained data on duties and import values for each product exported by Latin American countries at the 8-digit level of the HS classification for the period 1997-2000. The average across this four year period was calculated by country and by HS 8-digit line. For the products exported by Latin American countries, we also collected data on duties and import values from the world, but that entered the US under the MFN regime. The actual tariff collected on each of these 8-digit tariff line products was then calculated for US imports from Latin America, but also from the world under the MFN regime by simply dividing duties collected by the value of imports. This provided us with two tariffs: the (potentially) preferential tariff on each Latin American country, denoted t F , and the MFN tariff, denoted t, at the 8-digit HS level.",

        "text": "Analytical setup Consider an economy in which consumers maximize a quasi-linear utility function U = c 0 + m k=1 u(c k ). Good zero is the numeraire. Given this functional form, there is no income or substitution effect on demand. The supply side is a specific-factor model where primary inputs into production are sector-specific capital and mobile labor. Production of good zero uses labor only under CRS, which fixes the wage rate. Thus, there is no general-equilibrium effect on the supply side either. Owners of sector-specific capital have an incentive to get politically organized and lobby for trade policies so as to raise capital's return. Resident owners of specific capital have mass zero in the population and consequently do not consider their consumption bundle or share of tariff revenue when lobbying the home government.The political game is as follows. Politically organized owners of specific capital, whether nationals or foreigners, lobby the domestic government for trade policies that are advantageous to them. For domestic import-competing producers, this means asking for tariffs on imports, whereas for foreign producers exporting into the domestic market, it means asking for tariff preferences. In order to simplify the setup, we will assume that ROW imports (imports from non-preferred countries) are sufficiently large to absorb the increase in preferential imports that would result from full preferences. This \"large market\" assumption ensures that there is no political rivalry between domestic and preferential-partner lobbies who in effect try to influence two distinct and independent policy instruments (the MFN tariff and the rate of preference respectively).Lobbies move first, domestic ones by offering contributions conditioned on the MFN tariff in their sector of activity, and foreign ones by simultaneously offering contributions conditioned on the rate of tariff preference. Let the number of trade partners be denoted by n. Then the government picks an m\u00d7(n + 1) matrix of MFN tariffs and preference rates. Given the absence of general-equilibrium effects and the \"large market\" assumption, the game is a collection of independent principal-agent problems. The form of these principal-agent relationships differs, however, because the government's action is a continuous variable in the case of MFN tariffs and a binary one in the case of preferences. In the logic of common-agency models a la Bernheim-Whinston (1986b), domestic lobbies face the government with truthful contribution schedules, i.e. functions of the MFN tariff whose derivative is equal to the derivative of their own profit function. Foreign lobbies, by contrast, face the government with pairs of transfers corresponding to the two possible values of the preference rate (zero and full). Alternatively, one may think of the game between the government and foreign lobbies as a standard auction in which the latter buy indivisible preferences. This game is considerably simpler than a menu auction a la Bernheim-Whinston (1986a). Sticking to the principalagent interpretation, each foreign lobby offers the smallest transfer inducing the government to grant preferences, which means, in the absence of hidden action, that the lobby keeps the entire protection rent. The government ignores the simultaneous game between other (foreign and domestic) lobbies by virtue of the model's independence properties. Let i = 1, ..., n denote trading partners (i.e. countries) and let k = 1, ..., m denote tariff lines (i.e., products). Let t k be the home country's MFN tariff on good",

This paper explores the importance of lobbying in the US by Latin American exporters in explaining the extent of tariff preferences granted by country and product. Empirical results suggest that lobbying by Latin American exporters is indeed a significant determinant of tariff preferences, although not a very important one. Other country and product characteristics seem to explain a much larger share of the variation in tariff preferences granted by the US government to Latin American exporters. However, it pays Latin American exporters to lobby for tariff preferences in the US. Returns to foreign lobbying are estimated to be around 50 percent. Last, but not least, we provide a methodology to estimate the weight given to social welfare in the US government objective function (relative to lobbying contributions) in the case of a non-differentiable contribution function. Indeed, in the case of tariff preferences in the US, the foreign contribution function is likely to be non-continuous as preferences are generally either fully granted or not granted at all in the United States. Relaxing the continuous contribution function assumption provided us with an estimate of the weight granted to social welfare (a) around 2, partly solving the empirical puzzle of the empirical literature, where estimates for the US are above 100.",

Although Mexico belongs to the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), seven Latin American countries received higher preferences than Mexico. One reason for the unexpected lower US trade preference to Mexico vis-a-vis other countries not members of NAFTA is that rules of origin in that trade bloc are very stiff, obligating many Mexican exports within NAFTA to use the US's MFN regime as shown by Estevadeordal et al. (2002). At the bottom of the country list, there is Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Bermudas, Saint Lucia and Dominican Republic; all these countries enjoyed almost zero preferences on their exports to the United States. Note that tariff preferences granted by the United States at the tariff line level are usually full preferences, i.e., \u03b8 = 1. In our data set \u03b8 is a continuous variable for several reasons. First, the data is aggregated at the 3-digit ISIC level. Second, some of the preferential agreements have phase-out periods for preferential tariff elimination. Finally, even if full preferences are granted on paper, some exports may still enter under the MFN regime, because they do not satisfy rules of origin.",
