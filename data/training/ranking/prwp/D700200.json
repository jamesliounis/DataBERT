As Cornia (1987) discusses, households faced with sharply reduced employment and incom3 prospects in the formal (or modern) sectors -manufacturing, services, mining, and government -tend to seek employment and income opportunities in the informal economy. The first to shift are those who have lost jobs in the formal sector. Next, employed formal sector workers, especially government employees, resort to moonlighting activities, most of which are informal. As household incomes decline, married women and children who previously did not work in the market are drawn into informal market activities, and soon new entrants to the labor force begin to find jobs in the informal rather than the formal sector. 3 The rapid growth of the informal sector has led international aid agencies and governments to explore policies to improve the profitability of such businesses. This surge of interest, however, is not based on much empirical evidence about the underlying determinants of the performance of the firms.",

Litan and others (1987) report that the official national accounts estimate of the informal sector's contribution to GDP it, 3'84 resulted in an understatement of total GDP of 23 percent. Perhaps even more striking is the estimate that 439,000 Lima residents depend on the underground commercial economy, and almost three fourths (314, 000) of these individuals depend on street sales. According to de Soto, these activities generated about $25 million a month in gross sales in 1985 and an average ret per capita profit of $58 a month, about 40 percent more than the legal minimum wage. The 314,000 street merchants include 91,455 street vendors, are 42 percent of the Lima work force involved in commerce.",

Table 5 shows the nonlinearity analysis arising from the last diagnostic iteration. All the parameters of the model fell within acceptable limits for nonlinearity. Those parameters for which the curvature measures were greatest were associated with the spline variables for capital and expenses. These results confirm our finding that it was inappropriate to specify constant coefficients for the aggregate expenses and capital variables. They also suggest that the spline approach leads to a model with a sufficiently accurate linear approximation around the nonlinear least squares optimum. The nonlinearity analysis increased our confidence in the quality of the estimated model and in the validity of applying traditional statistical tests to the model. This in turn suggests that the multiplicative error term for total revenues given by exp[v 1 I in equation 7is lognormally distribt'ted.",

Thus the process of retailing is the same among firms, but the endowment effect makes them different. Put another way, firms with less capital, expenses, or labor usually have higher returns at the margin but typically lower revenues. As seen in Table 3 or Table 9 , a high proportion of female firms, but a much smaller proportion of male and mixed firms, have low amounts of capital, expenses, and labor. In our sample about a fourth of the businesses had little or no capital and a third carried no inventories -most of these were female firms.

The kernel function is typically taken from the set of many times differentiable multivariate density'functions. One popular kernel function is the multivariate normal or Gaussian density. Note, however, that the choice of a Gaussian kernel in no way restricts the estimated density. Indeed, it would appear that density estimates are much less sensitive to the kernel function than they are to the window width, h. The choice of the window width determines, in part, the degree of smoothing of the densicy estimate. Recent work by Racine (1989) has examined the optimal window width, h, in the sense of integrated mean square error. The results for the Peru Living Standards Survey data make use of this optimal window width and a Gaussian kernel.",

For example, labor, capital and expenses (materials) have positive marginal products everywhere. But only 7 of 17 parameters are estimated with precision as opposed to 13 of 17 in the urban data. The model explains 59 percent of the variation in the dependent variable. This compares well with the corresponding 61 percent for the urban model.We computed values for the marginal revenue products of labor, capital, and expenses for every observation in the sample of 288 rural businesses. Table   B3 gives the means, standard deviations, and decile values for the distributions of these derivatives in the sample. These values can be compared with corresponding results for the urban model presented in Table 4 . In general, the marginal revenue products for rural firms are lower than those for urban firms;the rural values for labor and expenses are about 80 percent of the urban levels, and the rural values for capital are almost the same as the urban levels. Tne troubling statistical feature of the rural model is that many of the data points may be highly influential. Of the 288 observations, 56 data points (20 percent ",

Introduction ......................................... 1 Introduction Few topics in the literature on development economics have inspired as much interest, controversy, and rhetoric as the informal sector in developing countries. 1 Here the term is intended as a shorthand expression to describe the collection oJf loosely organized (but not necessarily fly-by-night) small-scale competitive family businesses. Such businesses rely little on nonfamily hired labor. Their technologies are labor intensive and they operate largely outside the legal, bureaucratic, and regulatory framework reg.rding such matters as licenses, taxes, and contractual obligations. An important characteristic of the informal sector is that the free play of market forces generally determines returns to productive factors, especially labor. The enterprises are usually concentrated in low-income areas of large metropolitan centers, but it is not uncommon to find rural households, for example in Kenya and Peru, that have joined the informal sector. 2",

Examples of different credit programs include the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the Self-Employed Women's Association in India, the Banco Popular in Costa Rica, the Badan Kredit Kecamatan in Indonesia, the Northeast Union of Assistance to Small Businesses in Brazil, the Institute for the Development of the Informal Sector in Peru, Fondo de Fomento para la Pequena Industria y la Artesania in Ecuador, and the Small Projects Program of the Inter-American Development Bank. 24",
