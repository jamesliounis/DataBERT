In these cases, the quality of pensions services received is so low that any administrative charge appears burdensome.

Consider why bigemployers in the United States have never sought to contract out pension administration with the Social Security Administration to take advantage of its reported low costs. The reason is twofold: first, the true collection costs are as low as their own, because employers can transfer funds to the IRS at the same cost as to their pension fund. Second, many US employers are willing to absorb the administrative costs of the benefit portion of their private pension systems, even though in the case of defined benefit plans they have been several times larger than those reported by the Social Security Administration, because it is unable to provide the security afforded by funded benefits.",

Its attractiveness can be thought of as a high perceived quality, including substantial insulation from political pressures, high ability to reach the rate of return available in the country, high degree of funding and outstanding quality of service. Although we do not attempt to measure these qualities, we ask whether the administrative charges are also higher than in pension systems that seem to offer less quality. If they were not, we would be in the presence of an unusually rare combination. The evidence in this paper suggests that administrative charges in the new Chilean system are in an intermediate range of costs. On the other hand, Chilean costs appear to be higher than in the state-run system in Malaysia, which offers lower quality services but still much better than Zambia.",

One study that attempted to measure employers' costs through a survey was Beveridge's for England'. He found that these costs were around 20% of explicit administrative costs, but his survey was restricted to firms with more than 2,200 employees. It is not surprising that over history, consideration of administrative cost for employers affected the evolution of the public mandatory pension system. In the US, coverage under the social security retirement system was restricted to industrial wage earners until the 1950's because the administration cost of payroll tax collection and related record-keeping in small establishments and among the self-employed was felt to be prohibitive (Parsons, 1992) . For the same reason, firms with less than 30 workers in Bolivia are currently exempted from contributing. These costs may be even more important when assessing the relative advantages of joint collection of taxes and mandatory social security contributions, as compared to separate collection.",

For example, in Chile under its old system, in 1950-80, the delay for obtaining a pension upon compliance with the age requirement was so large than an industry of \"pension advisors\" emerged. They specialized in pushing the paperwork in the pension administration bureaus. In fact, many of these bureaucrats receive very low explicit salaries and are compensated through substantial income from bribes. In turn bribes are paid by the worker who wants a pension. In such a pension system, it may appear as if the pension administration had very low costs, because it employs people full time for very low explicit wages. This ignores that total charges on the pensioner include payments to a pension advisor which in turn pays the bribes.

Smaller countries should exhibit higher charges for this reason alone. b) International differences in the size distribution of firms are large, and they are associated with different cost levels in pensiop administration. For example, in the U.S., 62.1% of the non-farm civilian labor force worked in firms with 100 or more employees in 1988 (EBRI, 1992, page 69) . In Chilean industry, which excludes the service sector, in 1983 only 42.6% (SERCOTEC 1984, Table 1 .1) of the labor force worked in firms of that size. The difference is much larger for poor developing countries. It is a well established empirical fact in the United States that smaller firms must pay higher average administrative. charges per worker, so we expect the same correlation to hold across countries. The importance of costs related to the average size of firm may be inferred from the experience of multiemployer pension plans in the US: total costs increase 15% when the number of member firms. double, keeping constant the number of workers (Parsons, 1992) .",

This is shown by costs studies of the mutual fund management industry in the U.S., which find costassets elasticities between 0.423 and 0.871 (Baumol et al, page 187) More importantly, investment management costs depend of the type of portfolio held. They are very low in Malaysia, where 78% of the funds are held in specially-issued treasury securities and 10% is held in short term notes issued by local banks, several of which are state-owned. Investment management costs have been small in Chile, where investment regulations have limited asset choice. In March 1992 Chilean pension fund managers could choose only among 48 equities, 38 corporate bonds and 37 bank issuers. In the United States, where asset choice is -very wide, investment management costs are large. However even in this case investment management costs are less than a quarter of total costs (see evidence in Table 8 ). The tendency towards indexed funds and other types of passive management should counteract the higher costs due to the tendency towards global investment, suggesting that investment management costs will remain secondary.",

In the Chilean -case, these have been much higher than expected, as shown in the next table, suggesting that the quality of service was very high. However, these high returns were due mostly to high returns generally in Chile. It is more meaningful to measure the quality of investment services by the difference between actual returns and potential returns at the same level of risk. In the Chilean case this difference has been remarkably small, as shown in econometric work by Walker (1991) . In other words, Chilean workers were able to sbare in booming bond and stock markets in Chile during the 1980's.

This means receiving contributions every month, crediting it to the correct individual account, pursuing mismatches and putting pressure on the employer if the contributions are not paid at the appropriate time. b) Insurance and Guarantees. For active workers, insurance refers to invalidity and survivorship. This service is packaged with the rest, so the administrative costs associated to invalidity cannot be separated. c) Individual Accounts. Credits and debits have-to be allocated to individual accounts. .his includes a personal financial statement sent every four months to each contributor, and once a year to affiliates that have not contributed for 12 months. The statement indicates the amounts received from the employer, the return obtained, the commissions charged and the new outstanding balance. d) Personal Information. AFP staff answers customer questions regarding accumulation rules, alternative ways of obtaining a pension, and rules governing insurance coverage. This service is important in Chile because of three reasons: (i) several important decisions are left to individual choice, so individuals tend to inquire frequently; (ii) the Chilean pension system was reformed in 1981 and learning is still going on; and (iii) the law that governs is under continual improvement. Some informal estimates by AFP industry experts suggests that a large share of branch personnel is devoted to perform this service. e) Fund Management. One measure of this service wold be the difference between the rate of return obtained in the AFPP and the one that could be obtained in the simplest savings account, after correcting for differences in risk, the value of queuing time and other aspects. 4 Chilean AFPs provide three non-pension services, free of additional charge: a) Starting in January 1988. contributors were allowed to open a voluntary savings account in their AFP. The only requirement is to have contributed for one month into the retirement account. This savings account is similar to those offered by mutual funds in other countries. Up to four withdrawals per year are allowed. In March-1992 there were 453,608 voluntary savings accounts in the AFP system, which is 10.7% of the mandatory accounts of all registered persons. During that month there were 278,584 deposits and 60,862 withdrawals, and the average balance at the end of the month was 572.8 dollars. b) Starting in January 1991, two subsets of contributors were required to open another account with their AFPs to comply with new labor legislation. One group is comprised of workers who agree with their employers on severance payments payable upon termination regardless of motive, if the agreed amount is larger than 7 months worth of wages. After the seventh .year of employment, the employer must put aside one more salary per year for severance payment purposes. This amount has to be deposited by the employer in a special severance account in an AFP. The AFP can pay it to the worker as a lump sum only after the worker shows he has been terminated.",

To obtain a full pension (between 50% and 65% of the average wage during the 36 months prior to the disability notice), at least 24 contributions out of the last 40 months prior to the notice of invalidity are required.

It is instructive to ask why large employers in the United States have never sought to contract out pension administration with the Social Security Administration, to take advantage of its low costs. This is a relevant question, considering that federal pensions are adjusted by the CPI, so they offer better protection than private annuities in case of inflation. This could mean that an employer pays the SSA a single premium for each employee that retires, the SSA spends the funds immediately paying benefits to others, and the SSA guarantees the-payment of the associated benefits out of future taxes, subject to future Congressional changes to the amount of the benefits. This description suggests one possible answer: many US employers prefer to absorb the charges associated to the purchase of annuities in order to have them funded and protected by contract law.",

On the other hand, as private annuities are indexed to the CPI in the Chilean case, the difference in quality is even more obvious.

This would be quite similar to the phased withdrawal used in Chile plus longevity insurance.

This information is so valuable that AFPs prefer to incur higher collection costs rather than sharing information. This seems to be specially true for the largest AFPs, who already enjoy to some degree the advantages of joint collection, so the savings for them are smaller.
