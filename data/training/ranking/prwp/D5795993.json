  "abstract": "A large literature examines the link between shocks to households and the educational attainment of children.We use new data to estimate the impact of shocks to teachers on student learning in Mathematics and English. Using absenteeism in the 30 days preceding the survey as a measure of these shocks we find large impacts: A 5-percent increase in the teacher's absence rate reduces learning by 4 to 8 percent of average gains over the year. This reduction in learning achievement likely reflects both the direct effect of increased absenteeism and the indirect effects of less lesson preparation and lower teaching quality when in class. We document that health problems-primarily teachers' own illness and the illnesses of their family members-account for more than 60 percent of teacher absences; not surprising in a country struggling with an HIV/AIDS epidemic. The relationship between shocks to teachers and student learning suggests that households are unable to substitute adequately for teaching inputs. Excess teaching capacity that allows for the greater use of substitute teachers could lead to larger gains in student learning.",

        "text": "The relationship between schooling inputs and educational outcomes continues to receive wide attention in discussions about how to improve educational outcomes. Educational investment, particularly in poor countries, depends a good deal on publicly provided resources to schools. However, it is also influenced by inputs at the household level. For some resources, such as textbooks and other educational materials, parents are able to substitute at home what is not provided in the school. For other resources, such substitution may be harder.",

It is possible that parents do not have the time or skills to teach their children at home. Further, the agency costs of hiring teachers in a market may be high and such costs may be accentuated due to low overall levels of learning in low-income countries. Perhaps not surprisingly then, the literature consistently finds that teachers contribute significantly to levels and growth in learning achievement; however, considerable debate continues about the specific attributes of teachers that matter.",

The study focuses on Zambia, where the impact of AIDS and other illnesses seem to be the reason for much of the observed absenteeism of teachers. 1 The paper isolates the effect of the shocks that teachers face during an academic year-primarily their own illness and the illnesses of family members-on student learning. These shocks, as measured by episodes of teacher absence, led to large losses in learning achievement. A shock associated with a 5 percent increase in teacher absence reduced learning achievement by 4 to 8 percent of average gains in English and Mathematics during the academic year studied. The size of the estimated impact is substantial and, in addition to the losses due to time away from class, probably reflects lower teaching quality when in class and less lesson preparation when at home.",

        "text": "The impact is robust to controls for student absenteeism. The estimated impact of student absenteeism is of the same magnitude as the effect of shocks to teachers. Since every teacher teaches many students, this raises the possibility that excess teaching capacity, which allows for the greater use of substitute teachers, could significantly increase learning achievement. The protective effect of such insurance could have larger impacts on learning achievement than insuring and supporting students and their families. Moreover, in countries with a high HIV/AIDS burden, substantial welfare gains could accrue through a reduction in the frequency or impact of shocks associated with absenteeism. For example, Bell, Devarajan and Gersbach (2003) posit huge declines in human capital due to the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on affected economies. The results presented in this paper provide strong micro-foundations for this assumption and challenge conclusions that find a small (or no) impact of the HIV epidemic on the education sector (Bennell 2005 ).",

As households try to optimize over future time periods, they face uncertainty related to two school-based inputs: uncertainty in the quality of the teacher (non-time varying) and timing and severity of shocks to the teacher (time-varying).",

This panel of test scores allows us to deal with omitted variable bias associated with student tracking, but does not account for unobserved changes in teacher characteristics. To do so, we exploit a tradition in which some teachers stay with the same student cohort throughout primary school. By restricting attention to the sample of pupils with the same teacher in both years, and this is the basis of our identification strategy, we address concerns that arise from unobserved child and teacher heterogeneity.",

It is also robust to a number of identification problems common to estimating the impact of school inputs on learning, which we discuss below. However, the results obtained on the sample of students who remained with the same teacher do not extend to those who switched teachers during the two years of the study. We suggest two reasons for this finding. The first is selective matching of students and teachers, and the second is higher precautionary educational spending among households whose children switched teachers. Although we are able to show that the differential impact among the movers and non-movers did not arise from differences in the sample of students, we are unable to distinguish between these two suggested channels.",

        "text": "Interest in teacher attributes on student learning has recently emerged in the educational production function literature. Papers using analysis of variance techniques have shown that the variation in test scores explained by teachers is substantial. Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin (1998), using data from Tennessee schools, find evidence of significant teacher effects. Park and Hannum (2002) , using student-teacher matched data from China, find that variation due to teacher effects explains about 25 percent of variation in test scores. More traditional regression-based studies also validate this finding. Rockoff (2004) using a 12-year panel of teacher-student data from two school districts in New Jersey finds significant teacher fixed effects. A one standard deviation change in the teacher fixed effect (unobserved quality) is associated with gains in Mathematics and reading of 0.26 and 0.16 standard deviations respectively. Less is known about the specific attributes of teachers that affect student learning. Limited evidence on teacher experience and training is provided by Rockoff (2004) and Angrist and Lavy (2001) , who find that both experience and training have a positive impact on learning achievement.",

This policy reduced the number of sick days taken by 30 percent and increased the share of teachers with perfect attendance from 8 percent to 34 percent. 2 Data was not available to evaluate the impact of this policy on student performance. Ehrenberg and others (1991) study the effect of teacher absenteeism on school level pass-rates using variation in school district leave policies as an instrument for absenteeism.

Negative shocks that result in higher absenteeism may also lead to less supplementary inputs by the teacher. A teacher who is sick is likely to be absent more often and also likely to spend less time on lesson preparation. Our estimates thus capture the joint effect of absence from the classroom and lower inputs due to the shock. The policy implications (discussed below) vary accordingly.",

It is likely that the nature and severity of shocks that teachers experience varies dramatically across the United States and low-income countries. In a country like Zambia, with very high HIV prevalence, shocks due to illnesses and funerals can lead to long absences and substantial declines in teaching performance. The difference in absenteeism is striking. Absence rates in U.S.-based studies of 5 percent (or in Jacobson's case an average of 7 days per year) are low compared to those in low-income countriesan ongoing study finds averages of 20 percent and above in Sub-Saharan Africa, 25 percent in India and 11 percent and above in Latin America (Chaudhury and Hammer 2005; Chaudhury and others 2004; World Bank 2003; Glewwe and others 2001). 3 In Zambia, the percentage of teachers absent from school at the time of a surprise visit was closer to 18 percent and average days of absence fall just under 21 days during the year. 4 In addition, in the U.S. the policy of providing substitute teachers minimizes disruption. Although evidence on teacher absenteeism in low income countries is sparse, the use of substitute teachers is low. Thus, both the extent of shocks and the ability of schools to cope is accentuated in our data.",

The price of educational inputs is the numeraire, the price of other consumption goods is P t , and r is the interest rate. The production function constraint (3) dictates how inputs are converted to educational outcomes and the boundary condition (4) requires that at t = T the household must have zero assets so that all loans are paid back and there is no bequest motive. 5 We assume that teacher inputs consist of two parts, and both are outside the control of the household-inputs conditional on quality m q t and shocks to these inputs \u00b5 t . The shocks are zero in expectation (E(\u00b5 t ) = 0) so that m t = m q t + \u00b5 t . Teacher inputs conditional on quality m q t are assumed to be unknown, but at the time the household makes its decision it knows the underlying distribution of quality and the stochastic process related to \u00b5 t (but not the actual level). The two sources of uncertainty in this model are uncertainty about the quality of teachers and uncertainty about shocks to teacher inputs.",

Finally, the concavity of the production function will limit the willingness of households to boost education \"too rapidly\" since the cost is increasing in household inputs.

In particular, given P t , if increasing risk increases the right-hand side of equation (7) , households will spend less on other goods X t and more on teaching inputs z t than before. Two implications emerge. First, the expected path of educational outcomes would be higher-although this will not necessarily have an impact on the changes in outcomes between two periods. Secondly, the ex post impact of shocks to teacher inputs in a particular period may be different depending on the extent of risk faced by households ex ante. 6 Appendix 2 develops the circumstances under which an increase in the ex-ante risk faced by households leads to a decrease in the impact of ex post shocks due to a commensurate increase in ex ante household investment. For the environment studied in this paper, this implies that the sample of students who switched teachers (and thus faced greater uncertainty regarding teacher quality) would be less susceptible to shocks in teacher inputs, for instance through the teacher's or her family's ill health. Note that this difference in the estimated impact of the shock arises even if movers are randomly assigned to teachers. Thus, to the extent the households increase their ex ante educational investment due to precautionary motives, we expect to find a larger coefficient of teacher-level shocks on student learning for children who stayed with the same teacher compared to children who switched. 7 8 ",

The educational environment is discussed in some detail in Das and others (2004a) and Das and others (2004b) . For our purposes, an important factor is the overall decline in GDP per capita in the country from the mid-1970s due to a decline in worldwide copper prices, the country's main export (per-capita income declined almost 5 percent annually between 1974 and 1990). The decline in per capita income has had an impact on educational attainment. For instance, net primary school enrolment currently at 72 percent is historically low, following a moderate decline over the previous decade. Although the government responded to deterioration in the education profile with an investment program at the primary and \"basic\" level in 2000, a continuing problem has been the inability of the government to hire and retain teachers in schools.",

Not surprisingly, teacher attrition has received a lot of attention, both in the popular press and in institutional reports (our data and that from the census of schools in 2002 corroborates the high rates of attrition (Das and others 2004b)).

        "text": "Our source of variation for shocks to teacher inputs is variation in teacher absenteeism, where absence is defined as a teacher being away from school during regular school hours. 12 Unfortunately, schools in Zambia (and in most other low-income countries) do not maintain records of teacher's time away from school. To the extent that such records are available, they tend to under-estimate absence by 5-10 percent (Chaudhury and others 2004). Our information on absences is instead based on three different measures that we collected as part of the school survey; spot absence, selfreported absence during the last 30 days and the head-teacher's report of teacher absence during the last 30 days. The most satisfactory measure is the head teacher's report, whereby head teachers provided independent reports of teacher absence over the last 30 days for the entire matched teacher sample. As an indicator for teacher shocks, this is a noisy measure and as usual, measurement error implies that our estimates are likely to be biased towards zero. 13 Table 1 summarizes the school, teacher and student samples. The schools are evenly divided among rural and urban locations, with an average of 23 teachers teaching 912 pupils in every school. There are more female teachers, the majority have teaching certificates and about half have been teaching for five years or more. Absenteeism is a big problem. Head-teachers reported that 304 out of 725 teachers were absent at least once during the last month. Two-thirds of the students live with both parents (7 percent of the children had lost both parents, and another 14 percent had lost one parent), and parental education is relatively high-a majority of the mothers reported studying to levels \"more than primary schooling\" and among fathers, this proportion increases to 72 percent. Despite the high levels of parental and teacher education, learning gains over the academic year were low. On average, children answered only 3.2 questions more in Mathematics from a starting point of 17.2 correct answers (from 45 questions) and 2.4 more in English starting from 11.1 correct answers (from 33 questions). In terms of the standardized score, children gained 0.42 standard deviations in Mathematics and 0.40 in English. 14 Table 2 summarizes our data on head-teacher reports of absenteeism. Teacher illness accounted for 35 percent of all absence episodes, and illnesses in the family and funerals for another 27 percent, suggesting that health-related issues are a major source of shocks to teacher inputs. The head-teacher reported a median absence duration of two days for teacher and family illness and three days for funerals. Table 3 disaggregates the teacher and student characteristics by \"more\" and \"less\" absent teachers, restricting attention to the sample of non-movers (table 1 in appendix 3 provides a similar table for the full sample). While there are some differences in teacher characteristics, these differences are not significant at the usual confidence levels. In terms of student characteristics, there are no differences between the students with less and more absent teachers (an exception is the proportion of students that live within 15 minutes of their schools). Note in particular, that there is no statistically significant difference in the number of days the student was absent (1.42 versus 1.47) across less and more absent teachers. Finally, the characteristics of the sample change somewhat as we progressively exclude those teachers and students on whom we have no information-those excluded tend on average to be male teachers and teachers in rural areas. Table 4 shows differences between non-movers and movers: Schools with non-movers are larger and are more urban. These differences are significant at the usual levels. Teachers who teach nonmovers are more urban (significant), female (significant), more experienced (significant) and have more training (significant). Similarly, there a significant differences in the student characteristics.",

According to the head-teachers reports, the rate of absenteeism for those absent on the day of the survey is almost twice as high compared to those who were present (3.1 vs 1.6 ). The reduced sample excludes the more absent teachers. If the impact of teacher shocks on student learning is linear in the extent of the shock, excluding these teachers from the sample should not affect our estimates. On the other hand, if the marginal impact of the shock decreases with the extent of the shock, a prediction that follows directly from a production function that is concave in teaching inputs, excluding those with severe shocks will lead to an increase in the size of the estimated impact (we estimate the sharp drop-off at low levels of teacher shocks, but not the levelling off later on). It is plausible that these non-linearities drive the differences in estimated impacts across our samples. For both Mathematics and English, we find a sharp drop-off in learning as absenteeism rates increase from 0 to 10 percent, but the comparison between those with 10 percent and those with greater than 10 percent absenteeism rates is less clear-cut. 16 Unfortunately, the small size of our sample does not permit us to investigate these non-linearities further.",

Under this scenario, the coefficient on teacher shocks picks up the additional impact of the shocks on the students, biasing our estimate away from zero.

Table 3 showed that there was no difference in student absenteeism between teachers who were less and more absent (1.42 versus 1.47 days). Continuing in the same vein, table 6 computes a two-way contingency table, where the columns are teachers who were more or less absent and the rows are students who were more or less absent.

While the impact of student absenteeism is large and significant in the case of English and less so for Mathematics, there is no change in the estimated impact of teacher shocks on learning.

However, if in addition, unobserved teacher characteristics have a cumulative effect on student learning, the estimate could pick up this effect as well. Suppose unmotivated teachers are more absent. As long as the lack of motivation affects only the scores in the first year (that is, it is a one-time negative shock), it does not impact on the change in scores between the first and the second year. However, if teacher motivation affects how much students learn in every year, our measure of teacher shocks would pick up both intrinsic motivation as well as time-varying shocks to teaching inputs. Even with such cumulative effects, the estimated coefficient is still identified if households are able to respond to teacher motivation-the impact of lower motivation would be attenuated through greater household participation. We have less to say about how the combination of cumulative teacher effects and household-level constraints may bias our coefficients. To estimate such persistent effects requires data from at least 3 points in time, and this is a hard requirement in low-income countries.

Both in the separate and the nested specifications, head-teachers reports of absence have no impact on learning among children who moved. Moreover, in the nested specification, the coefficient and significance for the non-movers sample is identical to that reported before. We discuss three potential reconciliations for this result. Table 9 explores whether intrinsic differences in the sample account for our results, by excluding children with very different backgrounds from the nested specification. We implement this by the analog of a propensity score matching technique. We first estimate the probability that a student is a mover based on household, teacher and school characteristics and use this regression to predict the probability of moving. We then look only at the area of \"common support\", that is, we only keep in the sample those children whose predicted probabilities are found in both the sample of movers and the sample of children with same-teachers. Again, we find no difference in the estimated coefficients for English and a decline in Mathematics among the non-movers; the estimated coefficients for the movers remains very small and insignificant.",

The identification strategy is based on a restriction of the sample, whereby we focus only on those students who remained with the same teacher in the two concurrent years that they were tested.

To improve educational outcomes, governments should concentrate on providing resources at the school-level that cannot easily be substituted for by households.

However, because schools spend the money received from the government on resources such as textbooks, there is a high degree of substitutability between public and private funding. Increases in the former crowd-out the latter. Contrariwise, this paper argues that households are unable to insure themselves against teacher-level shocks. Moreover, the estimated impact of teacher-level and student-level shocks are of roughly the same magnitude. This confirms findings from other studies that teachers matter and further, raises the possibility that insurance at the school-level may be more beneficial than at the household-level.

In attributing all teacher absence to negative shocks, we have probably been overly generous-it is likely that at least some portion of teacher absence is due to shirking rather than illness. If so, incentive schemes should work. In the United States, Jacobson's work (Jacobson 1989 and Jacobson 1991) shows that payment incentives do lead to declines in absenteeism.

If teachers in Zambia and other Sub-Saharan countries are absent because they shirk and incentive schemes and greater accountability lead both to greater attendance and better performance, then such schemes can lead to better learning outcomes. However, if teachers' utility functions are altruistic so that most absenteeism is \"genuine\", incentive schemes might hurt teacher motivation. This conflict between treating teachers as \"professionals\" who respond to monetary incentives and thinking of them as \"dedicated to students' needs\" remains at the center of a contentious debate in the United States.

With better access to markets for private tuition and home schooling, we expected the impact of teacher shocks to be lower among the sample of children who are non-movers. Intriguingly we found no impact of teacher shocks on student learning among the movers in our sample. We suggested two reasons for this finding. If the sample of children who switched teachers were not randomly assigned, selective matching might bias our estimate. A second interesting possibility was the role of uncertainty in teaching inputs on household investments. The model shows that greater uncertainty in teaching inputs leads to an ex ante response among households through greater precautionary spending. Faced with greater uncertainty in teaching inputs, the movers would have higher precautionary spending and thus be less susceptible to ex post shocks.",

So, responding to increased risk by spending more on the risky activity may go against the basic results discussed inSandmo (1969). However, since the produced commodity also enters the utility function, these results do not hold, and under reasonable conditions, households may choose to invest more in the activity in response to more uncertainty, as a means of guaranteeing a reasonable amount of the produced commodity for consumption. The argument is similar to the analysis of precautionary savings, where the choice is between consuming more today compared to tomorrow, as inDeaton (1992). In the basic model, convexity of marginal utility is then sufficient for increased savings in response to increased uncertainty in income, even though the risk related to future utility has increased, affecting the marginal benefit to savings.8 If the price of boosting cognitive achievement were constant, then convexity of marginal utility is sufficient. If not, then as long as user-costs increase only at a decreasing rate in teacher inputs, households will still spend more on household-level educational inputs when risk increases. In this formulation credit markets are perfect so that there are no bounds on At+1 apart from (4); the perfect credit market assumption is relaxed in our discussion of the empirical results. To see how the theory is affected, seeDas et al. (2004a).",

This would include absence episodes while teachers are in school. Glewwe, Kremer and Moulin.(2001) find that teachers are in school but absent from class 12 percent of the time. We focus only on time away from school.13 Absences and their reasons are broadly similar for different methods used to collect absenteeism data. Appendix 1 provides a discussion of these alternative measures.Despite the measurement error associated with a 30-day recall period as a measure of year-long shocks, there are established precedents in household surveys. Most household survey modules on illness, for instance, restrict themselves to recall periods of 30-days or less. Nevertheless, these measures have been extensively used and validated in the literature on health and economic outcomes.",
