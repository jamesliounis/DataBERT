The location of depots, in combination with transport pricing to farmers, is capable of affecting the productivity of the agricultural sector and of transport investments.

Under the first system, the farmer pays the full cost of transport to the port. Under the other system, transport from the nearest depot to the port is paid by the marketing board. The latter is the widely practiced policy of panterritorial pricing and it implies a (full) subsidy of transport cost. The study assesses the effects of panterritorial pricing empirically, on the data of one country, the Cote d'Ivoire and one of its chief export crops, cotton. Only the elasticity of supply of cotton farmers could not be estimated (panterritorial pricing itself suppresses relevant information since prices are not allowed to vary over space) but had to be assumed, and assumed constant, and subjected to sensitivity analysis.",

Theoretical analysis then shows (consistent with results in other areas of the ecenomics of taxation) that some transport price intervention is optimai if and only it output is taxed. For the special case of a constant elasticity of agricultural supply, the proportional rate of the optimal transport subsidy is equal to the rate of the tax on output (calculated on the export price). There is then an optimal transport subsidy (or an optimal location-specific price for cotton at the depot), that rises in an absolute amount with distance but is less than the 100 percent subsidy implicit in panterritorial pricing.",

First, to raise the same amount of revenue that the country raises by panterritorial pricing of cotton: * as a general proposition, the loss to aggregate producers' surplus from panterritorial rather than optimal pricing increases with the elasticity of supply. But in Cote d'lvoire where cotton is grown in a very compact area, the percentage gain from moving to optimal pricing is small: say, up to 3 percent for the higher elasticities of supply; * but as optimal is substituted for panterritorial pricing, there results a marked redistribution of producer surplus, from farmers in remote zones to those near the port; * and if the given revenue is raised by a pure export tax, so that farmers pay the full cost of transport to port, the effect in terms of aggregate producer surplus is superior to that under panterritorial pricing (though inferior to optimal pricing), while the redistribution of producer surplus from remote to near zones is greater than results from a move to optimal pricing. The movement from panterritorial to optimal pricing reduces producer surplus for the remotest zone by about one-quarter, while a move to full-cost pricing of transport lowers it bv one-third: and * lastly, transport investments that reduce the cost per ton-km yield the largest return (in terms of producer surplus) under panterritorial pricing, lower under optimal pricing, lowest under a pure export tax which leaves farmers with the full cost of transport. The differences according to the pricing system (in the Cote d'Ivoire) are again not very large but rise with the elasticity of supply, and would be larger if cultivation were more dispersed over space than in this country.

The price paid to farmers at the depot will then include the transport subsidy. Under panterritorial pricing, the farmer only bears the cost of transporting his crop from farm to depot; under optimal pricing, he will, in addition, bear some part of the cost of transport from depot to port. When depots are very densely spaced, as in Cote d'Ivoire, there will not be much derouting or \"backhauling\" which occurs when the farmer has the incentive to carry his cotton to a depot that is nearer to him but further away from the port than the next-nearest depot, i.e. when he carries cotton away from the port rather than toward it. Less dense spacing gives scope for such \"backhauling\" which the study shows to be potentially very costly in transport resources and, hence, in producer surplus and state revenue from agricultural taxation. Under optimal pricing, a farmer may \"backhaul\" when the cost of his own transport exceeds the difference between the (lower) price paid at the nearest depot and the (higher) price obtainable at a depot closer to the port. Under panterritorial pricing, his only objective is to save his own transport cost and he will carry to the nearest depot. The location and density of depots is therefore a problem for transport policy. But since depots cost something to build, the optimal pricing solution is constrained by the cost of implementation.",

This minimizes the cost, whether that is reckoned in interest or in crop losses: the optimal procedures minimize (other things being equal) the aggregate waste through deterioration. In the Cote d'Ivoire, however, the delay in collecting the ready crop is negatively correlated with the distance of zones from the port. Failing other good reasons, the cause may be institutional inefficiency and distorted incentives for the transport operators. If good reasons (such as differential timing of rains) do not exist, the procedure is irrational. It may induce \"backhauling\": the nearer farms carrying their crop further inland to depots served earlier than those closer to port. It may also induce over-investment in transport equipment, by the nearer farms, which may thus minimize their loss from being left until last in the timing of evacuation; total transport cost is then raised, through under-utilization of the stock of vehicles or inappropriate sizes, and aggregate producer surplus is encroached on.

Specifically, a pure tax on agricultural output and thus also full-cost pricing of agricultural transport are suboptimal; so is panterritorial pricing and the implied 100 percent subsidy on transport of crops. Further, demand estimates for purposes of transport investment appraisals should not be made independently of an investigation of the agricultural pricing system, particularly when the system is itself in process of change.

The boundaries of the region in which a particular crop is grown in a particular country may be determined in various ways, by the limits of the country's borders, by the limits of the land that is at all physically suitable for cultivation of the crop, or by the limits of the land on which it is economically profitable to grow the crop.

In the case of African countries, information with which to study the effect of transport policy on agricultural response at the farm level is largely unavailable, either because it has not been collected or because governments treat it as confidential. For practical reasons, therefore, the study of rural transport is largely restricted to data reported at a geographical level just below that of the region in which production occurs (termed zones productrices in the case of the CIDT) or to special studies of particular road projects. It is the purpose of this paper to see what can be learned about rural transport from the study of zonal data.",

This result is illustrated in Figure 1 for the special case of a =1 for two farms. The first is located right at the point of export (so that t, =0) and the other is located at t 2 =t kms from the point of export. If the government only uses an export tax, at rate r, then the loss in producers' surplus (the deadweight loss) is equal for each farm, area D. The revenue raised from the more remote farm is lower, however, and so the ratio of deadweight loss to revenue is disproportionately high for the remote farm. The government therefore has the opportunity to lower total deadweight loss while keeping its total revenues constant by increasing the tax on the near-in farm (which operates on a large base) while decreasing it on the remote one. As it does so, the deadweight loss rises and the revenue falls for the near-in farm while the opposite occurs for the remote one, until there is no net gain to continuing. The outcome is equivalent to a transport subsidy, and the geometry of Figure 1 can be used to prove the result of eqs. (9a-d): transport should be subsidized to the same degree that the export is taxed if the elasticity of supply is constant. In the particular case of a supply function with a constant elasticity, the optimal solution has all farmers paying the same tax, l-\\, as a proportion of their pre-tax farmgate price, and thereby reducing their production and producers' surplus by the same proportion. Therefore, the cost of transport must be subsidized so that the percentage tax on the farmgate price is constant regardless of the farmer's location; the linear eq. (9c) in conjunction with eqs. (9a) and (9b) does exactly this. Tables 1 and 2, eqs. (1)-(5), and various assumptions about the elasticity of supply, a in eq. (6), yield values for revenues, R, and producers' surplus, 11, under panterritorial pricing as given in Table 3 , col. 1. In addition, eqs. (9a-d) yield the value of the tax rate, l-), that produces the same revenue as that produced under panterritorial pricing, namely col. 2 of Table 3 .4 With such a X, the value of producers' surplus can be calculated under optimal pricing. For instance, Table 3 , cols. 1 and 2 show that the value of producers' surplus under optimal pricing is 1.0024 (=12.02921/12.00070) times the value of producers' surplus under panterritorial pricing when the elasticity of supply a =0.67. For o 1.33, probably quite a high value, the corresponding ratio is 1.0294. In other words, whether the CIDT pursues an optimal policy or one of panterritorial pricing seems to make relatively little difference to the value of the aggregate producers' surplus. Panterritorial pricing is, however, relatively less desirable the more elastic is supply, i.e., the more producers have scope for changing the volume of their output in response to the deviation between panterritorial pricing and the optimal spatial pattern of prices.",

It all depends on who owns what land and how much of it. For instance, if all farmers owned an equal share in land everywhere, a change in the distribution of producers' surplus among the zones would not affect the relative well-being of different farmers. In Africa, of course, the expectation is that small farmers depend entirely on agricultural land in one vicinity, so that changes in the distribution of producers' surplus at the zonal level would affect different farmers differently. This conclusion raises other questions: Do farmers in more remote regions have more land so that they are at least as well off as fa.rmers nearer in? Do they have other sources of income that make them at least as well off as farmers nearer in? In the CIDT zones, it would not be surprising if cotton is important in the incomes of these farmers and if poorer farmers live in more remote areas. If this were so, the distribution of income could become considerably more dispersed by the adoption of an optimal pricing policy while the gains in aggregate producers' surplus would be small, but I do not have the information to tell. What is clear is that if farmers' incomes are tied to land within zones rather than widely diversified across zones, considerable redistributions relative to the net gain would have to be engineered among farmers in different zones, and in a non-distorting way. Otherwise, the movement from panterritorial pricing to X-optimal pricing would not be a (pareto) improvement that makes no farmer worse off.",

In this case, an equal amount of revenue can be raised with an optimal pricing policy which has X = 0.418 in eqs.

For this value of at, the movement to revenue maximization (Table 4 , col. 1) brings a relatively small increase in revenue from the current situation (Table 3 , col. 1), but a relatively large decrease in producer surplus and a relatively large potential gain in producers' surplus from optimal pricing (Table 4, col. 2).

The calculations are made in Table  6 , and the answer is to remove the harvest from the nearby zone first because evacuating the nearby zone keeps the remote zone waiting less than the remote zone would keep the nearby zone waiting if it were evacuated first. I believe this result can be generalized easily to many zones at different distances with arbitrary harvest sizes and different truck availabilities.",

This may account for the bulk of the losses, or it may not. Presumably, the crop is most vulnerable to physical deterioration before it is processed, some crops more than others. In the case of cotton, important sources of postharvest loss, specifically rains and fires, cease after the crop leaves the farm. Furthermore, because farmers provide the storage facilities, the cost of preventing post-harvest losses occurs at the farm level. Also, interest rates that farmers face are presumably higher than those faced by the government, but, just as clearly the government does not face a zere rate of interest, and, so other tlhings equal, it benefits from a rapid movement of the cotton from the ginneries to the ports. (2) If it is optimal to operate all ginneries at full capacity as soon as it is possible, then enough transport must be allocated to supply all ginneries. The question is then not which ginneries should receive cotton first (a distance to the port question) but which zones should be first to provide cotton to the ginneries.

Table 5 , col. 2 provides the mean number of months after October 1 until the cotton is purchased by the CIDT, by zone, as well as statistics on this variable. If the cotton takes approximately the same amount of time to mature in each zone, then the difference between these two variables is a measure of the delay in evacuation. The correlation between this measure of delay and the distance of the zone from the ginnery is -0.50 with an extremely high statistical significance of 0.0001. An alternative measure of possible post-harvest loss from delayed evacuation is the mean number of months after April 1 until the crop is evacuated. Apparently, late March to mid-April initiates a period of heightened vulnerability to loss (DCGT, 1986, p. 10) . Again, the correlation between this measure of delay and distance from the ginnery is negative, -0.26, although with a reduced significance level of 0.06. Thus these two measures of the delay in harvest evacuation actually engendered by the CIDT are negatively related to distance while the considerations stressed in Table 6 and the accompanying discussion suggest that it is optimal that these correlations be positive. Why the CIDT decides to provide this spatial pattern of transport services, and whether it is indeed sub-optimal is something I have not been able to establish. The rates that the CIDT pays to private truckers provide incentives for the truckers to concentrate on long hlauls, leavinig the short hauls to the CIDT (DCGT, 1988, p.29) . It may be that the CIDT is not very efficient at this activity.

A correlation of this variable with the distance from the ginnery or either of the delay-in-evacuation variables produced entirely statistically insignificant results (0.55, 0.34 and 0.45 levels of significance, respectively), indicating no relationship between these variables. Of course, this finding does not mean that there are no costs from delayed evacuation. Quite to the contrary, the quality of the cotton is only one possible measure of losses from delayed evacuation and certainly reflects neither loss to fires nor foregone interest income, while quality itself reflects many other factors, perhaps primarily the care taken in harvesting rather than delay in evacuation.

By contrast, if a second depot paying the same price is located D from the ultimate destination (the absolutely worst place for it along the road), then all output of amount D/2 produced along the road from point D/2 to D is nearest to the second depot, and is brought there (D 2 /8 ton-km in total). 9 This output of amount D/2 produced from D/2 to D then has to be brought back a distance of D to the ultimate destination (D 2 12 ton-km.).

Transport costs rise by 50 percent in comparison to purchase at only the ultimate destination. Thus really large excess transport costs can be engendered by a combination of panterritorial pricing, few depots, and bad locations.
