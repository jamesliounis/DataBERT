The concepts and measures have begun to be used by policy institutions, including in specific sectors such as health and education. It is argued that one advantage of focusing on equality of opportunity is that policy makers are more responsive to that discourse than to equality of outcomes per se. This paper presents a critique of equality of opportunity in the policy context. Although the empirical analysis to which the literature has given rise is useful and is to be welcomed, current methods for quantifying and implementing the concept with a view to informing the policy discourse face a series of fundamental questions that remain unanswered. Without a full appreciation of these difficulties, the methods may prove to be misleading in the policy context.",

It is often contrasted with equality of outcomes, with the latter coming off worse. Equality of outcomes is seen variously as Utopian, as infeasible, as detrimental to incentives, and even as inequitable if outcomes are the result of differing efforts. Equality of opportunity, on the other hand, is interchangeable with phrases such as 'leveling the playing field', 'giving everybody an equal start' and 'making the most of inherent talents.' In its strongest form, the position is that equality of outcomes should be irrelevant to policy; what matters is equality of opportunity.",

The idea is that inequalities in outcomes are to be seen as just (or fair) insofar as they are driven by inequalities in the J's, and unjust (or unfair) insofar as they are driven by inequalities in the U's. The practical usefulness of the idea of inequality of opportunity boils down to two sets of questions: Is there agreement on the set of influences on the outcome in question and on whether each is a J or a U? And, conditional on a consensus or close to a consensus on these questions, can the inequalities be partitioned empirically in a fashion that is credible and meaningful for policy?",

As a result, while appearing to resolve the key conceptual questions, many of the philosophical discussions in the literature actually leave many key questions unanswered. Thus while this section, which focuses on the philosophical underpinnings of equality of opportunity, will highlight some of the conceptual issues involved, it will not resolve them all. Only after we have gone through the empirical applications in the next two sections will the full gamut of conceptual difficulties become apparent.",

        "text": "The modern flowering of the equality of opportunity literature in economics owes much to the work of Roemer (1998) , who is recognized for example by the authors of the World Development Report 2006 (see World Bank, 2005 Bourguignon, Ferreira and Walton, 2007) . Roemer sets out ideas on both questions. The central conceptual distinction in Roemer is to \"separate the influences on the outcome a person experiences into circumstances and effort: the former are attributes of a person's environment for which he should not be held responsible, and effort is the choice variable for which he should be held responsible\" (Roemer, 2008) . It is this distinction which Roemer, and followers like de Barros et. al. (2009) , attempt to implement in empirical policy oriented work. Roemer (1998) also suggests a way to partition inequalities empirically into justifiable inequalities (in his book, inequalities in effort) and unjustifiable inequalities (in his book inequalities in circumstances), from which he arrives at a measure of inequality of opportunity. He addresses the question of how exactly to calibrate the effort of an individual, and argues that the rank of an individual in the effort distribution across individuals with the same circumstances should be the relevant metric. De Barros et. al. (2009) use alternative metrics which we will discuss below. But the applications all rely on the assumption that circumstances and effort can indeed be separated. While the concepts are clear in principle, as we shall see the applications invariably raise the question of whether they can ever be separated in practice, or even conceptually. And as we will also see, questions arise as to whether there is more to the J vs. U distinction than 'circumstances' vs. 'effort.'",

For example, if a person would be deeply unhappy if unable to drive fast cars, this should not arouse an egalitarian sentiment to transfer resources to this person.

But Friedman's pure case is nevertheless useful for smoking out core intuitions on whether outcomes or opportunities matter more. Suppose in the pure case one of the outcomes is destitution -below a poverty line, say. Recall that by construction there is perfect equality before the lottery. Further, all individuals freely choose to participate in the lottery. To use the terminology of Dworkin (1981b) , this is \"option luck\", chosen by the individual, not \"brute luck\" over which the individual has no control. And yet, upon exercising this free choice starting with perfect equality, after the lottery is drawn not only is there inequality, but some are destitute. The outcome is brutal even though the luck was not brute. When faced with such destitution, do our moral intuitions guide us to redistribute after the event, or do they guide us to stand firm because to redistribute would be in effect to deny the consequences of equality of opportunity (and the consequences of the doctrine of responsibility for actions as advanced by Dworkin)? Kanbur (1987) has argued that in the case of destitution as an outcome of the lottery choice, our moral intuitions do indeed veer towards ex post redistribution and support for the destitute. To emphasize the point, imagine yourself serving on a soup line of the indigent. Consider then the idea that we would condition the doling out of soup on an assessment of whether it was circumstance or effort which led to the outcome of the individual in front of us to be in the soup line. Surely this is morally repugnant, and it establishes that at least for extreme outcomes the outcome based perspective dominates any considerations of opportunity. Indeed, this point is taken on board by Bourguignon, Ferreira and Walton (2007) in their definition of equitable development policy which \"makes avoidance of severe deprivation a constraint that must be satisfied in the process of pursuing the broader objective of equal opportunity.\"",

If parents engage in the Friedman lottery, the outcomes will lead to inequality among their children even though, by construction, there is perfect equality of circumstance among the parents.

The lottery outcomes are now the circumstances of the children. The doctrine of equality of opportunity would now lead us to redistribute in order to address inequality of circumstance among children. But, equally, it would lead us not to redistribute across parents because to do so would be \"equivalent to denying them the opportunity to enter the lottery.\" Equality of opportunity, it would seem, is caught between two inconsistent Old Testament Biblical injunctions from Deuteronomy: \"for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me\" versus \"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.\"",

We cannot say how far the IEO of a specific country at a specific date falls short of its true value.

These are either affordable by society at large already, or could be in the near future, given the available technology. Universal provision of basic opportunities is a valid and realistic social goal. In the case of children, most societies agree on the importance of a set of basic opportunities, at least at the level of intentions; even if different societies might have different standards about the right set of basic opportunities, there is some global consensus on a few of them, just as there is consensus regarding the Millennium Development Goals. Here we include as basic opportunities variables related to education (completion of sixth grade on time, and school attendance at ages 10-14) and housing conditions (access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity).\" (p. 3)",

This predicted probability is then compared to the average probability of access across all circumstance variables. The differences in the predicted probability relative to the average are then used to construct a measure of inequality in access, and this is the inequality of opportunity. The specific measure used is a form of dissimilarity index based on the absolute difference between each individual value and the average. The authors further argue that the average access measure can be deflated by the dissimilarity index to give a measure of effective access correcting for inequality of opportunity -their Human Opportunity Index (HOI).",

In the limit, if enough variables are used, each child's access can be predicted perfectly so we are measuring inequality of the binary variable access/no access.

By contrast, in their IEO exercise they group inequalities in educational attainment at age 15 with inequalities in income, and in both cases strip out the contribution from inequality of circumstance; the rationale in both cases is that the part of the inequality due to inequality in effort is not unjust. Roemer (1998) -whose work inspired de Barros et al. (2009) -has a different viewpoint. He argues that insofar as they reflect inequalities in parental pressure or influence, inequalities in childhood outcomes (including presumably inequalities among young teenagers) should be counted as inequalities in circumstance not as inequalities in effort; Roemer would want to extract from the inequality in outcome both the part caused by inequality in circumstance and the part caused by inequality in parental pressure.

The risks associated with smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are well known and well publicized, but the evidence on diet is more complex, more fluid, and less well publicized. For example, given the attention they receive in the media, one might imagine the big culprits in relation to diet are too little polyunsaturated fatty acid, and too much processed meat, trans-fatty acids, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat. Yet these are not actually the biggest causes of diet-related deaths worldwide: over six times as many deaths are attributable to people consuming too much sodium, and too little fruit, nuts, seeds, vegetables and whole grains (Lim et al., 2014) . These issues aside, should we hold people accountable for bad luck, or only for risky behavior? De Barros et al. (2009) and Friedman (1962) argue the former. But there is an alternative school of thought that argues the opposite (see e.g. Le Grand 1987; Cappelen and Norheim 2005) , namely that holding people accountable for outcomes is too strong, and that people should not be held accountable for their bad luck (\"brute luck\" as Dworkin calls it); in this view, luck is just one of the many of Roemer's \"circumstances beyond a person's control.\" Insofar as is feasible, smokers and drinkers should, according to this viewpoint, receive whatever additional health care is required to reduce their odds of premature death to the odds faced by everyone else. The accountability for risky behavior (\"option luck\" as Dworkin calls it) comes in through taxation: consumption of tobacco and alcohol (as well as e.g. sodium, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, etc.) should be taxed at such a rate that the revenues cover the extra expected health care costs.",
