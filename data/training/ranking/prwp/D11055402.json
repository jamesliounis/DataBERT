Gollin [14] questioned these estimations by arguing that the widely used approach, which is based on Cobb-Douglas production functions, tends to underestimate the labor income of self-employed workers, and the corrected labor shares fall in the range of 0.65 to 0.80. This evidence was later reaffirmed by Bernanke and Gurkaynak [3] , but rejected by Ortega and Rodriguez [27] . The latter uses industrial survey data to explore the same question, and controlling for the measurement problem of self-employed workers it found a significant negative cross-sectional relationship between capital share and per capita income within industries. In a related paper, Dobbelaere and Mairesse [9] , find that imperfections in the product and labor markets generate a wedge between factor elasticities in the production function and their corresponding shares in revenue, at firm and industry levels.",

The modern formulation of this theory has been presented by Acemoglu [1] , who study how cross-country differences in factor endowments bias technical change. In his framework, the price and market-size effects determine the direction of technological change. The price effect reflects the incentives to generate technologies that create more expensive goods. The second effect captures the incentives to produce technologies for which there is a big mar-ket. While the former encourages innovations to complement scarce factors, the latter leads to technical change favoring abundant factors. The elasticity of substitution between different factors determines the relative magnitudes of these effects. In the long run, technical change favors the abundant factor if the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently large.",

Unskilled-labor abundance is a source of comparative advantage for countries above the median of the capital/labor ratio and IPRs, while it is a source of comparative disadvantage for countries below the median.

That is, these variables could be correlated with our selection-equation regressors, our previous results could suffer from omitted variables bias, and the estimated heterogeneous Rybczynski coefficients could be due to these other factors. Two additional specifications test the robustness of our results. The first adds the wage/lending rate ratio to the set of explanatory variables in the selection equation. The second adds national TFP levels to the previous set of regressors. Table 9 reports these results.",

This is partly due to differences in factor endowments, as in Schott's multiplecone model of international specialization with identical technologies across countries.
