The World Health Organization (2016) attributes about 3.3 million annual premature deaths to outdoor air pollution in low-and middle-income countries: 72% from heart disease and strokes, 14% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 14% from lung cancer. The World Bank (2016) estimates welfare losses from ambient fine particulate and ozone pollution at 4.8% of GDP equivalent in East Asia, 3.5% in South Asia, 2.1% in the Middle East and North Africa, 1.6% in Latin America and 1.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

Although researchers and policy makers are sensitive to this spatial component, incomplete information has hindered their attempts to identify and implement cost-effective strategies for pollution control. Local pollution is often poorly measured because monitoring systems are sparse, costly and difficult to maintain. Since this problem is pervasive in developing countries, rigorous empirical analyses of alternative strategies are rare. For decision making, policy makers need frequently updated information on the sources, dispersion and distributional implications of pollution.",

For example, high-resolution satellite imagery permits frequently-updated observations of polluting aerosols worldwide. Appropriately mobilized and interpreted, data from such sources could elevate the state of the art in pollution research, policy analysis and implementation. However, before these sources come into widespread use, empirical tests are needed to assess their operational utility, including accuracy testing against benchmarks provided by ground-based measurement. This paper assesses the potential for low-cost augmentation of ground-based air quality monitoring in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with more comprehensive coverage from global information sources. We test the potential contributions of two satellite information platforms: Sentinel-5P, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), and NASA's MODIS. Our assessment includes four dimensions:",

        "text": "Our analysis focuses on two health-critical air pollutants, fine particulates (PM2.5) and NO2, that are measured by ground monitoring in Dhaka. Among widely-measured air pollutants, the international health community currently believes particulate air pollution to be the most damaging. It is a complex mixture of small and large particles of varying origin and chemical composition. Over time, health research has narrowed its focus from all particles, to particles less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), to fine particles whose diameters are less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). 2 Coal-fired power plants and motor vehicles are the largest sources of PM2.5 (WHO 1997 , World Resources 1998 . Fine particles are more dangerous because they can penetrate deeply into the lungs, settling in areas where natural clearance mechanisms cannot remove them. The constituent elements of small particles also tend to be more chemically active and therefore more damaging (WHO 1997 , World Resources 1998 . Many studies have found that exposure to particulates is strongly associated with mortality and morbidity (Wells 1994; World Bank 1996; Cropper et al. 1997; Ostro 1999; Kappos et al. 2004; Pui et al. 2014; Boldo et al. 2006; Lua et al. 2015; Franklin et al. 2007) . Identified health effects range in severity from coughing and bronchitis to heart disease and lung cancer. In addition, the research has found no \"critical threshold\" that governs safe exposure to particulate pollution. Damage increases with exposure, starting at very low concentration levels.",

Then we weight the speeds in Table 1 by the color pixel shares and compute the composite weighted average speed for the hour. Figure 3 provides a summary of traffic data for the .01-degree cell surrounding the CAMS-3 monitoring station. The figure displays hourly median and 1st-quartile traffic speeds. Several features of the display are evident. First, each day the average speed varies from about 15 km/hr to 37 km/hr. Second, a regular pattern recurs from Sunday to Thursday: Average traffic speed reaches maximum levels from midnight to 4 AM; falls rapidly to a minimum from 8 to 10 AM; rises to somewhat higher speeds from noon to 4PM; falls to another minimum from 8 to 11 PM; and then rises rapidly. Third, the pattern on Friday and Saturday is distinctly different: Average speed falls steadily from around 4 AM until 8-11 PM. Finally, the worst traffic conditions are somewhat more volatile on Friday and Saturday, with more rapid afternoon declines in the first quartile measure.",

Our primary estimates use variable levels, but we also include estimates for time-differenced 7 variables to test the possible effect of serial correlation on the parameter estimates. The time-differenced version provides a weaker test of the weather variables, whose dominant variation is seasonal rather than hourly. Table 4 shows that all variables in the two levels equations are highly significant, while traffic speed has similar parameter estimates and high significance in the difference equations. As expected, weather-related variations in measured pollution are statistically weaker in the timedifference variant. We summarize the overall implications of our results in Table 5 , which reports pollution predictions across the full range of traffic speeds. The second and third columns report predicted PM2.5 and NO2 for the CAMS-3 area at mean values of the weather variables. The predictions for least congestion (40 km/hr) provide baseline values for PM2.5 and NO2 that incorporate weather effects, vehicular emissions on uncongested roads, and emissions from other sources. 8 Our results suggest very large incremental effects for traffic congestion: From the least-to most-congested cases, PM2.5 more than doubles, from 55 to 124 ug/m 3 . The proportional change is even greater for NO2, which increases from 12 to 31 ppb. Table 5 : Predicted NO2 and PM2.5 for the CAMS-3 area 8 We focus on vehicle emissions as a PM2.5 source in this paper, and our results provide strong evidence that the link between daily traffic fluctuations and fluctuations in PM2.5 is highly significant. However, our results do not imply that vehicle emissions have unique significance for PM2.5 pollution in Dhaka. Brickworks are another frequentlycited source of PM2.5 in the region and their emissions are undoubtedly included in the PM2.5 baseline value reported in Table 5 . This value is already much higher than the WHO reference standard for PM2.5; vehicle emissions simply add another highly-significant component to the total. ",

For daily matching, we have computed means for CAMS-3 and Google Traffic observations at 1 and 2 PM. The result of this necessary matching exercise is great disparity in available daily observations. For the Sentinel-5P regression, there are 362 CAMS-3 observations, along with predictions from 434 and 406 observations for the S5P aerosol index and tropospheric NO2 measure. For the Google Traffic (GT) regressions, which use GT data for two periods in 2019, CAMS-3 provides observations from 1 PM, 2 PM or both for 34 days.

The common pattern is clear: Increases from minimum to maximum measures for the global technologies translate to increases from safe to hazardous levels in local pollution. At the high end, another pattern emerges: Beyond the 90th percentile, observed values are generally greater than predicted values. This implies that large positive outliers are more common when predicted pollution is higher, but the predicted values are already quite hazardous. To illustrate, consider the maximum Google Traffic prediction of PM 2.5 in Table 6 : 210 ug/m 3 . This far exceeds the WHO health standard (WHO 2005) and matches the 99th-percentile measure for CAMS-3. However, a few large positive outliers drive the CAMS-3 maximum to 306. This may reflect random technical variation, measurement error, or spikes in nearby emissions that our methodology cannot capture. Note: The CAMS-3 columns in Table 7 differ from those in Table 6 because the comparison data samples differ. In summary, our results show that all three global technologies (Sentinel-5P, MODIS, Google Traffic), when combined with commonly-available weather data, provide statistically-robust and conservative PM2.5 predictions that identify hazardous conditions with high likelihood. At the same time, some global technologies perform better than others in our analysis. In the higher percentiles, predictions from MODIS AOD and the Google Traffic congestion index come closer to the CAMS-3 observations than the Sentinel-5P aerosol index or NO2 measure.",
