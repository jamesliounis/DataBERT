        "text": "Turkey liberalized its capital account in 1989, taking an important step in its efforts to integrate its economy with the rest of the world. Since then capital inflows increased significantly and the financial system became increasingly linked with external markets. While in most other emerging market economies financial opening was accompanied or preceded by fiscal and structural reforms, this was not the case in Turkey. The new regime began under conditions of chronic and high inflation that averaged about 70 percent in the late 1980s. Due to persistently poor public finances, this situation continued throughout the 1990s and achieving stabilization still remains a challenge. The financial sector has been operating in this unstable environment and reforms to ensure its soundness have been uneven. Liberalization of interest rates, easing entry of new foreign and local banks, and permits for new products and services in the early 1980s led to a more dynamic financial sector. However, improvements to the legal and supervisory frameworks to anticipate and deal with weaknesses in the banking system have not been fully sufficient. Transparency, consolidated supervision, orderly exit mechanisms, and accounting standards are still policy issues to be addressed.",

        "text": "Turkey's experience with capital flows raises interesting questions. To begin with, what factors account for capital inflows with poor fiscal fundamentals? What are the characteristics of such flows and how did they impact consumption, investment and growth? An analysis of economic management during the 1989-1997 period in general and the post 1994 crisis period in particular is also called for, in order to draw policy lessons and to offer some thoughts for a possible stabilization program. There are also important issues related to the financial sector. How did capital flows, the volatile economic environment, and regulatory policies affect the system's operations? Has the financial sector become weaker and exposed to higher currency and credit risk as a result of real exchange rate targeting policy? These are the main questions we attempt to answer in this paper. In light of the current global financial turmoil, our goal is to assess emerging vulnerabilities that relate to capital flows in the Turkish financial system.",

Although the authority's conscious policy in recent years of maintaining external competitiveness helped reduce the currency's vulnerability to speculative attacks, it led to an economy that lacks a nominal anchor. Capital flows also enabled the country to delay its structural reforms. The failure of successive governments to deal with structural problems resulted in the economy operating under a cloud of vulnerability, particularly in terms of the worsening debt dynamics. In other words, the underlying causes of stop-go stabilization policies, which generate considerable uncertainty about the overall policy framework, and volatile economic growth, are still present.",

As a result of predictable depreciation of the currency, banks borrow at cheaper rates abroad and lend it at high rates domestically, expecting to earn more in net interest income than they lose from currency depreciation. As a result of the moral hazard created by extensive government guarantees and the lack of effective prudential regulation and supervision, the banks take on substantial risks in their interest rate exposures due to maturity mismatches, in unhedged foreign currency positions, and in potential loan losses. Such risks and the existence of large confidence-sensitive claims by nonresidents make the banking sector vulnerable to business cycles and shifts in market sentiment. Although the state banks have much less exposure in market risks, their operations are distorted by their heavy involvement in quasi-fiscal activities and the failure of the government to reimburse the banks for the subsequent \"duty losses\". Their losses are a major source of liquidity risk to the banking system.",

Section II presents the basic capital inflows and outflows data and, discusses the main characteristics of these flows and provides a decomposition of the capital account. In section III the setting for capital account liberalization and the initial conditions with regard to the key macroeconomic aggregates are presented, followed by some econometric evidence on the determinants of capital flows. Section IV discusses the effects of capital flows on consumption and investment. Section V turns to macroeconomic management issues, including the exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policies, that relate to capital flows and point out macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Section VI turns to the financial sector and analyzes banking intermediation of capital flows and issues surrounding the process. Section VII concludes.",

First of all, capital flows have been very much a two-way phenomenon. While inflows have been much larger than outflovvs, Turkish investments abroad were also substantial in a number of years. Turkish banks made large investments in foreign assets before 1994, and Turkish portfolio investments in foreign securities (particularly debt securities) reached more than one billion US dollars in 1996.

The last three years in the table show a larger allocation to reserve growth compared to the current account. This is consistent with the post crisis policy of keeping the real exchange rate constant, which resulted in heavy foreign exchange intervention. Since inflows were particularly strong in 1995-1997, the extent of reserve accumulation has been substantial, as seen in Table 6 . In the pre-crisis period, in the years which saw heavy inflows such as 1993 and 1990, larger shares were for current account deficit allocation as opposed to reserve accumulation. Chart 1 shows the evolution of the capital account and its allocation between current account and reserve accumulation. The large and increasing size of recorded trade deficits of the recent years (which now include an estimate of shuttle trade) with respect to capital inflows are noteworthy. Financing of the trade deficits was made possible by the strong positive balance on the invisibles account, especially non-interest and non-tourism revenues. Part of these were likely to be short-term capital flows, which could be subject to sudden reversals.

Estimation was done for total, portfolio and short term capital flows, using monthly data for 1990-1997 as well as foreign direct investment using quarterly data for the period 1990-19973. The results are presented in Table 8. 2 No objective behind the move to a (managed) float from a real exchange rate targeting rule was ever officially announced. With increasing capital inflows, the feasibility of real exchange raLte depreciation had decreased substantially and the Central Bank seemed not to have another option but allow for some real appreciation. Since portfolio flows are mainly composed of debt instruments placed by Turkish residents in foreign markets, foreign interest rates are likely to be most relevant measure of opportunity costs of these flows. Therefore we broke down the uncovered differential into the continued As expected, the uncovered T-bill interest differential is significant in explaining short term capital flows. Total capital flows turned out to be significantly explained by the lagged first difference of the interest differential, not its lagged level. Growth rate of real GDP, however, does not significantly (at 10 percent level) affect short term or total capital flows. The insignificance of the growth of real GDP variable stands in contrast to some other country studies (see for example Corbo and Desormeaux 1996) and seems to be suggestive of the fact that, the most important pull factor of capital flows is the short run interest rate differential rather than growth opportunities in the economy.

The abandonment of the real exchange rate rule in 1989 coupled with liberalization of the capital account indeed led to sharp real appreciation during 1989-90 which continued at a more moderate scale until 1994. With no fiscal adjustment and the persistence of high inflation, choosing the exchange rate (govemed with a managed float) as an implicit nominal anchor inevitably led to such real appreciation when combined with capital inflows. This policy process backfired when further deterioration of the fiscal stance combined with government's attempt to control interest rates on its domestic bonds-a fundamental policy error when capital account is open-led to a correction of the real exchange rate in the 1994 financial crisis, which is clearly visible in Chart 3.

Another mechanism seems to have the wealth and income affects that has been due to the domestic and asset yield differentials, which we found in section III.2 to be the key factor pulling capital inflows to Turkey.

Chart 4 compares three month T-bills real rates in TL (i.e., after adjusting for inflation), three month T-bill return in US$ (i.e., after adjusting for lira depreciation), and the LIBOR. It is clear that Turkish rates, ex-post, have been high by international standards since 1989. It is also visible that there has been a large volatility and in a few occasions returns have been negative in real terms. While high real rates have been a source of concern, the discussion in Turkey has rarely been in an open economy context and policymakers often ignored or did not fully grasp the implications of open capital account for interest rate determination -lack of such an understanding was the reason behind the policymakers attempt to manipulate the auction rates of T-bills in 1993/1994 which triggered the currency crisis. 9 See Calvo and Vegh (1993) . Given the oDpenness of financial markets in Turkey, the starting point is the uncovered interest parity condition. It states that with no barriers to capital mobility, risk neutrality, and no country risk, returns for simtilar types and maturity of assets would be equalized through arbitrage, and deviations from parity will be unpredictable and white noise (Frankel & Okongwu 1995 , Edwards, 1998 .

Capital flows to T urkey have been associated with large public sector borrowing requirements and over time external flows became increasingly important in financing the deficits. This situation distorted the flow of funds in the domestic financial system in favor of the public sector. The large borrowing requirements have also been associated with growing share of interest payments, and large turnover of domestic debt. While a significant portion of capital account have been short term borrowing and short term portfolio flows, a predominant share of domestic public debt has been of short term maturity.

After 1991, the primary stance of the government worsened, which contributed to the risk premium in real interest rates, and the budgetary burden of interest payments increased considerably. Both in 1992 and 1993 the primary budget balance was negative and PSBR started to increase rapidly, coming close to 12 percent of GNP. Rather than reducing expenditures, in mid-1993, the government started to resort to heavier Central Bank financing of the deficits, as interest payments were identified as a potential area for savings. Despite the deterioration in fundamentals, the government refused to pay higher interest rates in the debt auctions in late 1993, and canceled several auctions altogether.",

This has been the fastest growing component of domestic debt and its fast growth implies that the costs of debt service have been increasing rapidly. The fact that there is a primary surplus now but the PSBR is close to 10 percent of GNP (as of last quarter of 1998) is a clear sign of the high financing costs. While debt/output ratio in Turkey is still manageable at about 35% of GNP, the recent rate of growth of debt is a serious source of concern.",

As the public sector dissaved during last decade there were corresponding increases in the share of private savings. Celasun and Tansel (1993) show that there has been a strong link between real interest rates and private saving, which indicates that private savings will come at a high cost. Putting these two factors together it is easy to argue that rolling over the domestic debt stock will be a serious challenge given the heavy burden of public debt service (estimated to be around US$27-30 billion in the first half of 1999). Further, locking in high interest rates now will complicate a possible disinflation program as real interest burden will rise as inflation falls. Hence, swapping the expensive domestic debt with cheaper foreign sources of financing would need to be a key component of a credible stabilization program.",

By the end of 1997, commercial banks had a net repo position with private sector customers of US$ 10 -39billion (11% of total assets). Thus the exposure of the banking sector to the government securities market is at least as large off-balance sheet as on-balance sheet. The importance of the govermment debt market to the banking sector is also reflected in the observation that 25% and 22% of total interest income came from investment in government securities in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The volatility of inflation has also induced lenders to include in interest rates a premium to cover their uncertainty which together with other factors, such as the government demand for funds, has resulted in very high real interest rates, which is already analyzed in more detail in section IV. The high domestic interest rates, real exchange rate appreciation, and tax distortions have induced banks to borrow abroad to finance both domestic loans and positions in the government paper market. Some of the exchange rate risk on the loans is reduced by lending foreign exchange but the banks do have foreign exchange risk to the extent they use foreign borrowing to finance their purchases of government paper. In using the government securities for overnight repos, the banks also expose themselves to interest rate risk.",

Many Turkish banks made substantial investment in government Eurobond issues motivated by tax advantages.

A country may become financially vulnerable externally if there are large risks in its financial system that constrain foreign exchange liquidity. As we can see from earlier sections, foreign loans and credits to Turkey have been rather volatile, and Turkey experienced a sharp reversal of capital flows and a severe currency crisis in 1994. As a result, there was a sharp contraction of credit to the real sector and real economic activity contracted by 6% in that year. In this section we assess the liquidity risks, particularly foreign exchange liquidity risks, currently facing the Turkish banking system, and the ability of the commercial banks and the authorities to handle those risks.",

In particular, many private-sector banks run large currency and interest rate risk positions than would be considered prudent in most countries. A number of banks run open foreign exchange positions that exceed the already generous regulatory limit of 50% of capital. 2 0 Such behavior is also a reflection of moral hazard as a result of the existence of extensive govemment guarantee on deposits and regulatory forbearance.

Virtually all of the risk-taking banks are positioned in the same direction, holding short foreign currency positions and borrowing short and lending/investing long. Moreover, these banks are the dominant players in both currency and government securities markets. Therefore, if there is a strong rate movement against either or both of these risk positions, the banking sector may move in unison to shed it holdings, pushing the lira down and interest rates up, and leaving the Central Bank as the sole stabilizing force in the market.

Commercial banks' claim on the private sector grew in real terms by 44% in 1995 (which might to a large extent reflected making up for the sharp contraction of 32% in lending to the private sector in 1994 ), 28% in 1996, and 22% in 1997. Thus the growth in bank credit to the private sector exceeded by a wide margin the already rapid growth of GNP. The credit growth rates were very high as compared to other large capital importers. The nature of such lending is not clear (in terms of sectoral concentration, etc), but it is noteworthy that consumer lending has assumed increasing importance. Though consumer credits have been only a small part of the total lending (about 9% as of end 1997), the volume of consumer credits have been growing very fast -from US$1.9 billion as of end 1996 to US$2.9 billion as of end 1997 (a growth rate of 53%). Such a high credit growth rate may not augur well for credit quality. Turkish banks may be subject to large credit losses if economic activity slows down, for example, due to business cycle reasons. To what extent have capital inflows contributed to such high growth in domestic credit? It is clear that lending to the private sector could not have grown by as much as it did in 1992, 1993, and 1997, without the funds borrowed from abroad. In 1997, lending to the private sector increased by US$5.6 billion and investments in government securities increased by US$1.8 billion, whereas domestic liabilities increased by only US$2.2 billion. Without the increase in foreign liabilities of US$3.3 billion, the growth in domestic credit would not have been possible. Equally important, reversal of foreign inflows in 1994 (an outflow from the banking sector of US$6 billion) was the main reason for the sharp contraction in lending to the private sector (a decrease of 32% in real terms). In 1995, the growth in domestic credit was funded primarily by the growth in domestic liabilities. The situation in 1996 was less clear, but it would be true to say that without the foreign financing of US$2.8 billion, total domestic claims (investment in government securities and lending to the private sector) could not have grown as much as they did.",

Most of Interbank's problems arose from a large exposure to its parent company, Nergis Holding, one of the largest textile companies in Turkey. The latter was severely affected by the downturn in the industry that followed the Asian crisis. Connected lending and concentrated credit portfolios exposed the banks to imprudent concentration of credit risks.
