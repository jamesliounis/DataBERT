  "abstract": "The benefits of cross-listing for a foreign \"issuer\" are extensively documented in the literature, however it is not clear what motivates \"investors\" to hold American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) rather than the underlying stock of these issuers. We analyze the investment allocation decision of mutual fund managers to invest in emerging market firms that are listed in their domestic markets and have also issued ADRs in the U.S. Although legal provisions are typically assumed to affect ADRs and their underlying domestic shares equally, investors holding ADRs may have a higher level of legal protection as these securities are issued and traded in the U.S. We find that ADRs are the preferred mode of holdings if the local market of the issuer has weak investor protection, low liquidity and high transaction costs, and if the firm is small and has limited analyst following. We also find that not all ADR listings are associated with low liquidity in the underlying security. In fact, firms with strong liquidity for their underlying security are likely to be held via their underlying security rather than the ADRs. This suggests that ADR listings of local firms might not negatively impact local markets if the investment climate is good.",

        "text": "It is estimated that in 2003 U.S. investors allocated eleven to twelve percent of their total equity portfolio to non-U.S. equities. Institutional investors' purchases of foreign equities in 2003 amounted to $1,300 billion according to the U.S. Federal Reserve's Flow of U.S. investors interested in investing in a foreign firm (one based outside the U.S.) can do so by purchasing ADRs in the U.S., or by purchasing the underlying stock in the home market of the firm, or by doing both. This paper examines the factors that affect an institutional investor's choice of investment security, i.e. investing in the ADR versus investing in the underlying shares of an emerging market firm. Thus, we are interested in the question of how a fund manager, once she has decided to invest in a company cross-listed in the U.S., chooses to divide that investment amount between the ADR share and the non-ADR shares (primarily the underlying domestic share that trades on the home stock exchange of the issuer) of that company. The factors that affect fund managers' choice of a particular firm have been addressed by Aggarwal, Klapper and Wyscocki (2004) , our focus is the determinants of security choice (the ADR versus the underlying).",

Coffee (1999) suggests that U.S. securities law provides additional protection to investors if the firm is listed in the U.S. and argues that firms from countries with weak shareholder protection laws can effectively \"bond\" themselves to the more stringent U.S. laws. This implies that on the margin, ADR holders have better legal standing compared to holders of the underlying security as the ADRs are purchased in the U.S. This line of argument implies that fund managers should prefer ADRs of firms from countries with weak legal protection for shareholders. A recent example of such SEC enforcement is the case SEC brought against TV Azteca, a Mexican firm, in January 2005 alleging self dealing and insider trading by Company's officers and Directors. Yet another example is the ability of US security holders of Bre-X, a Canadian mining company, to sue in a US court while the Canadian security holders did not get that privilege.",

        "text": "However, Siegel (2004a Siegel ( , 2004b ) using a sample of Mexican firms, finds that crosslisting is associated with higher probability of asset stealing by controlling shareholders (thus causing significant wealth loss for minority shareholders). Furthermore, he reports that the SEC rarely prosecutes transgressions of U.S. listed foreign firms. 2 Siegel's findings suggest that investors should not expect significant benefits from investing in ADRs of cross-listed firms as the enhanced legal protection is not significant. This debate provides conflicting predictions about the effect of a country's legal system (in particular its investor protection/corporate governance laws) and a U.S. investor's choice of investing security (ADR versus underlying) for cross-listed firms from that country. The effect of local laws may be hard to identify, since the development of a country's stock exchange (reflected in transaction costs and liquidity of that exchange) may in turn be related to the legal origins of that country. La Porta et al. (1997) report that, on average, countries with English common law origin have more developed financial markets. Thus, to the extent that legal origin is a proxy for the quality of a country's stock exchange, it may exert an additional effect (independent of the better investor protection effect) on the investment allocation pattern of U.S. investors.",

Financial institutions that offer depositary services such as Bank of New York, Citicorp, and JP Morgan, frequently stress the advantages of an ADR program for potential investors on measures such as liquidity, transparency and ease of trading. 3 Industry participants also point to the lower costs of executing trades as a major factor in their preference for an ADR over the domestic security, for issuers from countries with stock exchanges with high transaction costs. However, we are not aware of any empirical work that provides evidence to confirm or dispute these assertions. This paper seeks to address this gap in our understanding of how professional fund managers allocate their investment between ADR securities and non-ADR securities.",

A key result of their model is that when several markets compete for order flow of the same security, the exchange offering the lowest transaction costs attracts liquidity traders which in turn induces informed traders to also move to that exchange (in order to camouflage their private information). Thus, one exchange emerges as the dominant exchange in which the bulk of trading is concentrated. 7 This implies that for an issuer from a country with a stock exchange that has high transaction costs, the U.S. stock exchange (where its ADR is traded) may become the dominant exchange, at least for U.S. investors.

The second decision can depend on both country and firm-level factors.

As previously discussed, there is a dispute in the literature: Coffee (1999 Coffee ( , 2002a Coffee ( , 2002b argues that a U.S. listing provides significant protection to minority investors, since an ADR listing makes a firm subject to rule 10b-5, which gives shareholders the right to sue for losses ensued because of fraudulent statements made by a company whose shares they own. 12 On the contrary, Siegel (2004a) reports that in the case of Mexican firms, cross-listing in the U.S. is associated with higher probability of asset stealing by the insiders.

To estimate the relative weighting of investments in ADR versus the domestic security for this firm we follow a two step process. In the first step, for each fund k we calculate the total dollar amount of investment (sum of investment in ADR and underlying) in firm i, that a fund holds. We then calculate the fraction of that investment in the ADR and the fraction in the underlying for that fund. Next, we take the difference between the fraction of investment in the ADR versus the domestic stock. This difference reflects the relative over or underweighting in ADR for that fund. We repeat this process for all of the k funds, thus generating the relative over or under allocation of investment in ADRs for each fund. In the second step, we take a simple average of these k values to get the aggregate measure of over/underweighting across all funds that invest in the firm i and denote it by (ADR Differential).

Telemex is held by 79 funds and the total investment in this firm is $363 million. Of this $363 million, $344 million is held as ADRs and $19 million is held as the underlying security. Thus, (ADR_RATIO) Telmex equals 0.94 ($344/$363). For calculating (ADR Differential) Telmex we need to calculate the difference in the fraction of investment held in ADR and the fraction of investment held in the underlying for each fund. Of the 79 funds, 70 hold only the ADR. Thus the ADR differential for each of these funds is 1 (fraction held in ADR -fraction held in underlying). 7 funds hold only the underlying which implies that ADR differential for each of these funds is -1. Remaining two funds hold both ADR and underlying of Telmex, with ADR differential of -0.94 and 0.15. The calculation of (ADR Differential) Telmex is as follows:",

        "text": "The example of Telmex also illustrates that a predominant fraction of funds (70 out of 79) invest in Telmex through its ADR. In other firms the opposite is true, i.e. most funds hold only the underlying security rather than the ADR. For example, consider the case of Advanced Semiconductor, a Taiwan-based semiconductor fabricator. There are 16 funds that hold a total of $8.2 million in this firm and of which only $0.1 million is held in the form of the ADR. Of the 16 funds, 14 hold only the underlying and one fund holds only the ADR while one fund holds both. For Advanced Semiconductor the ADR_Differential and ADR_RATIO are -0.83 and 0.01 respectively. These examples highlight an interesting feature of ADR holding patterns observed in our sample. For a typical issuer, any single fund in 38 cases every fund that invests in these firms invests only in the underlying shares of these firms. For 22 firms all the funds that invest in these firms hold only the ADR. Thus for nearly half of the sample of ADR issuers the fund holding is exclusively in either the underlying or the ADR. Figure 3 plots the number of firms against the aggregate dollar amount invested by funds in the ADR of these firms. Again, we observe the same concentration of investment in either the ADR or the underlying. At the individual issuer level this pattern of strong preference of either the ADR or the underlying is clearly evident, however we find that at the fund level there are no clear preferences for holding ADRs or the underlying local shares. We do not, for example, find funds that specifically invest only in ADRs. Most funds hold both underlying and ADR securities. The average and median percent holdings of ADRs across funds is 29%, with a standard deviation of 10%. These summary statistics suggest that a funds decision to hold ADRs versus underlying shares is influenced by country and firm level characteristics.",

The investor protection offered by a country's laws may have an impact on an investor's portfolio allocation decision across firms from countries with different legal systems. However, once a fund manager has chosen to invest in a particular firm, the legal environment or shareholder protection laws of the country in which that firm is based should not influence how much of that investment is in the form of that company's ADR versus its underlying domestic security, if both the ADR holder and the holder of the domestic security have similar rights. For example, an investor holding an ADR of a Brazilian firm typically does not have any voting rights. However, the underlying security (typically a preferred share) also lacks these voting rights. In contrast, an investor in a Taiwanese firm has voting rights regardless of whether he holds the ADR or the underlying. While this may make investment in a Taiwanese firm more attractive, there would be no compelling argument as to why an investor would prefer the ADR over the domestic security (or vice versa) in either country if the ADR and the underlying offered exactly the same benefits. In such a case we should expect to see no relationship between a country's legal origins and relative fraction of investment in ADRs of firms from that country.

Two models are estimated. The first includes only the firm-level attributes discussed above and the second includes both firm-level and country-level attributes. We find that, holding all else constant, higher liquidity of a firm's underlying stock is negatively associated with the fraction of investment held in the ADR of that firm. This is consistent with the ease of trading arguments and theoretical models that predict that informed traders would tend to concentrate in the most liquid markets. This finding is strongly supported when we run the regression for the subsample of firms that have listed ADRs. Here we can use a more direct measure of liquidity differences between a firm's ADR and its underlying security by including the Liquidity-Relative variable. 20 The coefficient on this variable is positive and significant at the one percent level across all specifications. These findings provide robust evidence that fund manager's choice of security is significantly affected by the relative liquidity of the two securities. Thus, the mere act of listing an ADR need not move the trading volume from 19 Mitton (2002) finds that higher firm-level disclosure quality had a strong impact on firm performance during the East Asian financial crisis. Related studies also find that firms with ADRs appear in better information environments that are then associated with higher market valuations and significantly larger market reactions to earnings announcements (for example see, Foerster and Karolyi, 1999 , Lang, Lins and Miller, 2003 , and Bailey, Karolyi, and Salva, 2002 , Doidge et al., 2004 . See Karolyi (1998) for an excellent review of the ADR literature. 20 We also used an alternative proxy for relative liquidity denoted by ADR Fraction which is the fraction of the underlying security that is in form of ADR.

The shareholders who bought the shares on NASDAQ were able to sue under American law but shareholders who bought in Toronto stock exchange could only sue under Canadian law.",

For illustration let us assume that there are k funds that have hold an investment in firm i. To estimate the relative weighting of investments in ADR versus the domestic security for this firm we follow a two step process. In the first step, for each fund k we calculate the total dollar amount of investment in firm i, that a fund holds. We then calculate the fraction of that investment in the ADR and the fraction in the underlying for that fund. Next, we take the difference between the fractions of investment in the ADR versus the underlying stock; this difference reflects the relative over or underweighting in ADR for that fund. We repeat this process for all the k funds, thus generating the relative over or under allocation of investment in ADRs for each fund. In the second step, we take a simple average of these k values to get the aggregate measure of over/underweighting across all funds that invest in the firm i and denote it by (ADR Differential) i . (Source:For a particular issuer i, the ADR_RATIO is also calculated in two steps. First, the total value (U.S. dollar amount) of investment by all funds in that firm is calculated. This calculation includes all securities issued by issuer i (for most issuers it is the ADR and the domestic security of that issuer). The second step involves calculating the total investment by all funds in the ADR security of firm i. ADR_RATIO is calculated by taking the ratio of investment in ADR security of firm i by all funds to the investment in all securities of firm i by all funds. (Source: Morningstar) We create an index of firm-level accounting quality (Accounting Quality) which equals the sum of the four separate accounting quality variables: Use of an international big-5 accounting firm, consolidation of financial reports, receipt of a clean audit opinion, and reconciliation with either U.S. GAAP or International Accounting Standards.

In the case of Argentina and Brazil, firms with ADRs make up more than 50 percent of the country's market capitalization. For most Asian countries the proportion of firms with listed ADRs is small and varies between one to three percent. Even though the fraction of Asian firms that have an ADR program is small, these few firms account for a fairly large proportion of total market capitalization. For example, the fraction of market capitalization of ADR firms is 42",

Latin American funds have a far greater fraction of their investment in ADR securities compared to Asian funds. Latin American funds invest more than 45 percent of their assets in ADRs and the remaining 55 percent in domestic stocks. However, Asian funds invest less than 13 percent of their assets in ADRs with the remaining 87 percent being invested in the domestic security. The large variations in ADR investments are also seen at the country-level in Panel B of Table 3. For example, fund investments in Chilean companies are concentrated in ADRs but in the case of Korea the investment is in domestic shares. We next analyze the country and firm attributes that determine whether a fund invests in the ADR or the domestic stock. U.S.-based emerging market mutual funds invest in a total of 1,361 firms: 136 firms have listed ADRs, 251 have unlisted ADRs and 974 firms do not have an ADR as shown in",

        "text": "conclude that well-functioning legal systems that defend the rights of individual investors are important for stock market transactions.LLSV (1998)  find that a country's legal origin is important in explaining the country's laws on creditor rights, shareholder rights, and private property rights and also a country's level of market development. They argue that legal origin matters for financial development because some legal traditions are able to adapt more efficiently to evolving economic conditions. To the extent that legal origin might serve as a proxy for capital market development it would also affect a fund manager's decision to invest in the ADR versus the domestic stock. Therefore, we use more direct measures of market development and transaction costs in addition to legal origin as explanatory variables. Specifically, we estimate the following model: Equation 4 is an expanded version of equation 3. We use direct measures of market development and transaction costs in addition to legal origin as explanatory variables. We include the ratio of market capitalization to GDP (Market Cap/GDP) as a measure of the overall size of the equity market relative to the size of the economy. Liquidity of an exchange is critical for institutional investors and we estimate the average daily turnover (Turnover Country) for the domestic stock exchange and include it as an explanatory variable. We also include a direct measure of transaction costs (Transaction Efficiency). The score on this variable ranges from one to three and is obtained from Wilshire Consulting Group's report forCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System (CALPERS). A higher score implies lower transaction costs and therefore higher efficiency. Transaction costs are associated with trading in a particular market and include items such as stamp taxes and duties, amount of dividends and income taxed, and capital gains taxes. Countries such as Brazil and Mexico have the highest transaction efficiency (lowest costs) with a score of three. The countries with the lowest score on transaction efficiency include Chile, China, Colombia and Indonesia.Similarly, we also include a settlement proficiency variable (Settlement Proficiency) from the same report for CALPERS. This variable captures whether or not a country's trading and settlement is automated and measures the success of the market in settling transactions in a",

        "text": "Panel A reports the results of an OLS regression while Panel B reports the estimates of the Tobit regression. Again the results are broadly similar across the two specifications. In the first model we only include Market Cap/GDP and Turnover Country in addition to GDP per Capita. The model is estimated for all ADRs and for only listed ADRs. The coefficient on Market Cap/GDP is significant and negative for the entire sample and for the sub sample of listed firms it is negative but not significant. The results suggest that fund mangers allocate a relatively smaller proportion of their investment in particular firm's ADR security if that firm's domestic market is well developed (as measured by Market Cap/GDP). The coefficient on Turnover Country is negative and significant in both models. Thus if a firm is based in a country with domestic markets that are deep and liquid, the fund holdings of ADRs of such a firm is relatively low. This provides empirical evidence support for market microstructure models of multiple exchanges(Chowdhary and Nanda (1991)) that predict that informed traders (assuming the active mutual fund investors of our sample can be considered informed traders) choose to trade in markets that have the highest liquidity.16  These results suggest that countries with high turnover appear to retain the order flow of their ADR issuers in the home market. Conversely, the results imply that professional investors are more likely to invest in the ADR relative to the domestic stock if the issuer's home country's stock market is not well developed and has low liquidity.Earlier we discussed the results of previous studies that have documented the association between market development and legal origin. It is possible that our earlier results, showing significant association between a country's legal origin and fund managers' ADR vs. domestic security allocation decision were likely being driven by market development as the legal origin dummy variable was capturing the effect of how developed the country's stock market is. To test this alternative explanation, in the second set of models inTable 6, we include market development variables (Market Cap/GDP and Turnover Country), FX Volatility, and Legal Origin dummies. We also include Settlement Proficiency",
