(2007) documented that in 2000 only about 4 percent of the 5.5 million firms operating in the United States were exporters. Among manufacturing and agricultural firms, only about 15 percent were exporters. Information provided by Eaton, Kortum and Kramarcz (2011) suggests that only about 15 percent of French manufacturing firms with more than 20 employees were exporters in 1986. Although firm census data are scarce, especially in developing countries, it is safe to speculate that exporting is rare among firms. That is, while all countries export, the vast majority of firms do not.",

Those that survive as exporters for more than a year grow rapidly and account for about half of the country's total merchandise export growth after a decade. Lederman et al. (2011) report that the 1999 cohort of entrants into exporting accounted for almost 40 percent of Costa Rica's total merchandise exports by 2005.

Our variable of interest is whether the firm used the services of an EPA between 2006 and 2010.

In all 2010 surveys, firms were asked whether they had used export promotion services over the last 3 years. Thus, by comparing the status of firms in 2006 and 2010, we can measure the impact of having used export promotion services on firms' export entry, exit, survival and intensity. percent of firms that did not use export promotion services in 2006 were exporters, whereas among those firms that used export promotion services 80 percent were exporters. And not only the share of exporters is higher among firms using export promotion services, but the increase in the share of exporters is larger for the sample of firms that used export promotion services, as indicated by the differences-in-differences test in the last column of Table 1 . Indeed, in all countries, with the exception of Colombia, the increase in the share of exporters is statistically larger for firms using export promotion services. Thus, the use of export promotion services seems to be correlated with firm entry into export activities or with a higher survival rate, since the share of exporters in the samples of firms that did not use EPA services declined between 2006 and 2010 in all countries, except Colombia. Table 2 provides a similar exercise, but instead of focusing on the share of exporting firms as in Table 1 , it focuses on the share of direct and indirect exports in firms' total sales. In all countries, export-intensity is higher among firms that used export-promotion services. Moreover, in five of the seven countries, the average export intensity of firms increased significantly more among firms that used export promotion services, as indicated by the differences-in-differences t-statistic in the last column.

Enterprise Ireland's budget promotion is two orders of magnitude higher than the average for LAC EPAs. We know from that there are diminishing returns to EPA expenditure. Ireland may lie on a portion of the curve so flat that no level of government support can increase the probability that a firm will export. However, diminishing returns do not explain why our results on the intensive margin of Latin American exporting firms were weaker than the results from Ireland. That is, conditional on being an exporter in 2006, Latin American firms that received export promotion services also appear to have increased their shares of exports over total sales, although this partial correlation was not statistically significant in all model specifications.",

        "text": "Concluding Remarks There is a growing literature on the impact of export promotion services and subsidies. The latter have generally found that export promotion tends to increase the exports of existing products to existing markets, rather than the \"extensive\" margin of exports. However, this literature has tended to rely on data on exporting firms or product-level trade flow data. There are a couple of exemptions, such as Bernard and Jensen (2004) and Gorg, Henry and Strobl (2008) , but these studies focused on developed countries (the U.S. and Ireland, respectively). Still, these studies found that export promotion is associated with the intensive margin, rather than with the extensive margin. This result could be potentially worrying, as the economic justification often given for the existence of government intervention through export promotion programs often relies on information asymmetries and externalities that should affect the fixed cost of exporting and not the variable costs. Thus, if export promotion programs are correcting these market failures, one should observe an impact of these programs on firms' decision to start exporting or surviving in export markets, rather than on their export levels. In other words, export growth should come through the firms' extensive rather than the intensive margin. The fact that early studies suggest that the programs tend to encourage exports through the intensive margin could raise questions regarding the social desirability of these programs.",

The last column gives the t-statistic on the difference between treated and non-treated firms in the change in the share of exporting firms from 2006-2010. A positive sign on the differences-in-differences t-statistic indicates that the change in the share of exporting firms from 2006-2010 was greater amongst treated firms (i.e. users of EPA services) than amongst non-treated firms (i.e. non-users of EPA services).

The sample in (5) is composed only of firms that exported in 2006. Nonexporter is the category for firms that did not export in 2006 or 2010, survival is the category for firms that exported in both 2006 and 2010, and entry is the category for firms that did not export in 2010 but not in 2006. MLogit coefficients are estimated relative to the base category of old exporter, which is for firms that exported in 2006 but not in 2010. \u0394exp_int is the change in the firm's total exports as a fraction of total sales between 2006 and 2010, treatment is a dummy for whether the firm used EPA services over the previous 3 years, \u0394size is the change in the log of the firm's full-time employment between 2006 and 2010, fdi is the change in foreign ownership of the firm as a share of total ownership between 2006 and 2010, web00 is a dummy for whether the firm did not have a website in either 2006 or 2010, web11 is a dummy for whether the firm had a website in both 2006 and 2010, and web01 is a dummy for whether the firm had a website in 2010 but not in 2006. Email00, email11, and email01 are similarly defined. RRR is the relative risk ratio of treatment, i.e. the probability of ending up in nonexporter, exporter, or new_exporter relative to the probability of ending up in old_exporter for treated vs. nontreated firms. Hence if RRR>1 for a given category, firms are more likely to be in that category relative to being in the base category if treated than if not treated.

Size is the log of the firm's full-time employment, FDI is foreign ownership of the firm as a share of total ownership, Web is a dummy for whether the firm has a website, and Email is a dummy for whether the firm communicates with clients via email. Exit is a dummy for whether the firm exported in 2006 but not in 2010, Nonexporter is a dummy for whether the firm did not export in either 2006 or 2010, Survival is a dummy for whether the firm exported in both 2006 and 2010, Entry is a dummy for whether the firm exported in 2010 but not in 2006, and \u0394exp_int is the change in the firm's total exports as a fraction of total sales between 2006 and 2010. Separation of firms into treatment and control groups was done using three different matching methods: kernel, stratification (with four blocks), and nearest neighbor. Average treatment effect reported as difference in means between treatment and control groups. The last row in each table corresponds to estimations with the sub-sample of firms that were exporters in 2006.
