We capture these reforms, albeit crudely in the model, thinking of them as domestic reforms that allow deposit mobilization and access to credit at market clearing interest rates for a segment of the population that otherwise would have neither formal sector savings nor credit.",

        "text": "We take this methodology to Thailand from 1976 to 19962. Thailand is a good country to study for a number of reasons. First, Thailand is often portrayed as an example of an emerging market, with high income growth and increasing inequality. The GDP growth from 1981-1995 was 8 percent per year, and the Gini measure of inequality increased from .42 in 1976 to .50 in 1996. Second, Jeong (1999) documents in his study of the sources of growth in Thailand,1976 Thailand, -1996 , that access to intermediation narrowly defined accounts for 20 percent of the growth in per capita income while occupation shifts alone account for 21 percent. While the fraction of non-farm entrepreneurs does not grow much, the income differential of non-farm entrepreneurs to wage earners is large and thus small shifts in the population create relatively large income changes. In fact, the occupational shift may have been financed by credit. Also related, Jeong finds that 32 percent of changes in inequality between 1976-1996 are due to changes in income differentials across occupations. There is evidence that Thailand had a relatively restrictive credit system but also liberalized during this period. Officially, interest rates ceilings and lending restrictions were progressively removed starting in 19893. The data do seem to suggest a rather substantial increase in the number of households with access to formal intermediaries although this expansion (which we call a liberalization) begins two years earlier, in 1987. Finally, Thailand experienced a relatively large increase in capital inflows from the late 1980's to the mid 1990's.",

        "text": "Our starting point is a relatively simple but general equilibrium model with credit constraints. Specifically, we pick from the literature and extend the Lloyd-Ellis and Bernhard (2000) model (LEB for short) that features wealth-constrained entry into business and wealth-constrained investment for entrepreneurs. For our purposes, this model has several advantages. It allows for ex ante variation in ability. It allows 1 See for example Gallup, Radelet and Warner (1998) and Dollar and Kraay (2002) for evidence that growth helps reduce poverty and the concerns of Ravallion (2001 Ravallion ( , 2002 about their approach. 2 We focus on this 20 year transition period, not on the financial crisis of 1997. Our own view is that we need to understand the growth that preceded the crisis before we can analyze the crisis itself. 30kuda and Mieno (1999) recount from one perspective the history of financial liberalization in Thailand, that is, with an emphasize on interest rates, foreign exchange liberalization, and scope of operations. They argue that in general there was deregulation and an increase in overal competition, especially from the standpoint of commercial banks. It seems that commercial bank time deposit rates were partially deregulated by June 1989 and on-lending rates by 1993, hence with a lag. They also provide evidence that suggests that the spread between commercial bank deposit rates and on-lending prime rates narrowed from 1986-1990, though it increased somewhat thereafter, to June 1995. Likewise there was apparently greater competition from finance companies, and the gap between deposit and share rates narrowed across these two types of institutions, as did on-lending rates. Thai domestic rates in general approached from above international, LIBOR rates. Most of the regulations concerning scope of operations, including new licenses, the holdmg of equity, and the opening of off-shore international bank facihties are dated March 1992 at the earliest. See also Klinhowhan (1999) for further details.",

Finally, it features a dual economy development model which has antecedents going back to Lewis (1954) and Fei and Ranis (1964) , and thus it captures several widely observed aspects of the development process: industrialization with persistent income differentials, a slow decline in the subsistence sector, and an eventual increase in wages, all contributing to growth with changing inequality.",

The intermediated sector is allowed to expand exogenously at the observed rate in the Thai data, given initial participation and the initial observed distribution of wealth. Of course in other contexts and for many questions one would like financial deepening to be endogenous 4 . But here the exogeneity of financial deepening has a peculiar, distinct advantage because we can vary it as we like, either to mimic the Thai data with its accelerated upturns in the late 80's and early 90's, or keep it flat providing a counterfactual experiment. We can thus gauge the consequences of these various experiments and compare among them. In short, we can do general equilibrium policy analysis following the seminal work of Lochner, Heckman and Taber (1998) , despite endogenous prices and an evolving endogenous distribution of wealth in a model where preferences do not aggregate",

Key parameters of the production technology used by firms and the distribution of entrepreneurial talent in the population are chosen to maximize the likelihood as predicted by the model of the transition into business given initial wealth. This is done with two distinct microeconomic datasets, one a series of nationally representative household surveys (SES), and the other gathered under a project directed by one of the authors, with more reliable estimates of wealth, the timing of occupation transitions, and the use of formal and informal credit. Not all parameters of the model can be estimated via maximum likelihood. The savings rate, the differential in the cost of living, and the exogenous technical progress in the subsistence sector are calibrated to try to match the two decades of Thai growth and observed changes in inequality, labor share, savings and the number of entrepreneurs.",

The distribution of welfare gains and losses in these experiments is not at all uniform, as there are various effects depending on wealth and talent: with liberalization, savings earn interest, although this tends to benefit the wealthy most. On the other hand, credit is available to facilitate occupation shifts and to finance setup costs and investment. Quantitatively, there is a striking conclusion. The primary winners from financial liberalization are talented but low wealth would-be entrepreneurs who without credit cannot go into business at all or entrepreneurs with very little capital Mean gains from the winners range from 60,000 to 80,000 baht, and the modal gains from 6,000 to 25,000 baht, depending on the dataset used and the calendar year. To normalize and give more meaning to these numbers, the modal gains ranges from 17 to 34 percent of the observed, overall average of Thai household income.",

These contribute to increasing growth, increasing inequality, and an increasing number of entrepreneurs, but only slightly, since otherwise the macro and distributional consequences are quite similar to those of the closed economy with liberalization. Indeed, if we change the expansion to grow linearly rather than as observed in the data, the model cannot replicate the high Thai growth rates in the late 80's and early 90's, despite apparently large capital inflows at that time. Second, we allow informal credit in the sector without formal intermediation to see if our characterization of the dual economy with its no-credit sector is too extreme. We find that at the estimated parameters it is not. Changes attributed to access to informal credit are negligible.",

We do suppose this set up cost varies inversely with talent, that is, it takes both talent and an initial investment to start a business but they are negatively correlated More generally, the cumulative distribution H(x, m) is a crude way to capture and allow estimation of the distribution of talent in the population and is not an unusual specification in the industrial organization literature 7 , e.g, Das et al. (1998) , Veracierto (1998) . Cost x is expressed in the same units as wealth. Every agent is born with an inheritance or initial wealth b. The distribution of inheritances in the population at date t is given by Gt(b): Bt -a [0,1] where B t c R. 4 + is the changing support of the distribution at date t. The time argument t makes explicit the evolution of Bt and Ct over time. The beginning-of-period wealth b and the cost x are the only sources of heterogeneity among the population These are modelled as independent of one another in the specification used here, and this gives us the existence of a unique steady state. If correlation between wealth and ability were allowed, we could have poverty traps, as in Banerjee and Newman (1993) . We do recognize that in practice wealth and ability may be correlated. In related work, Paulson and Townsend (2001) estimate with the same data as here a version of the Evans and Jovanovic (1989) model allowing the mean of unobserved ability to be a linear function of wealth and education They find the magnitude of both coefficients to be small 8 .",

In any event, the overall utility maximization problem is converted into a simple end-of-period wealth maximization problem. If we do not wish to take this short-lived generational overlap too seriously, we can interpret the model as having an exogenously imposed myopic savings rate w which below we calibrate against the data. We can then focus our attention on the nontrivial endogenous evolution of the wealth distribution. The key to both static and dynamic features of the model is a partition of the equilibrium occupation choice in (b, x) space into three regions: unconstrained firms, constrained firms, and workers or subsisters. These regions are determined by the equilibrium wage w. One can represent these regions as (b, x) combinations yielding the occupation choices of agents of the model, using the exogenous distribution of costs H(x, m) at each period along with the endogenous and evolving distribution Gt(b) of wealth b. The population of the economy is normalized so that the fractions of constrained firms, unconstrained firms, workers, and subsisters add to unity.

In addition, since xU(b, w) is the curve separating constrained and unconstrained entrepreneurs, xu(b, w) = x for b > b* also and thus the two curves coincide. Again, see Figure 1 in page 39. Notice that for b > b-and x < z-, a firm is fully capitalized at the (implicit) rate of return in the backyard storage technology. In this sense they are neoclassical unconstrained firms 9For certain combinations of a,t and p, labor demand could actually be negative. Lloyd-Ellis and Bernhard did not consider these possibilities by assuming that t > w, and a > 0, p > 0. However, one could envision situations where C < w and a > 0 in which case, for low values of capital k it may not pay to use labor. Still at the same parameters, if the capital employed were large, then the expression in (7) may be positive. The intuition is that although labor is rather unproductive, it is complementary to capital. In this paper, however, we follow Lloyd-Ellis and Bernhard and assume that such cases of negative labor do not arise. Therefore, capital and labor demands will always be nonnegative. Now we proceed to define the occupational choice and constrained/unconstrained cutoffs for b < be. We begin by noting that for b < be, the agent will always be constrained as a firm at the point of occupational indifference xe(b, w) between the choice of becoming a worker or an entrepreneur' 0 . This fact implies that we can use the constrained capital input kC = bx to determine xe(b, w) with the additional restriction that xe(b, w) S b, because the entrepreneur must have enough wealth to afford at least the setup cost.",

Specifically, the decision problem of every household at every date depends only on the individual beginning-of-period wealth b and cost x and on the economy-wide wage w. Further, if the initial wealth b and the wage w are observable, while x is not, then the likelihood that an individual will be an entrepreneur can be determined entirely as in the occupation partition diagram, from the curve z'(b, w) and the exogenous distribution of talent H(x, m). That is, the probability that an individual household with initial wealth b will be an entrepreneur is given by H(ze(b, w), m), the likelihood that cost x is less than or equal to xz(b, w). The residual probability 1 -H(xe(b, w), m) dictates the likelihood that the individual household will be a wage earner. The fixed cost z takes on values in the unit interval and yet enters additively into the entrepreneur's problem defined at wealth b. Thus setup costs can be large or small relative to wealth depending on how we convert from 1997 Thai baht into LEB units 14 . We therefore search over different scaling factors s in order to map wealth data into the model units. Related, we pin down the subsistence level -y in the model by using the estimated scale s to convert to LEB model units the counterpart of subsistence measured in Thai baht in the data, corresponding to the earnings of those in subsistence agriculture. 1 4 The relative magnitude of the fixed costs will drop as wealth evolves over time. Now let a denote the vector of parameters of the model related to the production function and scaling factor, that is, a = (f, a,p,a, ,s). Suppose we had a sample of n households, and let y, be a zeroone indicator variable for the observed entrepreneurship choice of household i. Then with the notation x'(b, 1, w) for the point on the xe(b, w) curve for household i with wealth b,, at parameter vector 0 with wage w, we can write the explicit log likelihood of the entrepreneurship choice for the n households as 1n Ln(9,m) = -EylnH [xe(btIO, ",

Within each province, 48 villages were selected in a stratified clustered random sample. Thus the sample excludes urban households. Within each village 15 households were selected at random. The advantage of this survey is that the household questionnaire elicits an enumeration of all potential assets (household, agricultural and business), finds out what is currently owned, and if so when it was acquired. In this way, as in Paulson and Townsend (2001) , we create an estimate of past wealth, specifically wealth of the household 6 years prior to the 1997 interview, 1991. The survey also asks about current and previous occupations of the head, and in this way it creates estimates of occupation transitions, that is which of the households were not operating their own business before 1992, five years prior to the 1997 interview, and started a business in the following five years. Approximately 21 percent of the households made this transition in the last five years and 7 percent between five and ten years ago. A business owner in the Townsend-Thai data is a store owner, shrimp farmer, trader or mechanic 2 0 . Among other variables, the survey also records the current education level of household members; the history of use of the various possible financial institutions: formal (commercial banks, BAAC and village funds) and informal (friends and relatives, landowners, shopkeepers and moneylenders); and whether households claimed to be currently constrained in the operation of their business. 21 ' 22 Since the LEB model is designed to explain the behavior of those agents without access to credit, we restrict our sample to those households that reported having no relationship with any formal or informal credit institution, another strength of the survey 2 3 . A disadvantage of the second dataset is that as a single cross section, there is no temporal variation in wages. Thus, we identify the production parameters by dividing the observations into two subsamples containing the households in the northeast 18See Jeong (1999) and Jeong and Townsend (2000) for details. 1 9 Robert M. Townsend is the principal investigator for this survey. See Townsend et al. (1997). 2 0 Reassuringly, Table 1C in Paulson and Townsend (2001) shows that the initial investment necessary to open a business is the roughly same in both regions among the most common types of businesses 2 1 The percentage of households m non-farm businesses is 13 percent and 28 percent in the central vs northeast regions.",

The final sample consists of a total of 1272 households with 707 households from the northeast region and 565 households from the central region. Figure 2 in page 39 displays the occupational map generated using the estimated parameters. For the SES dataset, observations in 1981 seem to be less constrained than those in 1976, naturally as the country was growing and wealth was higher. For the Townsend-Thai dataset, the central region appears to be less credit constrained than the Northeast, reflecting perhaps the fact that the central region is more prosperous. Table 1 reports the estimated parameters as well as the standard errors 25 . The parameter y for both datasets was found by multiplying an estimate of the subsistence level from the data by the scaling factor estimated. For the SES data, we used the mean income of farmers in 1976 which amounted to 19,274 baht. Analogously, we used the average income of workers in the Northeast region without access to credit as reported in the Townsend-Thai data, or 10,727 baht. The wage for the two time periods in the model units at the estimated scaling factor s were W 7 6 = 0.048 and w8l = 0.053 for the SES dataset and WNE = 0 016 and wc = 0.037 for the two regions in the Townsend-Thai dataset. The maximized value of the likelihood function obtained using the SES data was -8,233.92 whereas the Townsend-Thai dataset yielded a value of -616.92. The parameter value and standard error reported are multiplied by a factor of 106. 24 Unfortunately, estimating a model that, features a unique wage by exploiting the geographical variation m the wage observed in the data is a contradiction. Of course costly migration could be introduced but we do not take that explicit approach here. We draw some confidence from the fact that these are secondary data and we are comparing its estimates to those from the SES dataset, with its temporal variation in wages consistent with the estimated model.",

During this same period, the Thai economy GDP growth rate was the highest in the world at 10.3 percent. These high growth periods have attracted much attention. Labor share is relatively stable at 0.40 and rising after 1990, to 0.45 by 1995. A trend from the 1990-1995 data was used to extrapolate labor share for 1996. Savings as a percent of national income were roughly 22 percent from the initial period to 1985. Savings then increased after 1986 to 33 percent, in the higher growth period. These numbers, though typical of Asia, are relatively high. The fraction of entrepreneurs is remarkably steady, though slightly increasing, from 14 percent to 18 percent. The Gini coefficient stood at 0.42 in the 1976 SES survey and increased more or less steadily to 0.53 in 1992. Inequality decreased slightly in both the 1994 and 1996 rounds, to 0.50. This downward trend mirrors the rise in the labor share during the same period, and both may be explained by the increase in the wage rate. This level of inequality is relatively high, especially for Asia, and rivals many countries in Latin America (though dominated as usual by Brazil).

The simulated labor share is able to roughly match the trend displayed in the data, although it is always higher in levels.

Labor share increases sharply in the model, but not in the data. The income Gini coefficient and the fraction of entrepreneurs are very poorly matched as both drop to zero. The reason for such drastic macroeconomic aggregates is the choice of model parameters which try to match the growth rate of income. The subsistence sector is so profitable relative to setting up a business that by 1988 all entrepreneurial activity disappears and everyone in the subsistence sector earns the same amount.

Now the model is able to generate simulated time series which track the Thai economy more accurately. In the model, the growth rate of income is again lower than that of the Thai economy. The model still starts with negative growth until 1984. The initial phase of negative growth comes from an initial overly high aggregate wealth in the economy. But growth jumps to 5.4 percent by 1987. This high growth phase comes from the rapid expansion of credit during those years. Finally, the growth rate declines after 1987 monotonically, driven by the imposed diminishing returns in the production function. The model matches remarkably well the labor share levels and changes, especially after 1990 where they both show a steady rise. The savings rate is only closely matched for the period 1987-1996. The model also predicts a slightly decreasing fraction of entrepreneurs until 1985 and then a steady increase from 8.7 percent in 1985 to 16 1 percent in 1995, resembling more the actual levels. Finally, the Gini coefficient folows a slightly decreasing, then slightly increasing, and finally sharply decreasing trend, starting at .481 in 1976, then .377 by 1985, increasing to .451 by 1991 and declining again to .284 by 1996. Beneath these macro aggregates lie the model's underpinnings. Growth after 1985 is driven by a steady decline out of the subsistence sector, with income from earned wages and from profits steadily increasing to 1990. Profits per entrepreneur are particularly high. Then, with the subsistence sector depleted entirely, the wage increases faster, and profits begin to decrease. Thus labor share picks up and inequality falls.",

If such was the case, then demand for workers would drive up wages, increasing the labor share and reducing inequality.

And of course there is a similar price impact for those in the intermediated sector, but there is a credit effect there as well. There are such wage effects using the parameters estimated from both datasets after 1990. Implicit in this discussion is another problem which has no obvious remedy here, given the model. Although households in the model maximize end-of-period wealth, they pass on a fraction of that wealth to their heirs. Thus the end-of-period wealth effects of the liberalization are passed onto subsequent generations. The problem is that there is no obvious summary devicehouseholds do not maximize discounted expected utility, as in Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) and the analysis of Townsend and Ueda (2001) , for example.

As noted earlier, the wage has not yet increased as a result of the liberalization. Its value is .0198 in the liberalized and restricted benchmark economies. The interest rate in the intermediated sector of the liberalized economy is very high, at 93 percent. This reflects the high marginal product of capital in an economy with a relatively low distribution of wealth. Figure 7b in page 44 displays the corresponding occupation partition, but now denoting for given beginning-of-period (b, x) combinations the corresponding occupation of a household in the no-credit economy and in the credit sector of the intermediated economy. The darker shades of Figure 7b denote households with (b, x) combinations who do not change their occupation as a result of the liberalization, that is, they are entrepreneurs (E) in the no-credit (NC) economy and in the intermediated sector of the liberalized (C) economy, or workers (W) in both instances. The light shades denote households who switch: low wealth but low cost agents who were workers become entrepreneurs, and high wealth, high cost agents who were entrepreneurs become workers. The picture is the overlap of the occupational maps in both sectors. For the credit sector, the key parameter is z, whereas for the no-credit sector, it is the curve xe(b, wo). Figure 7a in page 44 displays the corresponding end-of-period wealth percentage changes in the same (b, x) space. Since the wage is the same in both sectors, agents will only benefit from being in the credit sector, not only because they can freely borrow at the prevailing rate if they decide to become entrepreneurs, but because they can deposit their wealth and earn interest on it. The wealth gain due to interest rate earnings can be best seen by fixing x and moving along the b axis, noting the rise.",

Recall that in the intermediated sector, only the most talented individuals will start a firm, irrespective of their wealth. However, even when we relax the constraint in the no-credit sector by alowing informal finance, wealth still matters in determining who becomes an entrepreneur, and thus the tent-shaped welfare gains still appear. In addition, the increased wage in the latter periods does benefit workers in the liberalized economy. In the no-credit economy which now has informal credit, some households become richer but the additional capital from informal sources is insufficient to trigger an increase in the equilibrium wage rate.

This would slow down the growth of financial infrastructure and would rationalize some of the limited participation that we see but there would be no Pareto-improving policy intervention. However, Townsend and Ueda (2001) in an extended version of the Greenwood and Jovanovic model draw the conclusion that restrictive financial sector policies may have nevertheless slowed down entry into the financial sector below the endogenous rate. Thus financial sector liberalization, allowing intermediation at its otherwise endogenous value, is also associated with welfare gains, as in this paper Although occupation choice models should allow more endogenous financial sector participation, they illustrate well as they stand the fact that there may be welfare losses for some sectors of the population, not just gains, to liberalization. This offers a political economy rational for the apparently restrictive policies that we observed in Thailand.",

In the model here fixed setup costs are allowed to vary across potential entrepreneurs, as if drawn from a quadratic cumulative distribution, but the quadratic production function mapping labor and capital into output is uniform across potential entrepreneurs. This delivers the occupation partition diagram and variation over time in the size distribution of firms, a function of the wage and the endogenous distribution of wealth. Indeed, an industrial organization literature starting with Lucas (1978) begins the same way, at least in spirit. He postulates an underlying distribution of personal managerial talent and then studies the division of persons into managers and employees and the allocation of productive inputs across managers. This has implications for secular changes in average firm size. This point is revisited by Gollin (1999) .",

        "text": "Here the distribution of size and profits among firms is driven by self-financing, an endogenous and evolving distribution of wealth, and differential access to credit. That is, high set up costs and limited credit can limit the use of real physical capital in the standard part of the production function or can impede entry entirely. Likewise, some portion of end-of period profits is passed on to subsequent time periods if not subsequent generations. This could be an explanation for some of the serial correlation in size, profits, and employment that is seen in actual data, even when shocks in the form of set up costs are independent and identically distributed over time and households There would be implications for the cross-sectional dispersion in growth rates. Indeed, it seems that in Thailand larger firms, and those with financial access, may have grown faster than smaller ones as the credit market expanded in the late 1980's. Recent theoretical work is beginning to readdress earlier the supposed facts of firm growth and survival in the context of endogenous limited financial contracts. See Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2001) and Cooley, Marimon and Quadrini (2000) More generally both the industrial organization and credit market literature need to be brought together. Existing empirical work has documented relationships between investment and the balance sheet, for example, but much of this work is somewhat atheoretic, documenting that the world is not neoclassical but leaving us wondering what the impediments to trade really are. The general equilibrium models of Banerjee and Newman (1993) , Piketty (1997) and Aghion and Bolton (1997) take different stands on those underpinnings but collectively make the point that growth and inequality can be related to imperfect credit markets. That of course was our starting point here.",

Observed relationships of entrepreneurship, investment, and access to credit as functions of wealth and talent suggest that the ABL model fits the micro Thai data best, but the EJ model fits well for those with relatively low levels of wealth and those in the Northeast, while LEB, the model here, is a close contender. This suggests that a calculation of the welfare gains and losses to financial intermediation based on these other models would be worthwhile, though the average and modal estimates here should not be rejected out of hand. It does seem plausible, however, that the dramatic gains near the wealth equal set-up costs or 45\u00b0 line would be vulnerable to alternative specifications.",

        "text": "The growth and inequality literature relying on each of these underpinnings presupposes, as in the LEB model here, either an overlapping generations model with a bequest motive or a simplistic, myopic solution to the household savings problem. More needs to be done to make the models dynamic. Coupling households with firms and modelling the firms' inter-temporal decision problems will require more work, but again, given the prelinminary results here, that work would appear to be warranted. Data on the growth rate of GDP is taken from the computations of Tinakorn and Sussangkarn (1998) of the TDRI (Thailand Development Research Institute). They use data from the the NESDB (National Economic Social Development Board) in Thailand. Data for the missing years 1976-1980 were taken directly from the NESDB \"Gross Regional Product and Gross Provincial Product\" national income accounts and for 1996 as reported by the Bank of Thailand. The real GDP growth series in Table 2 is constructed by subtracting a 3-year moving average of the reported TFP growth in Tinakorn and Sussangkarn (1998) from the observed GDP growth rate. TFP growth was extrapolated for the missing years. We subtract TFP growth because we are only interested in growth due to factor accumulation, as the model allows no technological progress 42 . The data on labor share come also from the calculations of Tinakorn and Sussangkarn (1998) . The savings rate can also be estimated from national income accounts. Here we use the numbers provided by the Bank of Thailand from 1980-1996 and extrapolated the missing years. Data on the number of entrepreneurs as a fraction of the Thai population come from successive rounds of the national level income and expenditures socio-economic survey, the SES mentioned earlier, administered by the National Statistics Office. Here we use the occupation of the head of the household unit. There are four broad categories for occupation: wage worker, farmer, nonfarm entrepreneur, and inactive. We define entrepreneur as the head of household listed as non-farm entrepreneur. We approximate the missing years using cubic spline interpolation. The same SES surveys were used to compute the widely used Gini index as a measure of inequality. Finally we again use the SES data and the calculations of Jeong (1999) to determine the fraction of the population which has access to intermediated, credit and savings markets, i.e., that reside in the credit sector 43 .",

This determines the occupational choice for the agents with wealth b: the mass of people for whom the setup cost x satisfies x < x'(b, w) wiU become entrepreneurs. Given that the total population has mass one, individual probabilities coincide with the fraction of agents in the population. Therefore, the total number of agents with wealth b that will become entrepreneurs is the fraction (probability) of agents with initial wealth b multiplied by the probability of the event x < X'(b, w). Aggregating over the entire support Bt we obtain the total number of entrepreneurs E(w) as a function of the wage w.

Notice that labor demand consists of two parts: demand by unconstrained firms, which solely depends on the wage w, and demand by constrained firms which depends on both the capital employed bx and the wage w. More formally, 201 z(b6,)Ld(w) = E tI(w)H(xu(b., w)) +where g is the discretized probability function of the wealth distribution (cdf) G. Intuitively, if at the given wage w, Ld(w) + E(w) is greater than one, then the wage is too low and needs to be higher. That is, labor demand is proportional to number of entrepreneurs E, and it is easy to show that both E(w) and Ld(w) are monotonically decreasing in wages. If E(w) + Ld(w) is less than one, the guessed wage is too high and so it should be lower, except if w = w. Indeed, if we reach the lower bound w, it means that at this minimum wage, total labor demand in the urban sector (entrepreneurs and workers) is less than the total population and therefore some agents will become subsisters More formally, the algorithm uses a bisection method to determine the wage rate w . The use of this simple method is warranted by the fact that both E(W) and Ld(w) are monotonically decreasing in the wage w and thus a unique equilbrium exists. It starts with WL = w and some arbitrary 4 7 upper bound WH = W-It then computes E(WL) + Ld (WL) with the wage at the lower bound, WL = w. This is the obvious initial guess. Then if E(WL) + Ld(WL) < 1, labor market clearing is achieved If on the contrary E(WL) + Ld(WL) > 1, there is an excess demand at the prevailing wage WL and the wage needs to be raised. From here onwards the algorithm proceeds as follows:1. Update the wage to w' = w+WH and compute E(w') + Ld(WI).(a) If E(W,') + Ld(tI) < 1, update the upper bound WH =W' and repeat to Step 1. If no guess appears to ever clear the market, we have nevertheless a sequence of upper and lower bounds with the equilibrium wage trapped in an interval whose width is converging. So, if WH -WL < , where e is a convergence criterion, then the program sets W = WL.",

The upper bound BH is defined as the bequest of the agent with the highest initial wealth b, assuming she has the lowest setup coat x. Similarly, the lower bound BL is defined as the bequest of the agent with the lowest initial wealth b assuming she has the highest setup cost x. We take BL and BH as the two endpoints of the support B' and divide the interval into 201 equally spaced grid points. Now with the equilibrium wage determined, the occupation for each agent and her corresponding income and wealth can be computed. We thus can find what her bequest will be. We then proceed by placing this bequest to the closest bequest B' E B' grid point. Next period bequest as a function of the initial wealth b and occupation choice is as follows:, (the agent becomes a subsister or worker), (unconstrained entrepreneur). (C3) The assignment of bequests to the appropriate B-grid points varies according to their occupational choice. For the workers it is relatively simple. All workers with given initial wealth b will bequest the same amount given in equation (C3) above. So we find the B' E B' closest to that bequest B and assign the measure of all workers with initial wealth b to that particular value. More formally,where g'(.) denotes the bequest (and hence next period wealth) distribution. We can then proceed analogously for all initial wealth grid points b E B. The assignment for entrepreneurs is more difficult because the bequest also depends on the setup cost x. A simple straightforward way would be to discretize x and then for each (x, b) pair, compute the corresponding occupational choice, income and bequest and assign it to the closest B'-grid point. But this entails discretizing z. The approach we take does away with discretizing x. The intuition is to go backwards.Consider for example the unconstrained entrepreneurs. We know that for a given ",
