Not surprisingly, the focus of the academic literature on unauthorized migration has been on the impact of irregularity on the host country. However, little is known about the consequences of irregular migration on sending countries. Studying the impact of illegality on the origin country is particularly important since unauthorized migration is often temporary, and many irregular migrants return to their home country either because they are deported or because they planned on temporary migration all along.",

At the same time, irregular migration has been on the rise.

Another example is Mexico, known for being a major migrant sending country to the United States, for its unauthorized emigration, and for its substantial return migration flows. According to the Mexican National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (ENADID), between 2009 and 2014, about half (48%) of the Mexican immigrant population in the United States was unauthorized, and one million Mexicans returned from the United States, leaving of their own accord (Gonzalez-Barrera, 2015). 1 Many other developing countries are likewise experiencing high return migration rates, as well as an increase in unauthorized emigration.",

        "text": "This paper is the first to examine the impact of undocumented migration status on migrants upon return to their home country. It investigates an unexplored question, namely the impact of the legal status of migrants on their wages upon return. We study the impact of return migration on wages by disentangling the effects of overseas legal versus illegal status and ask whether undocumented temporary migration has any impact on human capital accumulation that persists after return. From a conceptual point of view, temporary migrants might acquire human capital and skills due to their work experience abroad and hence earn higher wages upon return compared to non-migrants. However, whether all migrants, documented or undocumented, would benefit from their migration experience upon return is not straightforward. On one hand, if illegal status hinders the human capital accumulation and the skill acquisition of undocumented migrants, the well-evidenced wage premium witnessed by migrants upon return might not apply and we might expect that only documented migrants would benefit from their migration experience. On the other hand, the origin country's labor market might reward the migration experience regardless of the documented or undocumented nature of migration. If the latter scenario applies, through a signaling mechanism, all migrants would benefit from their experience overseas, regardless of the nature of migration and/or of the human capital and skills acquired abroad.",

For instance, Vinogradova (2016) provides theoretical explanations for the optimal timing of return of undocumented migrants, whereby the threat of deportation increases uncertainty with respect to the length of the stay abroad, which in turn reduces the desired migration duration and triggers voluntary return. In line with this theoretical argument, several papers find that a significant share of unauthorized migrants intend to immigrate only temporarily and to eventually return to their home country (Borjas, Freeman, & Lang, 1991) . Reyes (2001) finds that undocumented Mexican immigrants are much more likely to return than documented ones. Coniglio, De Arcangelis, and Serlenga (2009) find that more than 70% of illegal immigrants to Italy planned to return home after an average intended stay of 6 years and that high-skilled clandestine migrants are more likely to return to the origin country compared with those with no or low skills. On the other hand, other studies have found lower return rates among undocumented immigrants due to stricter border enforcement (Kemnitz & Mayr, 2012; Massey, Pren, & Durand, 2016) .",

Using the 1990 Legalized Population Survey, Rivera-Batiz (1999) estimate a 52% wage penalty for Mexican undocumented immigrants in the United States, while Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark (2002) report a wage penalty that ranges between 14% and 24%. Phillips and Massey (1999) find that the Immigration Reform and Control Act in the United States, which made it illegal to hire unauthorized immigrants, is associated with a larger wage penalty for undocumented migrants as employers pass the costs of unauthorized hiring on to workers. Accounting for selection, Schluter and Wahba (2009) also find a significant effect of illegality on wages in the host country but mixed effects on remitting behavior. On the other hand, Dustmann, Fasani, and Speciale (2017) find that undocumented migrants consume about 40% less than documented migrants in Italy, partly due to their lower incomes relative to documented migrants.",

        "text": "The literature has put forward several explanations for the worse outcomes experienced by undocumented migrants compared with documented migrants. First, several studies show that undocumented migrants have weak bargaining power due to the lack of legal work options. Without viable outside options, undocumented migrants are confined into poor jobs (Gleeson & Gonzales, 2012; Gonzales, 2011) . For instance, undocumented migrants are more likely to work in physically exhausting and dangerous jobs and receive no compensating differential, which is analogous to receiving lower wages than documented workers with similar education levels (Hall & Greenman, 2015) . Second, the occupational choices of undocumented migrants might be limited by fear of exposure to apprehension by immigration enforcement agencies, and relatedly, being undocumented may limit workers' ability to maximize their potential, which may lead to lower productivity (Ortega & Hsin, 2018) . Third, several studies highlight the increased risk of depression and anxiety among undocumented migrants-due to the threat of deportation and poorer labor market conditions-which is also likely to negatively affect worker productivity (Abrego, 2011; Gonzales, 2011; Patler & Pirtle, 2018) .",

        "text": "There is also a well-established academic literature on the determinants and impacts of migration on countries of origin. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence showing that temporary migration can be beneficial for migrants who accumulate savings and skills, which they use to better themselves upon return (see Wahba (2014) for a survey of this literature). On the impact of temporary migration experiences on return migrants' wages, several papers find that there is a positive wage premium for return migrants associated with overseas work experience (Co, Gang, & Yun, 2000; De Coulon & Piracha, 2005) . Ambrosini, Mayr, Peri, and Radu (2015) find that for a source country, like Romania, relatively high rates of temporary migration have positive long-run effects on average skills and wages. Lacuesta (2010) finds an 11% wage gap between returning migrants and observationally equivalent non-migrants in Mexico, but argues that this premium is the result of pre-migration differences in ability and not the result of human capital gains derived from migration. Reinhold and Thom (2013) also find a wage premium for Mexican returnees who worked in the United States. The return to a year of occupation-specific migration experience is estimated to be as high as 9% for some occupations. De Vreyer, Gubert, and Robilliard (2010) examine the labor market outcomes of returnees in seven capital cities in West Africa and find that experience abroad results in a substantial wage premium for migrants returning from an OECD country but not for other return migrants. Controlling for the emigration and return migration selections, Wahba (2015) finds that return migrants experience a wage premium of 16% relative to non-migrants. However, none of these studies has examined the differential effects of return migration on wages with respect to migrants' legal status.",

Based on the Development Economics Group data from the World Bank, Brodmann, Pouget, and Gatti (2010) show that, in 2005, Egypt was among the top 10 emigration countries in the world. Second, our data provides unique information on migrants' legal status while abroad, which allows us to distinguish between return migrants according to their type of international migration-documented versus undocumented.

Our benchmark results show an estimated 19% wage penalty for illegal migrants relative to non-migrants, while documented migrants witness a wage premium of 28% relative to non-migrants.

Moreover, our results suggest that undocumented migrants have significantly lower savings overseas, shorter migration duration, lower incidence of remitting, and lower ranked occupations overseas. Overall, these findings suggest that undocumented migrants' lower earnings after return might be explained by a waste of human capital overseas. Indeed, we find evidence suggesting that the longer undocumented migrants stay abroad, the more their human capital is depleted, while the opposite is true for documented migrants. This is fully consistent with our descriptive analysis that shows that poor working conditions constitute the most important reason for return migration among undocumented migrants.",

The largest boost to migration flows occurred after the 1973 War, when oil revenues quadrupled and Gulf countries started implementing major development programs. Ever since Egypt has experienced regular outflows of its workers. To a large extent this was triggered by the labor shortages in the oil-producing Gulf countries and the increased demand for foreign labor. The majority of Egyptian migrants went to neighboring Arab states: to oil exporting Arab countries (the Gulf states, Libya, and Iraq) and to non-oil exporting Arab countries (Jordan and Lebanon) to replace nationals of those countries who migrated to the Gulf. A small proportion of Egyptian migration is permanent in nature and is destined to North America and Australia. More recently, after the 2011 Arab Spring and the economic slowdown that followed, Egyptian migration to Europe has increased (De Bel-Air, 2016).",

In this paper, we focus particularly on the 2012 round (ELMPS 2012). As in a typical labor force survey, the ELMPS covers topics such as employment, unemployment, job dynamics, and earnings but also provides very rich information on education, migration, and socio-economic characteristics. In 2012, the ELMPS interviewed 12,060 households, which yields to a total sample size of 49,186 individuals. The ELMPS 2012 includes a refresher sample of 2,000 households that was selected from an additional 200 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) randomly selected from a new master sample prepared by CAPMAS. By design, it over-sampled areas with high migration rates, and is nationally representative once weights are applied (Assaad & Krafft, 2013) . 6 We rely on the return migration module that surveys all individuals aged between 15 and 59 years old. In 2012, about 10% of the households had a returnee. In the ELMPS, a returnee is defined as an individual who has worked abroad for more than six months, but was back in Egypt at the time of the survey. This module features return migrants' characteristics, incidences of migration, reasons for migration, financial situation before migration, year and country of first migration episode, year of final return, earnings and savings abroad, remittances, as well as documents obtained to travel and work abroad. In addition, the ELMPS 2012 collects rich retrospective information on previous employment characteristics and their location. At the same time, households are asked about current members of the household who were overseas at the time of the survey, and collects information on their overseas destination, overseas employment, migration duration, and frequency of contact/visits to the household back home.",

In addition, documented migrants are found to have longer migration spells relative to undocumented migrants, by one year on average. However, there is no significant difference in terms of number of migration episodes between the two groups-as they both seem on average to have one migration spell.

By contrast, in the 1990s and in the 2000s, a higher proportion of documented migrants migrated for the first time compared to undocumented migrants.

However, documented migrants were found to be significantly more likely to migrate to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and other destination countries. 12 Looking at the average hourly wages in 2012 for non-migrants, returnees, legal, and illegal migrants in Table 3 , we find that the average hourly wage for returnees is higher than non-migrants. 13 We also find that documented migrants have higher hourly wages compared to undocumented migrants upon return.

The modeling framework of CMP is essentially similar to fitting a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model.

An individual decides to migrate when the unobservable latent variable M * capturing the individual gains from migration is positive, while an individual decides to stay if the gains from migration are negative. For identification of equation 2, we use the inflation adjusted oil prices (Oil t ) for each individual at the age of 25, the average age of migration. To obtain an exogenous source of variation in the probability of migration, we follow the same identification strategy proposed by Wahba and Zenou (2012) , Wahba (2015) , and El-Mallakh and Wahba (2021). The rationale behind using historic oil prices as a predictor of the migration probability is that other Arab countries constitute the most important destination for Egyptian migrants, where oil prices played a crucial role in driving the demand for foreign labor both directly in the Gulf countries or indirectly, in other non-oil producing Arab countries. 15 When estimating equation 2, the sample includes return migrants, current migrants, and non-migrants. 16",

Panel A in Figure 2 shows that the two series-oil prices and the share of illegal migrants-do not follow the same trend. Indeed, this figure shows several episodes of spikes in oil prices, during which irregular migration remained low. Conversely, irregular migration was particularly high in the late 1960s and early 1970s-a period with relatively low oil prices. We further corroborate this evidence in Panel B, where we present a scatter plot on the relationship between oil prices and the share of illegal migrants from the 1960s to 2010. Panel B in Figure 2 additionally confirms the orthogonality of oil prices with respect to irregular migration flows.

As Nasser's ideology gained support in various Arab countries, disagreements emerged between Egypt and Arab monarchies, importantly, Saudi Arabia, for which pan-Arabism posed a real threat to its stability. While Egypt's pan-Arab ideology resonated with a number of Arab countries, it also led to conflicting dynamics with the monarchies (Mann, 2012) .

Following these events, the perception of the Arab world towards Egypt changed in particular, since for decades Egypt was presumed to stand for Arab interests. In November 1978, in a summit meeting held in Baghdad, a consensus among Arab countries was reached to impose economic and political sanctions on Egypt (Lavy, 1984; Sullivan, 1999) . Egypt was subsequently suspended from the Arab League from 1979 until 1989. Evidently, this political and economic embargo negatively affected the bilateral relations between Egypt and other Arab countries, as reflected in the sharp drop in diplomatic representation in the 1980s.

For instance, in the years between 1968 and 1980, all migrants went to countries with no diplomatic representation in Egypt. On the other hand, in every single year between 1981 and 1990, migrants predominantly chose to migrate to countries without diplomatic representation in Egypt. Between 1992 and 1995, the majority of migrants chose destinations with diplomatic representation, while a non-negligible share of migrants still migrated to countries with no diplomatic representation. On the other hand, from 1996 onwards, migration was destined to countries with diplomatic exchange but it is important to note that this is a period with little variability in diplomatic representation, as shown in Table A .4 in the Online Appendix.",

First, we find that oil prices are a strong predictor of the probability of migration. In column (1), we find that a one dollar increase in oil prices leads to an increase in the probability of migration by 1.3 percentage points. Diplomatic exchange also plays a crucial role in explaining the legal migrant status. In column (2), we find strong suggestive evidence that negative shocks to the bilateral relations between Egypt and the countries of destination of Egyptian migrants, at the time of migration, drive illegal migration to the destination countries. Indeed, we find that the lack of diplomatic representation of countries of destination in Egypt leads to an increase in the probability of illegal migration by 23 percentage points. As for identification of the return migration, in column (3), we find that an additional active armed conflict that occurs in the destination country at the time of return migration (for return migrants) or at the time of migration (for current migrants) increases the probability of return migration by 5 percentage points. Correcting for this triple selection into migration, illegality, and return, in column (4), we find that illegal migrants witness a wage penalty compared to legal migrants upon return to Egypt.",

Indeed, we find that undocumented migrants primarily return to Egypt due to poor working conditions in the destination. We further showed in this section that migrants' illegal status is associated with lower ranked occupations overseas. These lower ranked jobs are also associated with lower earnings, lower savings, and lower incidence to send remittances. While documented migrants enhance their human capital overseas, which leads to remuneration gains upon return, our findings suggest that the migration experience of an undocumented migrant depletes their human capital, leading to wage losses upon return.",

        "text": "Another potential concern is the endogeneity of the migration duration. This would be problematic if the wage penalty of undocumented return migrants is due to their shorter migration duration compared to documented migrants. While we cannot control for migration duration in our model since it is an endogenous variable and would be considered as a bad control, we address this challenge empirically by focusing on documented and undocumented migrants with similar migration duration. We estimate the impact of illegal status on migrants' wages upon return relying on three separate models in Table 12 . First, we estimate the model by focusing on migrants who belong to the lowest 33 rd percentile of the distribution of migration duration (those who have 2 years of migration or less) and we report the corresponding results in column (4a). Second, we estimate the model by considering returnees who belong to the middle 33 rd percentile of the distribution with 3 to 5 years of migration and we report results in column (4b). Finally, we focus on returnees who belong to the highest 33 rd percentile of migration duration with 6 years of migration or more in column (4c). The first three estimated equations: the probability of emigration, the probability of illegality, and the probability of return migration are the same across the three models. Interestingly, we find that the results are mostly driven by returnees who belong to the upper end of the migration duration distribution-those with 3 years of migration duration or more. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the wage gap between documented and undocumented return migrants grows bigger the longer the migrants stay abroad. Indeed, the predicted probabilities reported at the bottom of Table 12 show that documented migrants' predicted hourly wage upon return appreciates with the length of stay abroad, while undocumented migrants' predicted hourly wage depreciates the longer the migrant's migration spell. These dynamics address the concern that illegal migrants are faring worse due to the shorter migration spells as these results, in fact, show the opposite dynamic; the longer undocumented migrants stay abroad, the more their human capital is depleted. These dynamics are also fully consistent with the theoretical argument of human capital waste for undocumented migrants and on the other hand, with greater human capital accumulation for documented migrants.",

Using unique data from Egypt, we distinguish between return migrants according to their type of international migration-documented versus undocumented-and examine the impact of temporary migration on wages upon return. Relying on a conditional mixed process model, which takes into account the triple selection into emigration, illegality, and return migration, we examine the effect of illegality on wages upon return.",

This suggests that undocumented migrants do not gain from their overseas migration experience in terms of skill acquisition the way documented migrants do. Our results show that the longer undocumented migrants stay abroad, the more their human capital is depleted, while the opposite is true for documented migrants. Indeed, we find evidence that illegal migrants experience a waste of human capital overseas, as they have lower earnings and end up in lower-ranked occupations while abroad, which might explain their lower earnings upon return.",

These findings have important policy implications, as they suggest that there is a need to raise awareness among potential migrants about the negative consequences of illegal migration experiences.

Diplomatic representation is defined as the percent of destination countries with diplomatic representation in Egypt. It is derived from the Correlates of War Diplomatic exchange data set, which is available every five years from 1965 to 2005. The share of migrants is derived from the ELMPS 2012 using information on current, return migration and the year of migration. The share of migrants is aggregated over 5 years to match the level of aggregation of the Correlates of War data set. The dashed line represents a fitted regression line. Notes: This table presents geographical transition matrices for non-migrants (Panel A) and return migrants (Panel B) between the region of birth and the geographical region in 2012. The diagonal cells represent the percentage of individuals who stayed in the same region between the two time periods. The cells above and below the diagonal represent the percentage of individuals who moved to a different region compared to their region of birth. Notes: To compute occupational indices, we regress the log of hourly wage on column (1), the hourly wage in column (2), on the number of years of schooling and its squared term, the work experience and its squared term, controlling for marital status, geographical regions and the number of years in the current job and its squared term for the our estimation sample of returnees. Occupational indices are computed as following: first we multiply the estimated coefficients on the number of years of schooling and its squared term and the number of years of work experience and its squared term, obtained from the wage regression, by the levels for each individual. Second, we sum the resulting products and they are averaged at the ISCO88 1-digit occupation to obtain our occupational rankings. Military occupations are eliminated.

For identification of equation 2, we use the diplomatic exchange, which is the diplomatic representation of each country of destination of Egyptian migrants in Egypt at time of migration. It is a dummy variable equal zero if there is no evidence of diplomatic exchange and is equal one if there is evidence of diplomatic exchange at the level of charg\u00e9 d'affaires, minister, ambassador or other. For identification of equation 3, we use the number of active armed conflicts that is both country and year specific from the Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP). Equations (4a) and (4b) estimate the effect of illegality on the logarithm of hourly wages, conditional on return migration. We estimate two models separately. In equation (4a), we consider voluntary return migration, while in equation 4b, we consider involuntary return migration. The predicted logarithm of hourly wages for illegal migrants, and legal migrants are reported in the last row.",

The data set contains annual observations of all states in the international system between 1946 and 2013. The data is monadic-each observation corresponds to a country-year. It contains information on all internal and internationalized internal armed conflicts, where conflicts are located according to the government side in the conflict.Two versions of the data exist: one containing conflict level variables and one containing dyadic data. The difference between the two data sets is that the former treats all variables at UCDP conflict level, while the latter treats all variables at the UCDP conflict dyad level. For example, if there is one active UCDP conflict in a given country, the number of total conflicts in this country-year will be equal to 1 in the conflict level data set. However, in the dyad version of the data, if this conflict involves different actors, the data will instead report the number of actors involved in the UCDP conflict.In this paper, we rely on the conflict level data set, which is at the country-year level. Importantly, we use information on the total number of active conflicts for a given country-year from the UCDP data set. The Monadic Conflict Onset and Incidence data also contains additional information on the following indicators, among others: the incidence of intrastate conflict, which is coded 1 in all country-years with at least one active conflict, the onset of intrastate conflict, which is coded 1 if the countryyear contains a new conflict, and the intensity level of the conflict in the country-year: minor conflict (>25 deaths) versus war (>1,000 deaths).",

        "text": ".2 in the Online Appendix. This figure presents a scatter plot on the relationship between diplomatic representation and the share of migrants. Diplomatic representation is defined as the percent of destination countries with diplomatic representation in Egypt. The data is available every 5 years from 1965 to 2005. The share of migrants is likewise aggregated over 5 years to match the level of aggregation of the Correlates of War data set. Even though the scatter plot is derived from data of limited sample size,Figure A.2 confirms that migration is not directly influenced by diplomatic exchange, in line withFigure A.1. The correlation coefficient inFigure A.2 is equal to 0.100 with a P-value of 0.799.",
