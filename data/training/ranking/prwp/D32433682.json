        "text": "How should business training programs be priced? Billions of dollars are spent subsidizing entrepreneurship programs around the world, and most of these programs are offered for free or at a token cost in developing countries. 1 However, these programs aim to generate private benefits for the firms participating in them, in the form of higher profits and greater survival, and it is therefore not clear whether or not offering these programs for free to everyone is the optimal use of public money.",

        "text": "Charging a positive price for training can affect how many firms receive training, which firms are trained, and how effective the training is at improving business practices and performance. Higher prices can potentially enable more firms to get trained from a given training budget by improving financial sustainability, but if it is costly to reach firms and market the training to them, could perversely end up reducing the quantity trained if many firms do not want to pay for training. Higher prices can also change the efficiency and equity of which firms are trained. On the positive side, it may help select those entrepreneurs with the highest returns to training, but conversely may screen out liquidity-constrained entrepreneurs with good ideas, and it is possible that those firms who are least willing to pay may benefit more from training. 2 Finally, by paying for training, a psychological or sunk-cost effect may operate whereby entrepreneurs then value the training more, and exert more effort in the learning process. While these different channels are theoretically possible, what is missing is empirical evidence on how sensitive training demand is to price, on which individuals are willing to pay higher prices, and on whether this sunk cost effect operates in practice. This paper provides the first experimental estimates of how the demand for business training varies with price. The training program consists of 40 hours of classes spread over 10 weeks, and combines both training on standard business practices with modules on soft-skills training focused on personal initiative, which teaches entrepreneurs to develop a pro-active entrepreneurial mindset (Frese and Gielnik, 2014; Frese et al., 2016) . It costs the provider approximately J$20,000 (US$150) per participant. We use two samples of Jamaican entrepreneurs and two different methodologies to elicit how willingness to pay for this training varies with price. First, we conduct a selective trial (Chassang et al., 2012 ) with a sample of 457 entrepreneurs. We use a version of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method (Becker et al., 1964) to elicit willingness to pay for training, and then randomize offered prices to assign entrepreneurs to training if price is not above willingness to pay. In this experiment we also embed two interventions designed to test how credit constraints and discount-framing affect how sensitive entrepreneurs are to price, by varying whether participants can pay for the course in installments versus all at once, and whether the price is framed as a discount on the full cost of the course or not. Second, we randomize take-it-or-leave-it (TIOLI) offers comprising four levels of prices with a sample of 374 entrepreneurs.",

        "text": "We find that the demand for business training is price-inelastic, but that moving from free training to prices that cover more than a token share of the cost of provision does dramatically reduce demand. In our BDM sample, 76 percent of entrepreneurs attend at least one training class when it is free, 65 percent when they have to pay a nominal fee of 5%, 43 percent when charged one-quarter the cost, 29 percent when charged half the cost, and only 11 percent when charged the full cost. Offering the opportunity to pay in three installments, or framing the price as a discount relative to the actual cost did not affect demand. In our TIOLI sample, which consists of somewhat wealthier entrepreneurs with larger firms, 90 percent attend at least one class when it is free, and demand falls to 48 percent when charged half the cost, and 37 percent when charged three-quarters the cost, with again no impact of offering the opportunity to pay in installments. 3 We can then use this variation in willingness to pay to examine the correlates of higher demand for training, and thereby learn which entrepreneurs are excluded from training by charging higher prices. We find that willingness to pay is positively correlated with wealth, younger age, risk propensity and larger business size (volume of sales). This implies that higher prices screen out poorer and older entrepreneurs with smaller businesses, who are not so willing to take the risk of purchasing the course. Higher prices do not appear to differentially affect female business owners. This screening effect of charging for training will be concerning for organizations with a mandate to serve the poor. However, it may be efficient if price selects those with the largest treatment effects. Sample sizes in the existing literature have been insufficient to draw reliable inferences on which firms benefit most from training (McKenzie, 2020) , and our sample sizes and attrition rates likewise prevent us from measuring accurately heterogeneity in treatment effects by willingness to pay. However, we do at least see that willingness to pay increases with what entrepreneurs expect their returns to the training will be, suggesting that charging for training may help in targeting training to those it will benefit more.",

McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) found that, on average, only 65 percent of those invited to training attend when it is free among 14 different randomized trials. In our BDM sample, which already consists of firms that had at least expressed enough interest in training to attend a demonstration session, only 76 percent of those offered the training for free attended at least one session, and the mean firm attended only 5.4 out of 10 sessions. We find that entrepreneurs who have a higher willingness-to-pay for training are more likely to attend training when selected, so that charging for training helps screen out those individuals who are less likely to show up.",

        "text": "Taken together, our results suggest the optimal price for business training is unlikely to be either free or full cost. Charging for training does screen out those firm owners who are less likely to attend, selects those who expect to benefit more from it, and induces more effort in attending training. But a lot of these effects occur from charging only one-quarter of the full cost, and charging close to or at full recovery cost ends up screening out many business owners and increasing recruiting costs. This paper contributes to two main literatures. The first is a literature on business training programs in developing countries. Business training is one of the most common forms of firm support offered by governments, and a growing number of impact evaluations have offered various training programs to firms for free in order to measure impacts on business practices and firm performance. McKenzie (2020) provides a recent review and meta-analysis, finding that the typical training program increases profits and sales by an average of 5 to 10 percent. Training programs that go beyond teaching business practices to teach personal initiative, a psychological-based mindset intervention, have had larger impacts on firm growth in Uganda (Glaub et al., 2014) and Togo (Campos et al., 2017) .",

        "text": "The second literature this paper contributes to is one on methods to estimate the demand for products or services. Recent applications in development economics have used two main methods: the Take-it-or-leave-it (TIOLI) method and the BDM mechanism. The TIOLI method consists in randomizing the offer price that potential clients face and to observe whether the product/service is purchased or not at that price. Due to its simplicity, it has been widely used to inform the debate on the pricing of health products (See Dupas and Miguel (2017) for a recent survey). Alternatively, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method allows obtaining the exact willingness to pay for each participant, which gives more power to detect heterogeneous treatment effects of the services provided (Becker et al., 1964) . Recent examples include Ben Yishay et al. (2017) for latrines, Hoffmann 2018for water purifiers, Grimm and Hartwig (2018) for eyeglasses, and Grimm et al. (2020) for solar kits. Two recent papers compare demand estimates obtained with TIOLI and BDM, and find largely consistent results (Berry et al. (2020) for water filters, and Cole et al. (2020) for rainfall insurance and agricultural information), although with some differences arising.",

        "text": "Our intervention takes place in Jamaica, an upper-middle-income country of just under 3 million people, whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism and remittances. There is a large informal sector, comprising around 40% of non-agricultural employment, and over 400,000 self-employed workers (MICAF, 2017) . These businesses face challenges that are both internal and external to their operations. On the internal side, many small businesses are poorly managed, with MICAF (2017) stating that \"Many businesses are characterized by entrepreneurs that lack marketing capacity, operational capacity, business leadership, financial acumen, communication skills, and are generally unfamiliar with available business support services\" (p. viii). This motivates the need for business training. On the external side, World Bank Group (2019), notes that Jamaica ranks well in terms of the ease of opening a business and access to credit, but that key challenges for operating a business in Jamaica are the enforcement of contracts, taxes, property registration and electricity provision. The lack of contract enforcement is a particularly relevant challenge for our intervention, which relies on entrepreneurs paying the amount they commit to pay after signing a contract. Moreover, very high crime rates and a high prevalence of scams by call centers erode trust among local entrepreneurs, which affects recruitment and survey response. 5 We partnered with the Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC), a government agency of Jamaica with the mandate to boost the development of micro, small and mediumsized enterprises (MSMEs). It is assigned in the National MSMEs and Entrepreneurship Policy as the lead agency charged with the execution of business training. It provides services across the spectrum, from guiding start-ups to a wide range of consultancy services for more established businesses. In 2016-2017, Ubfal et al. (2019) conducted a randomized controlled trial with JBDC in Kingston to estimate the effect of two business training programs combining hard and soft skills. Training courses were fully subsidized to participants. JBDC would have been unable to continue offering these courses free of cost without external subsidies. They estimate the cost of the training to be around 20 thousand Jamaican dollars (around US$150), but they were not sure how much Jamaican entrepreneurs would be willing to pay for it. They were therefore interested in learning what the willingness to pay for training was among different groups of entrepreneurs in Jamaica.",

We therefore worked closely with them to recruit the types of firms they would typically be interested in serving. Our recruitment process was divided into two phases. In the first phase, which was used for selecting firms to take part in the BDM elicitation method, we targeted firms in the Western regions of Jamaica (the parishes of St. James, Westmoreland, Trelawny, Hanover, Manchester and Saint Ann). These parishes include the second-largest city in Jamaica, Montego Bay. The second phase, used to select firms for the take-it-or-leave-it (TIOLI) approach, recruited mainly around the capital city of Kingston (72%), with the remainder from Montego Bay and surrounding parishes.",

A short baseline survey was conducted on the phone or online upon enrollment in the study to provide basic background on the firm, including characteristics that can be used to examine what factors help predict willingness to pay. This process launched in late June 2017 and was extended until May 2018. Overall, 1,823 entrepreneurs showed interest in the training and answered the baseline survey. We dropped 8 respondents who reported not having a business, and one respondent who did not provide any contact details. We also removed from the sample 20 outliers in terms of monthly sales (more than US$10,000) and 9 entrepreneurs with more than 15 employees. 6 This left 1,782 eligible entrepreneurs who were invited to come to demonstration sessions conducted at the JBDC facilities that were closest to the business of the respondent.",

The BDM sample is smaller in size on average than the TIOLI sample. Only 39 percent of firms in the BDM sample have any paid employees, and only 4 percent more than 5 employees, compared to 44 percent with employees and 17 percent with more than 5 employees in the TIOLI sample.

Only 14-15% in both samples indicate they would not be able to finance an investment of J$20,000 (the cost of the course).

To test for framing effects, we randomize the way the questions in the elicitation are asked. The standard questions asks: \"are you willing to pay X Jamaican dollars for the course?\", while the question for the discount-framing group emphasizes the discount: \"are you willing to pay X Jamaican dollars for the course? This would be a discount of Y% over 20,000, the cost per person of providing the course.\" Both treatments are randomized by randomly ordering the forms read to each participant in batches of 4 (standard, credit, discount frame, credit and discount frame). Table A2 shows that firm and demographic characteristics are well balanced across treatments.

In this group, 318 participants were assigned a positive price for the course, but only 46% of them paid the agreed amount for the course, while 50% paid at least part of the agreed amount. One possible reason for this is that, unlike the case of many BDM elicitations, participants did not pay on the spot. This occurred for three reasons. First, since the courses would not start for several weeks after the demonstration session, JBDC did not want to require payment until the start date. Second, since the cost of the course could be sizeable relative to firm profits in the case of getting a high price drawn, they wanted to give firm owners time to collect together the money. Third, most small firm owners did not have credit cards, and given high crime rates, JBDC wanted to avoid asking firm owners to show up to a group demonstration session with a large amount of cash on hand. Given this time to pay, some participants may have therefore changed their minds, leading to reneging on their commitment to pay.",

If this is the case, then our measure of willingness to pay for the course may be upward-biased. Table 2 presents evidence that our WTP measure is still informative about demand. We see that for those who purchased the course, a measure of consumer surplus (i.e. the difference between WTP and the price offered) is highly correlated with paying in full the offered price (Column 1), coming at least one class to the course (Column 2), and the number of classes attended (Column 3). However, this table can also be interpreted as evidence for over-reporting WTP as in Hoffmann (2018) .

Our first measure of demand is whether entrepreneurs purchased the course according to the BDM procedure (i.e., their WTP was at least as high as the offered price) regardless of whether they actually paid. Table 4 shows how the randomly offered price affects this outcome. In Column (1), we use a continuous measure for price offered. Demand is downward sloping, with the point estimate indicating that a J$1,000 increase in price reduces take-up by 3.3 percentage points. In Column (2) we include binary variables for each level of price offered to entrepreneurs. Increases in the price from 0 (the omitted category) to $1,000 or $3,000 do not have statistically significant effects on demand. However, extra increases in price reduce demand significantly. Indeed, we can reject that the reduction in demand is linear with prices. 14 For example, charging a price equal to the cost of the course (J$20,000) would reduce demand by 67 percentage points. While columns (1) and (2) show that raising the price towards the cost of providing the training has a large impact on demand, the coefficients also imply that demand is price-inelastic. For example, doubling the price reduces demand by less than one half. Demand is more inelastic at lower prices: moving from J$1,000 to full price has a price elasticity of -0.04; moving from J$5,000 to full price a price elasticity of -0.22; and moving from half price (J$10,000) to full price a price elasticity of -0.59.

In Columns (4)-(6), we use actual payment of the full price offered for the course as our measure of demand. In this case, the decrease in demand with price is even more pronounced: a J$1,000 increase in price reduces demand by 4.7 percentage points. Moreover, while we can still reject linearity of price effects, the pattern of effects is reversed: the decrease in demand is now higher at lower prices than at higher prices. 15 This means that charging higher prices for the course, even at a fraction of its actual cost, discourages an important share of entrepreneurs from taking it. 16 In Columns 3and 6we see that the credit and discount frame treatments do not have significant effects on demand. The fact that credit does not play an important role affecting demand is in line with the sample not reporting significant credit constraints at the full cost of the course. However, the interaction of credit and discount frame has a significant negative effect on the probability of paying (Column 6), but not on willingness to pay (Column 3). One possibility is that the combination of discount and credit was perceived as a negative signal of the quality of the course, but it has to be a signal that affects only actual payment, since we do not see effects in willingness to pay. Figure 1 presents a graphical illustration of the demand schedule based on elicited willingness to pay in the BDM sample, by treatment arm. We see demand is similar across treatment arms at most price levels. If anything, the discount framing alone reduces demand at higher price levels, perhaps because the discount implied is not that high. The first row of Table 7 presents detailed summary statistics by price offered. We find that 32 percent of the sample report a willingness to pay at least as high as the full cost of the course; 78 percent report being willing to pay a price as high as half of the cost of the course, and 94 percent a price of 25 percent of the cost.

A second market failure is credit constraints: firms may find it harder to borrow to finance training, an intangible asset, than to finance assets, which can be seized by a bank in the event of non-repayment. There is strong evidence that many small firms are credit-constrained, but much weaker evidence to support the view that this is the key constraint to them purchasing business training services. A third possibility is insurance market failures, with firm owners reluctant to take training even if they think it has a high expected payoff, because they are unable to insure against the possibility that it does not work. There is some recent evidence to support the view that risk is a constraint to start-up and investment in small businesses (e.g. Bianchi and Bobba (2012) ), but no evidence we are aware that shows that alleviating this constraint leads to more purchases of training.",

        "text": "However, in practice our ability to estimate these heterogeneous treatment effects is limited for several reasons. First, the logistical difficulties implementing BDM resulted in a smaller than desired sample size, more participants assigned to treatment than control, and lower take-up of training, all of which reduce statistical power. Second, in our six to nine-month follow-up survey, attrition rates were high and strongly correlated with treatment. Only 40 percent of those who were not offered the training because of the BDM rule completed the follow-up survey, and completion rates were 32 percentage points higher for the group assigned to training. Given this large difference, we weight observations using the inverse probability of attrition weights, but still view these results as, at best, suggestive only. Table 11 reports the impact of attending at least one class of the training on eight outcomes: three measures of intermediate channels training is intended to improve (business practices, personal initiative, and business knowledge), and five measures of firm performance (having at least one employee, having positive sales and profits, and the winsorized levels of sales and profits). 25 Panel A shows the main effects. We see a strong significant effect on the share of business practices adopted (an increase of 16 percentage points) and no effects on personal initiative, which is consistent with the findings in Ubfal et al. (2019) . We also see significant effects on a dummy for having positive profits and on the winsorized level of profits (significant at the 10 percent level). 26 The impacts on knowledge, having employees and sales are positive, but are with large standard errors and are not statistically significant. These results are consistent with many of the experiments surveyed by McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) , which find business training improves business practices, but that it is harder to measure impacts on business performance in smaller samples.",

In our case, a large share of participants refused to pay the agreed price, even after signing a contract where they committed to pay that price. To improve this, one would like to charge participants on the spot, by having them use cash or a credit card to guarantee the price they are willing to pay. This is likely to be difficult in many contexts of informal firm owners who lack trust, do not wish to carry large amounts of cash, and do not have credit cards.

For example, if JBDC wants to train 1,000 firms like those in the BDM sample, what price should it charge to minimize its costs of doing so? The answer depends not just on the cost of training, but also on the costs of recruitment and training demonstrations, and on the impact of price on having people show up and attend training. It costs US$25,117 to recruit 831 firms to attend demonstration sessions. This includes the costs of telemarketers to call firms, advertising costs, venue hire, JBDC staff travel costs, and paying the trainers to conduct the demonstration sessions.24  Taken together, this works out to be US$30 per firm that takes part in the training demonstration, or approximately 20 percent of the cost of training.",
