A strong momentum in investment reflecting rising productivity, healthy corporate profits, and robust exports has fueled a buoyant economic growth exceeding 7% a year in India for almost a decade. Economic growth has increased employment opportunities and allowed millions to emerge from poverty. 3 Economic expansion is also often accompanied by rising demands on the already scarce and often degraded natural resources (soils, fossil fuels, water and forests) and the increasing pollution footprint will negatively impact human health and growth prospects. In India's case, a remarkable growth record has been clouded by a degrading environment and growing scarcity of natural resources. Mirroring the size and diversity of its economy, environmental risks are wide ranging and are driven by both poverty and prosperity. Environmental sustainability could become the next major economic challenge as India surges along its growth trajectory.",

The estimates are based on a combination of Indian data from secondary sources and on the transfer of unit costs of pollution from a range of national and international studies (a process known as benefit transfer).

Environmental economics relies heavily on other fields within economics, such as econometrics, welfare economics, public economics, and project economics. New techniques and methodologies have been developed in recent decades to better understand and quantify preferences and values of individuals and communities in the context of environmental quality, conservation of natural resources, and environmental health risks. The results from these techniques and methodologies can then be, and often are, utilized by policy makers and stakeholders in the process of setting environmental objectives and priorities. And, because preferences and values are expressed in monetary terms, the results provide some guidance for the allocation of public and private resources across diverse sectors in the course of socio-economic development.",

Thus, damages to health from air or water pollution are included as well as damages from 3 deforestation. The term cost means the opportunity cost to society, i.e., what is given up or lost, by taking a course of action. When goods traded in markets are damaged, prices and knowledge of consumer preferences for the damaged goods (embodied in the demand function) and production information (embodied in the supply function) provide the necessary information for computing social costs. Estimating social costs from reduced productivity of agricultural land due to erosion, salinity or other forms of land degradation is a good example. However, many damages from environmental causes are to \"goods,\" such as health, that are not traded in markets. In these cases, economists have devised a number of methods for estimating social costs based on derived preferences from observable or hypothetical behavior and choices.",

If the person who is ill or who is providing care for someone who is ill does not otherwise has a job the financial cost of time losses is zero. However, even in such a case the person is normally engaged in activities that are valuable for the family and time losses reduce the amount of time available for these activities. Thus, there is a social cost of time losses to the family. In an economic costing exercise this is normally valued at the opportunity cost of time, i.e. the salary, or a fraction of the salary that the individual could earn if he or she chose to work for income. In summary, social costs are preferred over financial costs because social costs capture the cost and reduced welfare to society as a whole. All costs are estimated as flow values (annual losses).",

        "text": "Similarly, while India has been phasing out lead in gasoline since 2001 there are a number of other sources that are not controlled. This is probably due to the fact that some gasoline is still produced with lead due the presence of lead in pipes, drinking water, soils, food, paints, and other products. Lead exposure could result in substantial mortality from diseases associated with high blood pressure among adults and IQ reduction and Mild Mental Retardation. While some studies have suggested high levels of lead among urban population (both children and adults) in there is great uncertainty about current BLL in the urban population as a whole (and the rural population). It is therefore necessary to undertake new studies of BLL in children and adults to provide a more accurate estimate of health effects and their costs taking into account the gradual lead phase-out in India. In addition to the mid-point values, \"low\" and \"high\" estimates of annual costs are presented in Table 2 .1. The \"low\" and \"high\" range estimates differ considerably across the categories because of the uncertainties related to economic valuation procedure or uncertainties about exposure to specific hazards. The urban air pollution estimate range is mainly affected by the social cost of mortality which is derived by applying two different valuation techniques (Section III.1). The range for indoor air pollution arises mainly from the uncertainty of exposure level to indoor smoke and from the use of fuel wood (Section V). In the case of agricultural soil degradation, the range is associated with uncertainty of yield losses from salinity (Section VI.1). The range for water supply, sanitation and hygiene is in large part associated with uncertainties regarding estimates of diarrheal child mortality and morbidity (Section IV). The range for deforestation is associated with the uncertainty of the use benefits of forest (Section VII). If we take the lower bound of the estimates, the figures are about 45 percent of the mean values (or 2.6 percent of GDP), while if we take the upper bound they are 64 percent higher than the mean (or about 8.9 percent of GDP) 4 . 4 Adding up of lower or higher bounds reflects only differences in calculation, and not actual changes in losses, associated with environmental degradation . A midpoint estimate presents an average of low and high estimates, the range is related to both uncertainties of valuation method and uncertainties of exposure to specific hazards.",

First the losses related to water and sanitation and hygiene are likely to be concentrated among the poor who most often do not have access to piped water or sanitation. Second the rural population is more affected by the water and indoor air pollution-related damages than the urban population. For the urban population the distribution of impacts by income class is less certain. Some studies indicate that urban ambient air quality does affect the poor more than the rich (Garg, 2011) but the present study has not been able to confirm this point. In overall terms, however, it is very likely the case that the poorer urban population suffers more both from urban air pollution and inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene and in general it is the poor who are included in all major cost categories (those who live in big cities and use solid fuel for cooking).

Other gaseous pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, CO, and ozone) are generally not thought to be as damaging as fine particulates. However, SO 2 and NOx may have important health consequences because they can react with other substances in the atmosphere to form secondary particulates. In particular, the evidence implicates sulfates formed from SO2, but is much less certain about nitrates, formed from NOx.",

The monetary value of these preferences, or willingness to pay, when divided by the relevant risk reduction yields the value of statistical life (VSL).

The discount rate commonly applied is the rate of time preference. Thus the social cost of mortality, according to the HCA, is the discounted future income of an individual at the time of death.

The GDP per capita growth rate was computed in the CGE model for India (see World Bank forthcoming report \"Economic Growth and Environmental Sustainability\"). Since the real growth of GDP per capita is quite high, it should be accounted for in determining the social discount rate.

In this case, the HCA can be applied to non-income earners and children (whether or not children will become income earners or take care of the home during their adult life). In the case of the elderly, the HCA would not assign an economic value to old individuals that have either retired from the workforce or do not make significant contributions to household work.

Everyone in society is constantly facing a certain risk of dying. Examples of such risks are occupational fatality risks, risks of traffic accident fatality, and environmental mortality risks. It has been observed that individuals adjust their behavior and decisions in relation to such risks. For instance, individuals demand a higher wage (a wage premium) for a job that involves a higher than average occupational risk of fatal accident, individuals may purchase safety equipment to reduce the risk of death, and/or individuals and families may be willing to pay a premium or higher rent for properties (land and buildings) in a cleaner and less polluted neighborhood or city.",

Electricity generation is responsible for a fraction of PM pollution analyzed in this study 8 . Estimated new cases of chronic bronchitis are about 48,000 per year. Annual hospitalizations due to pollution are estimated at close to 370 thousand and emergency room visits/outpatient hospitalizations at 7,300 thousand per year.
