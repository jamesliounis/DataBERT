Net enrollment in government primary schools remained unchanged over the ten-year period from 1997 to 2006, despite the abolition of fees, and fell significantly for wealthier groups. 1 Meanwhile, both net enrollment and fee rates in private 1 The net enrollment rate (NER) measures the proportion of children of the appropriate age group who are currently in school. For primary net enrollment this consists of all children ages 6 to 13, and for secondary net enrollment ages 14 to 19. Gross enrollment rates (GER) discussed later in the text measure the ratio of total enrollment, including pupils outside these age brackets, to the number of school-age children.

Earlier studies mainly find a positive effect on school enrollment as a whole, but potentially obscure important differences in the role of public and private schools in these reforms. In Uganda, for instance, Klaus Deininger (2003) shows that the introduction of free schooling was associated with a large increase in enrollment, while Mikiko Nishimura, Takashi Yamano & Yuichi Sasoka (2008) find an increase in grade attainment and a reduction in delayed school entry. In Cambodia, Maria Cheung, Andreas Madestam & Jakob Svensson (2011) exploit variation in the abolition of fees across regions in a difference-in-differences framework. They find positive average effects of fee abolition on enrollment but substantial heterogeneity, with impacts concentrated among higher ability and wealthier students. In both cases, the survey data presented do not distinguish between enrollment in public and private schools, so it is impossible to know from these studies whether demand for public schools rose or fell as a result of fee removal or to test for potential trade-offs between access and quality.",

        "text": "The national trends we document in Kenya stand in tension with a growing body of experimental evidence showing that even modest user fees constitute a significant deterrent to utilization of health and education services in developing countries (Kremer & Holla 2009) . Evaluations of more targeted social programs which reduce the direct or indirect cost of schooling for some portion of pupils generally find strong evidence of downward-sloping demand curves for schooling. Felipe Barrera-Osorio, Leigh L. Linden & Miguel Urquiola (2007) examine a targeted, means-tested waiver for school fees in Bogota, Colombia, finding an increase in enrollment of 3%. Similarly, Evan Borkum (2012) analyzes a reduction in secondary school fees in South Africa targeted at poor households, finding a statistically significant 2% increase in enrollment. Deon Filmer & Norbert Schady (2011) examine experimental evidence from a conditional cash transfer program in Cambodia. They replicate findings from, e.g., T. Paul Schultz (2004) who finds significant positive effects of Mexico's PROGRESA cash transfer program on enrollment, but demonstrate that these effects are subject to strongly diminishing returns as the size of the transfer is increased. These findings are consistent with our results for poorer households. However, by targeting a sub-set of poorer households, these programs may implicitly restrict their focus to partial equilibrium effects, whereas we attempt below to examine the potentially off-setting general equilibrium effects of fee abolition. (Note that all three of the mechanisms linking free schooling to education quality outlined above are consistent with downward-sloping demand curves in controlled experiments, but could produce different outcomes when prices fall for all children simultaneously.)",

Total expenditure on both public and private secondary schooling declined (by 18% of total expenditure and 47% of fees in the public sector, and by 2% of total expenditure and 24% of fees in private secondary schools). This is consistent with a gradual erosion in the real price of public secondary schools, and the lack of demand pressure in the private sector of the same magnitude as seen in private primary schools.

Under this scenario, FPE implies a reduction in per pupil funding only for the wealthiest households, whose head had some tertiary education. Figure 2c summarizes the net changes in funding per pupil under these three scenarios. A few general conclusions appear quite robust. The impact of FPE on funding levels in public schools was likely heterogeneous across socio-economic groups. These heterogeneous changes in funding were pro-poor.

The authors find no such effect and as a consequence conclude that signaling is not important in educational attainment in the UK. Maurice Boissiere, John B Knight & Richard H Sabot (1985) find that there are large returns to cognitive achievementas measured by literacy and numeracy scores -and low returns to reasoning ability -measured by performance on Raven's matrices -in Kenyan and Tanzanian labour markets. They interpret this as evidence for a human capital model of education, and against a signaling model. 15 Identification requires that the instrument contain information on schools in the pupil's choice set which do not affect the pupil's utility once not chosen. Identification could therefore in principle still be achieved if spillovers are very localized.

Specifically, the negative IV spillover effects are roughly 20% smaller in both the government and the private sector when considering the share of the most educated children.
