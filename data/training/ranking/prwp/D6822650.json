In most countries, households are required to send school-aged children to school and to take younger children for regular visits to health centers, where they receive nutritional supplements and growth monitoring.

This is a large program-in 2004, the BDH budget was approximately 0.7 percent of GDP. Unlike most other cash transfer programs in Latin America, the BDH program did not explicitly make transfers conditional on changes in household behavior. That being said, because the original intent was to model the BDH on PROGRESA, program administrators stressed the importance of school enrollment when signing up households for transfers. For a brief period, BDH television spots that explicitly discussed how parents were responsible for the schooling and health status of their children were aired on national television. As a result, some households believed that there was an enrollment requirement associated with the program, even though no requirement was ever monitored or enforced in Ecuador. We exploit this quirk in the administration of the BDH program to assess the importance of conditions attached to cash transfers.",

For example, households could mis-represent their socioeconomic status if they believe that this makes it more likely that they will receive transfers in the future, or they could over-state investments in schooling if they think this is a condition for transfers.

We cannot fully rule out such concerns, although we believe they are unlikely to be a serious problem for our analysis for a number of reasons. During training, enumerators were instructed that they should not identify themselves as associated with the BDH program or its evaluation under any circumstances; if questioned, enumerators were to state that the information given by households would in no way affect eligibility for social programs, including the BDH program. Both of these were verified during spot visits in the field. Moreover, questions about the BDH program were included in the last module of the survey, well after respondents had provided information about household characteristics and (critically) schooling and work of children. Finally, reducing child work is not a stated BDH program objective, and child work was not a focus of the BDH information campaign. Nonetheless, we find that BDH transfers led to significant reductions in child work. We also find that households that were randomized into the treatment group had larger increases in expenditures on schooling than other households. It is not obvious months. In the study sample, 92 percent of households who ever withdrew transfers according to the banking records did so at least 10 times over the 19-month period, and more than three-quarters of recipient households received a total amount equivalent to 19 monthly transfers. 4 Of the 1309 households in the sample, 494 (38 percent) are untreated by both measures, and 672 (51 percent) are treated by both measures. Only 22 households (2 percent) appear as treated in the banking records but not the household survey, and 121 (9 percent) appear as treated in the household survey, but not the banking records. The national identification number was used to merge the surveys and the banking records. Discrepancies could arise if enumerators failed to collect the identification numbers of all household members, or made errors copying the numbers. In addition, the banking records do not cover the small fraction of households, approximately 2 percent, who generally collect transfers from the Banco Nacional de Fomento, rather than the consortium of private banks in Banred.",

Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation of a given variable for lottery losers, the difference between lottery winners and losers, and the standard error of this difference. 7 The sample for these calculations is limited to children ages 6-17 at baseline who were re-interviewed in the follow-up survey. Data on all key variables are available for all households in the sample, with the exception of parental education, which is missing in a small number of cases. The reason for this is that respondents did not always know the education of a child's parent when the parent did not live in the household. Although random assignment was successful, there is unfortunately an imperfect match between assignment to a study group and receipt of BDH transfers. Program take-up among lottery winners was 78 percent; lack of information, the cost of traveling to a bank, and stigma may all have discouraged some households from receiving transfers. More worryingly, 264 of 632 households (42 percent) assigned to the control group received transfers. The precise reasons for this substantial contamination are unclear. Conversations with BDH administrators suggest that the list of households that had been randomized out was not passed on in time to operational staff activating households for transfers. This situation was corrected after a few weeks, but withholding transfers from households that had already begun to receive them was judged to be politically imprudent. 7 Differences and standard errors are computed by regressing the variable in question-for example, log per capita expenditures at baseline-on a dummy variable for lottery winners. When variables are child-specific, as is the case with enrollment, child age and gender, the unit of observation is the child, and standard errors are corrected for correlations across children within households. When variables refer to all children in a household, as is the case for log per capita expenditures, parental education, and the measures of household size and composition, the unit of observation is the household. 8 Further evidence of the exogeneity of study group assignment is provided by a regression of a dummy variable for lottery winners on all of the variables in the table. The R-squared in this regression is 0.01, and an F-test fails to reject the null hypothesis of joint insignificance of all variables (p-value: 0.20). Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of households that did and did not receive BDH transfers. The table shows that children in households that received transfers were significantly more likely to be enrolled at baseline; fathers' education for treated households was 0.52 years higher, and mothers' education 0.60 years higher. Both of these differences are large, amounting to about one-fifth of a standard deviation, and highly significant; the heads of households that received transfers were also significantly more likely to be literate. Finally, households that received transfers were larger, and there are some differences in household composition.",

These values are comparable to those found in other developing countries-see the review in Behrman and Knowles (1997) . Suppose the measure of observed log total household expenditures at baseline were \"true\" expenditures X i *, uncontaminated by measurement error. Mis-measured expenditures X i can then be simulated by adding a normally distributed measurement error e i , so that X i * = X i + e i , where e i is N~(0, \u03c3), and \u03c3 is given by the observed standard deviation of log expenditures at baseline (0.521). The reliability ratio can then be calculated from a regression of X i * on X i (Angrist and Krueger 1999) . The mean coefficient on X i from one hundred repetitions of this simulation is 0.496, implying proportional attenuation of 0.504 in the estimated cross-sectional relationship between enrollment and log household income. When the same simulations are conducted with more measurement error, so that \u03b5 i is N~(0, 2\u03c3), the mean estimated reliability ratio is 0.199. Clearly, log household expenditures would have to be very causality from enrollment to income may be a concern if working children are less likely to be enrolled in school; omitted variables could introduce biases if higher income reflects higher parental ability, and this is correlated across generations through genetic endowments. To get a sense for the magnitude of the problem, we regressed enrollment on the log of total household expenditures, with expenditures instrumented with the measures of housing conditions and durables-see for example Glewwe and Jacoby (1995) and Behrman and Knowles (1999) for a similar approach. The coefficient on expenditures in this regression is 0.056, with a standard error of 0.026. Dwelling characteristics and durables are not perfect instruments for expenditures because they could be correlated with permanent income. Still, a comparison of these results with those in Table 5 also suggests that the BDH effects are large. In a paper on the South African pension scheme, Case and Deaton (1998) argue that pension income is spent like other income, so that \"a rand is always a rand\". In Ecuador, it seems, a dollar is not always a dollar, at least not when the dollar is a BDH transfer.",

We then discarded from the sample of unconditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was below the 10 th percentile of the sample of conditioned households; similarly, we discarded from the sample of conditioned households all households whose predicted probability of being conditioned was above the 90 th percentile of the sample of unconditioned households. After trimming of this sort, there are no significant differences between conditioned and unconditioned households in any of the characteristics in Table 2 . Trimming thus makes the samples of conditioned and unconditioned households more closely comparable, although there may still be unobservable differences between the two groups. Table 6 reports the effects of winning the BDH lottery, for conditioned and unconditioned households, and separately for the full and trimmed samples. The table shows that the lottery effects on enrollment for conditioned households range from 0.073 to 0.130, while those for unconditioned households range from 0.014 to 0.021, and are insignificant.",

Yet recent reviews conclude that remarkably little is known about the effect of policies on education outcomes (Glewwe 2002) and child labor (Edmonds 2005) . This paper shows that cash transfers made by the BDH program in Ecuador had large, positive effects on school enrollment, and large, negative effects on child work. In terms of magnitude, the estimated BDH program effects are substantially larger than those associated with the much-studied PROGRESA program in Mexico. These differences are noteworthy given that the transfer is a much larger fraction of household expenditures in Mexico than in Ecuador, and that an enrollment requirement was never explicitly enforced or monitored in Ecuador. Ecuador is a substantially poorer country than Mexico and school enrollment rates are lower, which likely explains the larger program effects associated with the BDH program.",

For example, monitoring is much more stringent in the PROGRESA-Oportunidades programs in Mexico than in the Bolsa Escola-Bolsa Familia programs in Brazil. Results for the BDH program suggest that cash transfer programs can have large effects on schooling and child labor outcomes even when enrollment requirements are not monitored. It is possible, however, that the effect of unenforced conditions will dissipate in the long run as households realize that they will not be penalized if they do not send their children to school, and adjust their behavior accordingly.

The first specification includes only controls for the gender and age of the child (dummy variables by single years of age). These are included because they add precision-results are very similar when no controls are included in the regression.

These results show that treated children are more likely to be enrolled, less likely to drop out of school, and more likely to be new enrollments; the estimated effect of the BDH program on enrollment is between 9.8 and 12.8 percentage points.The child work regressions suggest that children are less likely to be working at the time of the follow-up, more likely to have stopped working, and less likely to have started working between the two surveys; the estimated effect of the program on child work is between 15.4 and 20.7 percentage points. The coefficients are similar across specifications with more or less controls, and tend to be somewhat larger when the banking records are used to determine treatment status.Cash transfers made by the BDH program in Ecuador had large, positive effects on school enrollment, and large, negative effects on child work. One way to benchmark the BDH program effects is to compare them with those found in PROGRESA, the conditional cash transfer program in Mexico. A simple average of the PROGRESA program effects for all grades reported inSchultz (2004) suggests a \"mean\" effect of 3.5 percentage points on enrollment, with the largest effect, 11.1 percentage points, among children enrolled in grade 6, the last year of primary. By comparison, the instrumental variables point estimate for 6 th graders in the BDH program suggests a program effect of 17.8 percentage points, and the average of coefficients from grade-specific regressions suggests a \"mean\" program effect of 8.6 percentage points.14",

Yet the instrumental variables estimates inTable 5suggest an impact of between 8.6 and 11.6 percentage points-more than a full order of magnitude larger. Moreover, one would not expect households receiving BDH transfers to increase expenditures by a full $15 per month, for a variety of reasons: First, households may save part of the transfer, or may offset it with reductions in labor supply-in either case a $15 transfer would translate into a smaller amount in terms of per capita expenditure. Second, the banking records suggest that some households did not collect the full amount of transfers for which they were eligible.There are of course a variety of concerns with simple regressions of enrollment on expenditures. Measurement error in expenditures is likely, but simulation results suggest it would have to be implausibly large to cause attenuation bias of more than 90 percent; 15 reverse15",
