During the pandemic, the number of the extremely poor grew from 648 million to 719 million globally (World Bank, 2022) . Social unrest is rising, especially in middle-income countries, interpersonal trust is at its lowest recorded level globally, and the fallout from COVID-19 has driven the largest increase in global inequality since the Second World War (Yonzan et al., 2022; ACLED, 2022) . The world is becoming more divided and less equal: one in three people is at risk of social exclusion due to their economic status, gender or gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, age, sexual orientation, or disability (Cuesta, L\u00f3pez-Noval, and Ni\u00f1o-Zaraz\u00faa, 2022) .",

        "text": "The process of development is often slow and nonlinear, as well as inherently complex and challenging. By changing how people live, development affects social systems in often unpredictable and destabilizing ways. When sustained over time, however, it can promote cohesive, inclusive, and resilient societies in which all can participate and thrive. Yet sustainable economic growth is not guaranteed unless progress is also made on social (and environmental) sustainability. Barron et al (2023) argue that such social factors are too often overlooked in analytics, policy dialogue, and the financing of development programs. This partly reflects the limitations and shortcomings of the available data. But there are also methodological difficulties inherent in measuring and unpacking complex social issues, often shaped by long-standing structural factors that interact in intricate ways. Scholars struggle to provide insights as to the strength, dynamics, heterogeneity and causality of these interactions. For example, we know relatively little about the systematic association between social cohesion and resilience, or the extent to which process legitimacy is stronger in contexts with high levels of social inclusion. Another important example: despite many existing theories across disciplines, important questions remain on why people follow social norms, and how new ones are formed (Gross and Vostroknutov, 2021) .",

Low levels of institutional trust in the region are associated with increasing political polarization, unextinguished authoritarian embers, the arbitrary extension of presidential term limits coinciding with corruption-clad short-lived administrations, electoral contestation, frequent attempts at constitutional reforms, misinformation and false news (Keefer and Scartascini 2022). We seek to disentangle how trust in governmental institutions affects people's willingness to participate in political processes, as well as to shed more light on other key factors driving citizen participation. Better understanding of political trust in LAC and how it affects the quality of democracy-captured by strong and meaningful citizen participation-is crucial to understanding how to build more robust democracies with greater political legitimacy (Caceres, 2019; Khan, 2016; Barron et al, 2023) .",

Participation is a form of citizen engagement although it does not cover all possible forms of engagement nor the objectives of that engagement (for example, engagement may simply involve information sharing or building relationships and citizens may seek objectives other than political). In fact, citizen participation, recently defined as a form of social capital (Chetty et al., 2022; Nannicini et al., 2013) , is generally understood as residents' individual and collective efforts to influence community conditions (Adler and Goggin, 2005; Theiss-Morse and Hibbing, 2005) . According to Verba and Nie (1987) , citizen participation can be defined as an activity in which citizens try to influence the government to act in ways that they prefer. These activities are crucial to democracy because they empower citizens to influence the formulation of public policy, and monitor its implementation. Citizen participation also allows government officials to incorporate local expertise into decision-making (Lee and Schachter, 2019; Siebers, Gradus and Grotens, 2019) .",

The World Bank (2013) associates citizen participation with voice, participation, and accountability, and argues that an inclusive society requires institutions, structures, and processes that enable all groups to participate and hold governments accountable. The fact that trust embeds legitimacy into the political system, strengthens democracy, and contributes to increased economic growth-as shown by Zak and Knack, 2001 -may partly explain this increasing attention. Trust in government is one of the most important components in the establishment and long-term viability of political systems (Lee, 2021; Blind, 2007 Blind, , 2010 Hetherington, 2005) and even affects citizens' trust in each other (Holum, 2022; Chanley et al., 2000; Levi and Stoker, 2000) .",

It is worth noting that we are using an umbrella term (\"political\") that combines different kinds of governmental, political and state institutions in which public confidence may and does differ.

        "text": "Two prevailing theories evaluate the link between political trust and citizen participation, but their perspectives differ greatly. On the one hand, the stealth democracy theory posits that trust in government is inversely related to citizen participation. Put another way, citizens only participate when they feel compelled to prevent corrupt politicians from embezzling the public. Individuals' lack of trust in the government may push them to speak out in order to change the behavior of the authorities or replace them. Conversely, people who have confidence in the government see no reason to engage, as they trust those in power to do what is best for society. In sum, trust in government discourages citizen involvement (Hibbing and Theiss-Morse, 2002; Theiss-Morse and Hibbing, 2005; Lee and Schachter, 2019; Lavezzolo and Ramiro, 2018; Muhlberger, 2018) . Deliberative theorists, on the other hand, believe that a trustworthy political system encourages citizens to participate in government processes. If people feel the political system is rigged or uncaring, they are less inclined to engage with it. Apathy stems from a lack of trust, while a responsive government prompts citizen participation (Lee and Schachter, 2019; B\u00e4chtiger et al., 2018; Neblo et al., 2010) . Assessing which (if any) of the two theories most applies to Latin America and the Caribbean is not only an academic exercise but of policy relevance, given that most countries throughout the region display low levels of citizen participation.",

In one recent paper, Lee and Schachter (2019) investigate the relationship between trust in government and citizen participation in the United States using data from the World Values Survey. However, we did not find similar studies across developing countries in general and the LAC region in particular. 2 Hence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about whether the above theories are borne out in the region from existing literature. At the global level, the main relationship investigated is between citizens' trust in government and their willingness to obey laws and pay taxes. There is evidence, though, that weak trust in government can (including in developing-economy settings) erode the social contract and lead to citizens disengaging from the state (that is, citizens evade taxes, stop participating in elections, disobey laws, take justice on their own, among others; see Arizti et al. 2010; Kumagai and Iorio, 2020) .",

Looking beyond linearity and simple relationships imposed by traditional econometric models can provide deeper insights into the complexity of such sociopolitical relationships. More concretely, basic Logit models-used as baseline for our analysis-need to be supplemented by decision trees and regularization methods such as Lasso. These methods are especially useful in predicting whether or not an individual in the Latin America and Caribbean region will participate politically based on her trust in government institutions and socioeconomic characteristics. 4 Traditional Logit models are unable to detect complex nonlinear interactions between independent variables. 5 In order to overcome this limitation, we advance the use of decision tree models, which are especially useful for disentangling complex, nonlinear patterns between explanatory variables that influence the outcome variable. Our key finding is that trust variables predict political participation in non-linear ways. Trust is a significant driver of participation for an individual only after certain levels of education, age, and political interest are combined with experiences of discrimination and violence.",

There are a few notable exceptions, such as El Salvador, where confidence climbed by nearly 60 percentage points (from 12.9 to 72.4 percent), and the Dominican Republic, where trust increased by nearly 25 percentage points (from 28.2 to 52.3 percent) between 2017 and 2020. While confidence levels fell in the majority of LAC countries, they rose in a few exceptions and to different extents. On average, however, the trend for trust in national governments has been declining since 2009, with levels in 2020 almost half of those in 2009. When looking at citizen participation variables, the picture becomes more mixed. Signing a petition is relatively rare in the region, with the regional average standing at 20 percent (see Table 1 above). One outlier is Argentina, where nearly half of individuals say they have ever signed a petition. In Brazil and Uruguay, this percentage likewise approaches 35 percent. Over the last two decades, the proportion of people who have ever signed a petition has stayed below 20 percent, having risen only modestly since 2006. Participation in authorized demonstrations is also relatively uncommon, with the regional average reaching only 15 percent of the population (see Table 1 ). Chile leads in this regard, with almost a third of the population reporting having taken part in legal demonstrations-likely reflecting the mass demonstrations in 2019 and 2020 over the cost of public transport and education as well as economic inequality more broadly. Participation in demonstrations in the region has declined over the past twenty years, coming in line with the global average of 12 percent (Cuesta, Madrigal and Pecorari, 2022) .",

Concretely, having trust in the country's courts increases the odds of participating by 14 percent. This may be the case because the consequences of involvement in community affairs might, in some cases, derive in some level of judicial involvement-be it informal remedial or formal indictment. This type of exposure might not apply to signing petitions or participating in demonstrations. In addition, trust in elections increases the odds of working for a community problem by almost 11 percent. Arguably, if a person believes that a majority decision is legitimately accepted-as it is the case in credible elections-she might be more inclined to believe that outcomes of collective action undertaken to solve community problems will be legitimately accepted. Put differently, more participation might be expected in a context where people consider that their actions are legitimatized, as is the case with trusted (courts and) elections. Middle or old age, better education, being employed, receiving a subsidy, and owning a home all raise the likelihood of working on a community problem. As in the previous models, having an interest in politics, having felt discriminated against, and having been a victim of a crime all increase the likelihood of participating in community affairs. Notably, believing in freedom of speech and having experienced food insecurity both boost the likelihood. Contrary to the previous models, however, belonging to a lower social class marginally decreases the likelihood of working to resolve community problems, which might capture higher opportunity costs of participation among lower income levels. Banerjee and Duflo (2011) have compellingly demonstrated the argument of the poor's higher opportunity costs in terms of investing in education and agricultural technology or deciding on fertility. Moreover, being a man increases the odds of working for community problems by almost 22 percent. These findings may reflect traditionally gendered social norms: both surrounding participation, as well as the need for time and financial resources for engaging in time-consuming activities like resolving community problems. Hence, being a woman and belonging to a low social class both limit the possibility of participation in community affairs. ",

Lasso compares a covariate's contribution to the predictive capacity of the model with the marginal increase in the model's total variance that the covariate produces (see section 2). Given that trust in government has the highest levels of variability when compared to other trust variables, Lasso estimations are more likely to exclude this variable from the model than other types of trust. Also, Lasso estimations select trust in parliament, trust in courts and trust in electoral bodies. However, as was the case in the Logit analysis, such variables are not significant in post-Lasso Logit estimations (see Table 3 ). Lasso estimations in model 2 are consistent with Logit results, picking trust in police as a significant driver of participation in demonstrations. Similarly, in model 3, Lasso estimations align with Logit in selecting trust in courts and trust in electoral bodies as significant drivers.",

This finding has a strong implication when it comes to evaluating the stealth and deliberative democracy theories: it is not possible to conclude in favor of either of them in a systematic way. In other words, neither theory is dominant. Table 4 below maps the results of evaluating both hypotheses, based on the sign and statistical significance of the estimated coefficient between trust in a governmental institution and a specific form of political participation. The Logit model, imposing linear relations across both dimensions, concludes that the stealth democracy theory can be accepted only for trust in national governments when signing a petition and trust in police when participating in demonstrations.

In fact, some of the previously statistically significant trust variables in linear form stop being so in quadratic forms. Lasso does not select any additional quadratic specification of trust and neither do decision trees. Quadratic specification results are available to the reader upon request. Results are less conclusive for these two theories when considering machine learning estimations. For Lasso models, trust in national governments becomes selected out of the model and trust in other governmental institutions are found to be statistically significant drivers of certain types of citizen participation. Thus, deliberative democracy models are passed for trust in courts and involvement in community affairs; and trust in electoral authorities and working towards solving community problems. At the same time, support for the stealth democracy theory is found with regard to trust in police and participating in demonstrations. Decision tree results conclude that neither of the two theories can explain how the link between trust and participation works. This suggests that political trust by itself exerts limited influence on citizen participation. When it does have an effect on participation, it is only after a complex nonlinear combination with other factors. In other words, political trust can be a driver of political participation only when certain other drivers are combined in some specific ways.",

Costs are broadly understood as individual effort, opportunity costs, financial costs, and the possible consequences of participation-such as violent repression, incarceration, stigmatization and so forth-associated with the decision to participate. Signing a petition is a less costly form of participation compared with attending demonstrations or engaging in community problems. Therefore, trust in the national government may only have an effect when it comes to less costly forms of engagement. However, participating in more costly activities, such as demonstrations or community activism, requires additional and comprehensive levels of trust-including in the police and/or courts. This is so because police and courts may be involved in granting permission for a demonstration, ensuring its peaceful occurrence, or deciding on the legal merits of proposed solutions to local problems that are often long-term and entrenched.",

According to this literature, governments make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis. Desired outcomes, such as economic and social stability, legal reforms, and so on, are weighed against the likely costs involved, in the form of political concessions, economic disruptions, and repression and violence. The same is true for citizens: high levels of trust are required to ensure participation in activities with potentially costly consequences. Such activities may include attending a protest or getting involved in community activism. In effect, as our results show, trust in the police, the parliament and the courts do seem to influence more demanding forms of citizen engagement.

Costs cannot be considered in isolation but also against some projected benefits (with reasonable probabilities of occurrence) from the decision to participate.

These results are in line with higher income, age, and education levels linked with more political engagement in the United States. All of this evidence underlines that socioeconomic position remains salient in determining participation, regardless of the type of citizen engagement, levels of interpersonal trust and whether stealth or deliberative democracy theories are accepted. We contend that the stronger the socioeconomic position of the person, the better placed she is to confront the associated (net) costs of participation. Unsurprisingly, a self-reported lower social class-an indication of low socioeconomic status-makes an individual less likely to participate in more costly civic and political activities, namely working on community issues.

Unfortunately, lack of data in the survey used prevents us from including this form of political participation. 21 Based on our findings, we would expect voting to follow a similar pattern to signing a petition given its associated costs. If this prediction is true, voting would be negatively influenced by the level of trust in the incumbent national government and positively driven by trust in electoral authorities.

For example, socioeconomic characteristics such as income, age, or education levels are only relevant if certain conditions are met (e.g., having an interest in politics or having experienced discrimination). Individual characteristics such as internet access, on the other hand, will only play a role after a certain age. From both approaches we conclude that, while governmental trust variables are important, they are not the key drivers of participation. Rather, as decision tree estimation makes clear, having an interest in politics and having felt discriminated against seem to be the ultimate factors driving participation in all three models, together with age, income and education levels. Political trust, on the other hand, only plays a subordinate role on its own. The weak correlations between trust and individual, socioeconomic and perception variables confirm that political trust is not markedly influenced by individual characteristics or circumstances (see table B1 in annex B).",

For example, we have found that trust in the national government decreases participation when it comes to signing a petition. But the same trust does not appear to have any significant effect on the other two types of engagement studied: participating in demonstrations and community activism. This could be partially related to the former requiring less effort and commitment, i.e., bearing a lower financial, economic, and political cost than the latter. As such, we argue that trust in governmental institutions will only play a role in determining citizen participation when the expected net costs of participation are sufficiently low or the goals pursued justify costly levels of engagement. A similar pattern emerges when trust in other governmental institutions is taken into account, such as trust in the police, which significantly influences participation in demonstrations but not the other two types of participation; or trust in the judiciary, which only influences citizen engagement in the form of working to solve community problems. By way of explanation, citizens likely weigh the risk of facing police repression when attending a demonstration, or are discouraged from are evaluating actual rather than intended participation or engagement in an unspecified future.",

Making political institutions more familiar and closer to citizens, reducing the bureaucratic costs of participation, and promoting grassroots organizations all might boost political participation, particularly if aligned with other drivers. These objectives can be realized by facilitating scrutiny and debate over the political process in the media, cultivating an early interest in politics in schools, holding open days across public institutions, ensuring the right to protest safely, lowering the number of signatures required on petitions to elevate issues to authorities, and providing technical support to neighborhood associations, to mention a few. Lesson from Banerjee and Duflo's (2011) small radical thinking to fight global poverty might also be relevant in the context of citizen participation.",

Future research on the linkages between political trust and citizen engagement in the Latin America and the Caribbean region and in other regions should also consider other emerging forms of political engagement like e-participation-that is, online political activity such as, for example, participating in online surveys, using government digital transparency, or adding political banners to profile pictures on Facebook, among others-in addition to voting. It should also more precisely unpack data on different forms of trust, for example in national versus local governments, or across different branches of the police, armed forces, and judiciary. More detailed information is also needed to capture the types of community problems citizens engage or the type of causes that participation in demonstrations are sought to reverse, which are not currently asked in Latinobar\u00f3metro. Future efforts would also benefit from additional investments in quantifying the costs involved in different types of political participation. Flexible models allowing for nonlinearities capturing systems complexity are also needed. All these recommendations, which are reasonably within reach, are needed before more conclusive findings can be drawn as to the relationship between specific forms of citizen participation and specific categories of political trust.

In this work, the Lasso method is used for regularization rather than prediction purposes.5 Logit models can still analyze simple nonlinear relationships by, for example, allowing for quadratic specifications among independent variables.
