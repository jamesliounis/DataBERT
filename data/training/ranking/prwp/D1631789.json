This paper represents a first attempt to fill this gap in the literature. We study the impact of three interlocking contracts on the credit spreads of the project's actively traded global bonds: the 25 year output sales and purchase agreement with Kogas-Kepco, the international bond covenant, and an output price contingent debt service guarantee by Mobil to debtholders. Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, we find that off-taker credit quality and, more importantly, the market's assessment of the output buyer's economic prospects drive project bond credit spreads and the:r pricing. Also, seemingly unrelated events in emerging debt markets spillover to project bond niarkets and affect risk perceptions and prices in this segment. Furthermore, we document how the judicious use of an output price contingent debt service guarantee by shareholders can significantly reduce project risks and that markets reward issuers through tighter credit spreads.",

We show that, in the presence of contractual incompleteness, bondholders and shareholders share residual risks over time in spite of covenants otherwise meant to pre-empt risk shifting. This type of risk shifting originates from incomplete contracts and the non-recourse (stand-alone) feature of project finance. It does not necessarily result from the deliberate attempt by management to pursue high risk, low value activities in order to increase shareholder value at the expense of debtholders (debt agency) although project managers and shareholders could still exploit their informational advantages in leaving output supply contracts incomplete in a manner beneficial to their private interests.",

This financial technique is defined as the raising of funds to finance a single indivisible large-scale capital investment project whose cash flows are the sole source to meet financial obligations and to provide returns to investors. 2 The Ras Gas project has the right to extract, process and sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a field off the shore of Qatar. We study the impact of three interlocking contracts on the credit spreads of the project's actively traded bonds: a 25 year output sales and purchase agreement with a dominant output buyer, the bond covenant, and an output price contingent debt service guarantee by shareholders to debtholders. Such contracts are incomplete by nature in that they could not possibly anticipate all future contingencies, including non-enforceability of liens ' See Zingales (2000) for a discussion of the necessary conditions for a firm's value to be the sum of its contracts. 2 Brealey, Cooper and Habib (1996) contains an excellent survey of the economic issues involved in project finance. Contrary to a large company, projects such Ras Gas have only one cash flow stream to meet all debt obligations and pay dividends. For further discussion of project finance, see Finnerty (1996) . on assets and receivables. In Ras Gas' case, the contractual incompleteness primarily stems from the very specific nature of the required investment in LNG infrastructure (asset specificity), their location, and the long-term nature of the sales contract creating a bilateral monopoly.",

Consequently, we would expect capital markets to price non-contracted risks stemming from the supply contract. Using the structural default rate framework of Madan and Unal (2000) , we analyze the evolution of Ras Gas credit spreads in terms of firm-specific risk variables, in particular the ultimate output buyer's credit spread (the Korea Electric Power Company, Kepco for short). Any material deterioration in the economic prospects of the output buyer, as measured by K.pco's credit spread, should increase the likelihood of breach of contract and, therefore, drive Ras Gas' spreads.

Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, we relate Ras Gas credit spreads to their own lags, to current and lagged Kepco credit spreads, to a crude oil reference price used to settle LNG sales (13rent), Korean control variables, and the current and lagged returns on four regional emerging debt market indices (contagion and spillover effects) in a linear regression framework. We repeat the analysis in a simultaneous equation setting in order to distinguish direct effects of the risk factors from indirect ones operating through the output buyer. This market-based approach to gauging risk perceptions allows us to investigate how the three interlocking contracts allocate project risks between shareholders and debtholders and test for residual risk shifting.",

As Kepco's revenue is almost entirely denominated in Korean Won, any currency depreciation makes USD denominated energy imports more expensive and erodes its financial position, which might call into question contractual commitments. Hence, Ras Gas and its investors bear some Korean currency risk. We also find significant evidence of financial contagion. As returns in European, Middle Eastern and Latin American emerging debt markets fall, we find that Ras Gas spreads are predicted to widen considerably.

        "text": "While the theoretical foundations of project finance have received some attention in the literature (see, e.g., Shah and Thakor, 1987 , Berkovitch and Kim, 1990 , Chemmanur and .lohn, 1996 there are very few empirical studies of project finance. This paper represents a first attempt to fill this gap in the literature. 3 Esty (1999) describes a comparable crude oil project in Venezuela but the existence of a well-developed oil spot market does not lead to a bilateral monopoly with the ensuing contract risk dynamics. Esty and Megginson (2000) , who analyze how political risk shapes the syndication process and pricing of project loans, complement our findings from a private debt perspective. Our analysis is also related to the literature on bond covenants going back to Smith and Warner (1979) . We show that other contractual relationships besides covenants impact bondholders so that one cannot abstract from their contracting and enforcement costs. Furthermore, our results highlight the interdependence of debt finance and risk distribution recently identified in the context of hedging by Mello and Parsons (2000) . This paper also contributes to the nascent empirical literature on structural models of credit spreads. From a methodological point of view, our analysis draws on the theoretical framework of Madan and Unal (2000) whose structural model of the hazard (default) rate implies that credit spreads are linearly related to firm-specific exogenous variables. In contrast to much of the recent theoretical literature (e.g., Duffie and Singleton, 1999) , this approach allows us to cast cash asset value and default risk in terms of the risk factors arising from Ras Gas' contractual structure. As a result, our analysis reconciles continuous time corporate default models with the dominant view of the firm in corporate finance and provides evidence in favor of the Madan and Unal (2000) default risk model. Our main contribution consists in showing how the firm as a nexus of contract allocates contracted and non-contracted risks between different stakeholders and how markets assess the latter in the pricing of financial claims. We show that, in the presence of contractual incompleteness, bondholders and shareholders share residual risks over time in spite of covenants otherwise meant to pre-empt risk shifting. This type of risk shifting originates from incomplete contracts and the non-recourse (stand-alone) feature of project finance. It does not necessarily result from the deliberate attempt by management to pursue high risk, low value activities in order to increase shareholder value at the expense of debtholders 4 (debt agency) although project managers and shareholders could still exploit their informational advantages in leaving output supply contracts incomplete in a manner beneficial to their private interests.",

In light of Ras Gas' output price contingent debt service guarantee, it is intuitive that markets view price risk as secondary to counter-party risk. Only the indirect impact of oil prices acting through the output buyer's credit quality matters to bondholders as rising oil prices adversely affect the former's overall financial position. Similarly, country risk factors affect Ras Gas credit spreads mainly through its impact on the off-taker's perceived riskiness.

The same liquidity effects drive contractual design and risk distribution in projects such as Ras Gas for which hedging opportunities are limited. Hence, another lessons from the Ras Gas project revolves around the strategic use of public debt finance to mitigate liquidity concerns arising from contractual risks over time. We find that, in the absence of appropriate hedging instrumenlts for contractual exposures such as buyer default, output price (revenue) and foreign currency risk, the parties have recourse to contractual provisions and shareholder guarantees albeit at the prize of risk-shifting through non-contractibilities.

Hence, our valuation methods might need to be appended to take into account risk spillovers arising from all contracts, not just the financial arrangements within a firm. Testing for unit roots we use Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests (ADF: correcting for serial correlation in the errors) of the form: Ay, == & + (y -I)y,, +Ay,-, + , where the dependent variable y is either RGS, the spread of the Ras Gas bond over 10 year US Treasury yields, KORELES, the spread of the 2013 7.75% Kepco global bond, or BRENT, the logarithm of the price of Brent oil. Similarly, we appeal to Augmented Engle-Granger tests (AEG) for cointegration because of the presence of serial correlation in the residuals of the cointegration equation. Specifically, we test for unit roots in the residuals drawn from the corresponding cointegration equation, i.e.. y, = f6o + Ax,r + \u00a3r, A\u00a3, = ao + (a-)\u00a3 + A\u00a3,_, + it, The one-sided asymptotic P-values for the zr statistic (both in bold face) under the null hypothesis (existence of unit root or cointegrated time series) are computed by the methods described in MacKinnon (1994) . where the dependent variable RGS is the spread of the Ras Gas bond over 10 year US Treasury yields, BRENT the Brent blend oil price index, KORELES the yield on the 2013 7.75% Kepco global bond, KEPCO the Kepco stock price in logarithms, KRW the Korean Won -USD spot rate in logarithms, KOSPI the Korea Composite Stock Price Index in logarithms, KRR a rating index for Korea, and MEA, ASIA, EUR, LAT the daily returns of the JP Morgan regional total return indices in USD for emerging markets in the Middle East-Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.

To date, Kogas and Kepco have invested about USD lOb in tankers and LNG infrastructure(Standard and Poor's, 1999). 18 Tying transportation capacity to particular projects through the off-take agreements in turn inhibits the emergence of a true spot market. Another problem are the substantial LNG infrastructure investments required on the receiving end that become economically viable only once a source of long-term supply has been secured. The current state of the LNG world market is reminiscent of crude oil trading in the 1950s and 1960s when the solution to hold-up and unilateral renegotiation threats between bilateral monopolists was vertical integration.

At its heart lies the fact that the Kogas off-take agreement effectively collateralizes the project's debt and its cash flow profile. Ras Gas forcefully illustrates the point made in Fama (1990) that a firm's capital structure depends on all contracts with stakeholders, including output purchase agreements and financial guarantees. Since the firm is essentially a web of interlocking contracts, the provisions of the long-term supply contract drive its financi.al structure including the oil price contingent debt service guarantee by shareholders. T he corresponding financial transactions reflect this reality. They attempt to find an optimal balance of the various parties' rights and obligations and serve to allocate risks to the entities best suited to bear them.",
