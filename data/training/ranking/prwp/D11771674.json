        "text": "The crisis has reshaped the global financial landscape: Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, two of the largest US investment banks, merged or filed for bankruptcy. The US government bailed out Citibank and Bank of America, the two largest US banks, and the insurance giant AIG, and put under conservatorship Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, the two largest US mortgage companies. As a result, the traditional model of investment banking that dominated Wall Street during the 20 th century disappeared altogether. Outside the US, many large financial institutions have either experienced large losses or been taken over by their governments, such as BNP Paribas in France, Northern Rock in the UK, UBS in Switzerland, and IKB in Germany, just to name a few. In other countries, like Iceland and Ireland, the whole banking system has been at the verge of collapse and has received massive government bailouts and guarantees. 1 The magnitude and reach of the ongoing financial crisis, several orders of magnitude larger than the size of the initial shock, has led many to wonder how a shock to a seemingly small segment of the US financial market managed to propagate so much, so fast. In fact, by July 2007 most analysts still expected limited consequences from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market because it represented only about 12 percent of the overall US mortgage market, which in turn was only 30 percent of US fixed income markets (Deutsche Bank, 2007) . As frequently mentioned, US stock markets routinely dealt with the expected losses in subprime loans, then valued at about $200 billion. A widespread contagion across asset classes and especially across countries was, by most analysts, considered unlikely. For instance, on May 17, 2007, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, stated: \"We believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will be limited and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.\"",

        "text": "Among possible sources of financial linkages, in addition to common portfolio investors and herding, the worldwide reliance of financial institutions on short-term wholesale funds is a likely major contributor to the spread of the malaise because one of the most outstanding stylized facts about this crisis is the sharp and widespread collapse in liquidity provision (Acharya and Merrouche, 2009; Brunetti et al. 2009) . This collapse took place in two stages: first at the beginning of August 2007, immediately after BNP Paribas ceased redemptions in three of its funds, and second, and most importantly, in mid September 2008, following Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing and the announcement of the US government bailout of AIG. These sharp contractions in liquidity provision have been the focus of recent papers that have proposed explanations based on the interaction between margin calls and market liquidity, the cyclicality of leverage, and the role of Knightian uncertainty (Brunnermeier, 2009; Adrian and Shin, 2009;  and Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2008) . In fact, although the ongoing crisis was initially dubbed the \"subprime crisis\" some authors have started to refer to it as the \"liquidity crunch of 2007-2008\" (Brunnermeier, 2009) .",

Although the earlier literature emphasized the benefits of these alternative sources of financing (Feldman and Schmidt, 2001; Calomiris, 1999) , some voices of concern about the implications of this liability structure for systemic vulnerability have recently been raised. For instance, Rajan (2006) noted that banks' greater reliance on market liquidity makes their balance sheets more suspect in times of crisis. These concerns increased as the ongoing financial crisis started to unfold, and recently various papers and publications have suggested that banks' reliance on wholesale funds may be behind the failure of some institutions.",

However, despite the emphasis put on the use of wholesale funding as a source of propagation of the crisis, and the anecdotal evidence from cases like the one of Northern Rock, there is so far no systematic evidence of its role and its potential to facilitate broad international contagion independently of other real and financial transmission mechanisms.",

        "text": "This paper provides such systematic evidence of the importance of banks' reliance on wholesale funding as a source of vulnerability, and of its contribution to the international transmission of the ongoing financial crisis. It constructs individual bank-level measures of vulnerability to different transmission mechanisms for 662 banks across 44 countries excluding the US, and uses a methodology that combines ingredients from a standard event study with those of differencein-difference estimation for identification. In particular, the paper focuses on the largest liquidity crunch episode of the crisis: the money market freeze following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 (henceforth \"Lehman\"), studies its impact on the stock-price returns of individual banks, and tests whether differences in the abnormal returns observed around those episodes are related to the banks' ex-ante reliance on wholesale funding, as it would be if this reliance contributed to the propagation of the crisis. In addition, the paper checks whether a similar pattern of differential returns is observed after the initial stages of the liquidity crunch that took place on August 9, 2007.",

        "text": "The results show that the banking sector across the world experienced a large and significant abnormal return decline following this event. Banks' returns worldwide declined about 2.9 percent in the three days after Lehman. Furthermore, banks that before the crisis relied more heavily on wholesale funding experienced a larger abnormal return decline in response to US events than other banks. In the days following Lehman, within a country, the returns of banks with high wholesale dependence (75 th percentile) declined 1.6 percent more than those with low wholesale dependence (25 th percentile). This difference is not only large but also statistically significant. Quantitatively, the results show that the use of wholesale funds can explain an important fraction of the early global transmission of this event, confirming that the widespread use of these types of funds played a significant role in the propagation of the financial crisis. A similar but weaker pattern emerges during the early stages of the crisis (August 9, 2007) which confirms the presence of liquidity based transmission but suggests that other factors, such as the exposure of international banks to subprime mortgages, may have initially played a more important role.",

The paper also shows that these results are robust to a battery of changes in the details of the specification and estimation, and to controls for other potential sources of differential effects related to individual banks' riskiness, size, direct exposure to Lehman Brothers, ownership, or specialization. The results also indicate that some country characteristics, such as the coverage of deposit insurance, the amount of international reserves, and the quality of financial regulation, can reduce the vulnerability of wholesale dependent banks to liquidity crunches, while other characteristics such as the degree of financial and banking integration may amplify them. Finally, there is some evidence that the distress caused by Lehman on wholesale dependent banks resulted in a contraction of their lending activity, indicating that this source of vulnerability had consequences for the real economy.",

        "text": "This paper relates to several strands of literature. First, and most directly, it relates to the recent theoretical and empirical literature on the amplification and propagation of the financial crisis. This literature has proposed several mechanisms that may have contributed to spread and amplify the initial shocks. Some papers focus on ultimate mechanisms, such as the presence of Knightian uncertainty among investors that leads them to value returns according to worst case scenarios and withhold liquidity (Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2008) , or the combination of leverage and margin cycles affecting market makers and inducing them to further liquidate assets (Brunnermeier, 2009) . Other papers emphasize proximate causes of the transmission, such as the use of wholesale funds (Shin, 2009) , or the use of pro-cyclical leverage (Adrian and Shin, 2008) . Finally, some recent papers have tried to assess the role of different mechanisms in the transmission of the crisis. Eichengreen et al. (2009) study the role of common factors on the movement of the spreads of the debt of 45 banks in nine developed countries and relate their estimated factors to several potential causes of crisis transmission. They find that the share of variance of bank spreads explained by common factors is typically high and increased during the crisis, suggesting that the forces behind the crisis affect all banks equally, and show that these factors' correlation with measures of banks' credit risk also rises during the crisis. Interestingly, they also find that the share of variation explained by the common factors briefly increased after the failure of Lehman. Tong and Wei (2008) follow a similar approach to this paper, and test whether the crisis spills over to the real economy through reducing consumer demand or tightening liquidity. They look at the stock price response of non-financial firms in the US, between July 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008 , and test whether a firm's sensitivity to consumer demand or financial constraints better explains the cross-section of returns, finding that a firm's degree of financial constraints explains a larger fraction of the stock price declines observed in the US. This paper contributes to this literature by providing systematic evidence of the role of the sources of bank financing in the international transmission of the crisis. In contrast to Eichengreen et al. (2009) , this paper looks at a broad set of banks across a large number of developed and developing countries, and for the most part focuses on differences in returns across individual banks to identify a specific transmission mechanism rather than focusing on common factors and their determinants. This paper shares with Tong and Wei (2008) the use of stock market returns and ex-ante characteristics to identify the role of a transmission mechanism, but it looks at the international transmission of the crisis to the banking sector instead of the transmission to non-financial US industries, and focuses on the stock market responses to a clearly defined episode to identify the mechanism, instead of looking at the longrun performance of stock price returns.",

        "text": "Another recent literature closely related to this paper has focused on the role of interbank markets in the allocation of liquidity during the crisis, and on the appropriate policy interventions in these markets. Motivated by the drying up of interbank markets during the recent crisis and the lack of theoretical foundations for central bank intervention, Allen Carletti and Gale (2008) and Freixas, Martin, and Skeie (2009) present theoretical models of the functioning of interbank markets and derive optimal policies that provide and allocate liquidity among banks. On the empirical side, Brunetti, di Filippo, and Harris (2009) study the impact of central bank intervention on European interbank markets during the crisis using high frequency and find that these interventions seem to have increased the level and volatility of spreads, which they interpret as evidence of a crowding out of private liquidity. Cassola, Hortacsu, and Kastl (2009) use bidding data from the European Central Bank (ECB) auctions for one-week loans to study how the bidding schedule of banks changes during the crisis and how these changes relate to ex-post bank performance. They document that banks bid more aggressively for ECB funds after the beginning of the crisis in August 2007, and that the stock price of banks that were more willing to pay for these funds, those facing higher liquidity costs, performed relatively worse. This paper complements this literature by providing further evidence of the consequences of a drying up of interbank lending markets on banks' performance and lending 6 activities worldwide, thus highlighting the possibility of international contagion and giving further ground for liquidity support by central banks.",

        "text": "The paper also relates to the literature on financial structure and riskiness. Rajan (2006) highlights the risks that the recent process of financial innovation, deregulation, and disintermediation (from banks), creates for the financial system. He argues that the movement of increasing shares of financial transactions to arm's length markets, while beneficial, creates new risks associated with the incentives faced by asset managers. This changing landscape also modifies the behavior and portfolio of banks toward distributing standard risks and warehousing other, more opaque risks, while becoming potentially less able to play their crucial role as liquidity providers in times of distress. The increased reliance of banks on non-deposit sources of funds may further raise the distrust of investors on the liquidity position of banks and undermine their ability to gather spare liquidity. In fact, as shown by Gatev and Strahan (2006) , during the 1998 Russian crisis, investors perceived banks with higher levels of transaction deposits as less risky and channeled large inflows of funds toward them. These banks were, therefore, able to gather and reallocate the scarce liquidity available in the market. This paper provides evidence that the increased reliance of banks on wholesale sources of funds, while reducing their dependence on retail deposits, increases their vulnerability to shocks to the money market, and reduces their ability to intermediate the remaining liquid funds.",

In addition to the common portfolio positions highlighted by the models following the Asian and Russian crises (Calvo, 1998; Calvo and Mendoza, 2000; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 2000; Kaminsky and Schmukler; 1999) , the evidence shows that the development of international money markets may help spread financial malaise by globally spreading the impact of money market shocks. The contagion does not only come from a country-specific shock that propagates to countries financially linked to the affected one, but also from a common shock that affects those countries that are structurally exposed to it. Furthermore, the evidence in this paper is robust to the standard criticism that it is difficult to separate trade links and financial links at the aggregate level to determine the channels of contagion. This is because the identification comes mainly from within country differences in returns across banks, so it controls for country level differences in exposure through trade linkages.",

For instance, the gross amount of deposits from foreign banks has increased from 6,240 to 13,856 billion US dollars between 2001 and 2006 among the 41 countries surveyed by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS, 2008) . This increased reliance on wholesale funds can also be seen in bank-level data from Bankscope that show an increase in the use of wholesale sources of funds in the 5 years preceding the beginning of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Across all banks located in the 44 countries covered by Bankscope that have an FTSE financial sector index (which will constitute this paper's sample, as explained below), the average fraction of liabilities that do not correspond to deposits increased in around 60 percent between the end of 2001 and 2006. The increases are larger among commercial banks, reaching about 80 percent. This is shown in Figure 1 Despite the potential advantages of a broad base of funding, and the apparent fragility of demand deposits, it has been recently recognized that wholesale funds are more volatile than demand deposits-probably because they are typically uninsured, and put banks at risk of liquidity dry-ups (Rajan, 2006) , such as those occurring during the ongoing financial crisis. This has led some authors to suggest that the reliance of some banks on these sources of funds can explain the demise of some financial institutions and part of the crisis depth (Shin, 2008) .",

In fact, the difference in abnormal returns between banks with high and low wholesale dependence is significantly larger at the 5 percent level (in absolute value) immediately after Lehman than before it.

This magnitude is large in absolute terms and also compared to the 3.3 percent decline relative to pre-event trend documented for the whole banking sector in Panel B of The previous results come from a one-factor model that only controls for market returns. This simple model has the advantage of permitting the interpretation of the 0,\uf074 \uf064 coefficients as the average abnormal returns of the whole banking sector relative to the market, but does not control for the overall banking sector performance when computing the differential returns (CADR). Therefore, it is possible that country level differences in bank sector performance drive the results. This may still be consistent with the hypothesis of liquidity driven transmission, but",

First, the liquidity crunch in August 2007 was smaller and slower than in the second half of September 2008 (only 0.4 percent increase in the TED spread three days after the event, compared to 1.6 percent during Lehman). Second, the August 2007 liquidity crunch affected a segment of wholesale funds (ABCP) that were heavily used by some financial institutions (SVP and conduits) linked to banks, but less so for commercial banks themselves. This may have delayed the response of bank returns to the shock to the ABCP market until market participants fully realized the connections between conduits and banks and the former had to tap into the credit guaranteed offered by the latter. In contrast, following the Lehman episode, the complete interbank market came to a standstill in a situation where alternative sources of funding, such as ABCPs had already dried. Third, the August 2007 episode occurred at the beginning of the crisis, when still most analysts and publications referred to the turbulences as the \"subprime crisis\" and the extent of contagion to other financial segments was still unclear. Thus, the transmission mechanism at that stage of the crisis was probably more closely linked to the exposure of banks to \"toxic\" assets than to their reliance on international liquidity markets.",

Figure 8 reports the evolution of the cumulative differential returns 1, \uf074 \uf064 in these two episodes. It clearly shows that there is no obvious differential return response of banks with high wholesale dependence in any direction (positive or negative) in each of these episodes. None of the estimated differential abnormal returns is statistically different from zero in the days immediately after the event. In the Bear Stearns' collapse, the only significant differential return occurs eight days after the event, and in the case of the bailout, it occurs 10 days after.

The main advantage of looking at stock prices in an eventful period such as the 2007/2008 crisis is that this approach focuses on high frequency responses and isolates the impact of an event within a narrow window where one can safely assume that the event is the main news. Studying lower frequency data runs the risk of confounding the impact of the events with the policy responses they triggered such as the massive interventions by the Federal Reserve, the ECB, or the US and other governments. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it only shows the impact of the events on the financial value of banks but not the second round impact it has on the real economy. It is thus possible to wonder whether the mechanism reported here matters for real production decisions. The regressions reported in Table 2 \uf02d is the log assets of the bank immediately before the Lehman event. The parameters to be estimated are c \uf061 (country fixed effects), \uf062 , and \uf067 .

This measure has the advantage of being as close as possible to the theoretically correct measure without sacrificing much coverage.

Nevertheless, there are alternative measures that capture somewhat different aspects of a bank's reliance on wholesale funds without sacrificing much sample coverage, or even increasing it. The results reported in panels C and D explore two of such possibilities. Panel C reports the CADR obtained using the simplest possible measure: the ratio of deposits to liabilities. The difference with the baseline measure is, of course, that it does not discount bank deposits from the numerator. This measure indeed increases the sample size from 662 to 772 observations. The results are similar to the baseline. The overall CADR decline is slightly smaller, but it starts from a pre-event level of almost zero, so the differential CADR relative to the pre-event period is very similar to that obtained in the baseline results. The statistical significance of the results is also largely unaffected. Using the ratio of retail deposits to loans yields similar results (Panel D). This measure captures the fraction of a bank's illiquid assets that are committed to demand deposits, so it is not only a measure of wholesale dependence but also of illiquidity. As before, the figure exhibits a significant and persistent decline in CADR after the event that reaches 1.5 percent three days after the event. 13",

In contrast, the baseline results of this paper come from parameters estimated long before the event, because despite the time gap, those observations are more likely to capture accurately the statistical relations among variables during normal times. Nevertheless, I also constructed the abnormal returns using parameters estimated immediately before the event window to check for the relevance of this choice for the main findings of the paper. Panel A of Appendix Figure 1 reports the results, which are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the baseline, although the decline in CADR is slightly smaller (reaching 2 percent three days after the event) and the statistical significance of the results is marginally reduced.Including only countries with FTSE banking sector indexes in the sample ensures that in each country there are at least some banks with non-trivial market capitalization and shares' turnover. However, not all the banks included trade frequently, especially during turbulent times. Since the calculation of the stock market returns used in the baseline estimations did not correct for thinly traded stocks, the parameters may be biased, and the abnormal returns may exhibit excessive volatility.

The results reported in Panel A of Figure 13 allow the differential effect of the event to depend on a country's degree of capital account openness (captured by the Ito and Chinn, 2008 index). Wholesale dependent banks located in more financially open countries experience a similar decline than those in less open countries. Only four days after the Lehman event (September 19) there is a significantly larger relative decline in more open countries. A possible explanation for this lack of relevance of capital account openness in the transmission of the crisis is that the relevant measure of openness should more directly capture the exposure of the banking sector to international sources of wholesale funds. Since there are no bank level data on the use of international funds, I rely instead on data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) on the external deposits and loans of banks in a country vis-\u00e0-vis the foreign bank and non-bank sector. The evidence, shown in panels B.1 and B.2, supports this idea. The CADR of high wholesale dependence banks in countries with external loans as a fraction of totalbank assets below the cross-country median is much smaller than that of countries above the median. The exposure of the banking sector seems to matter. Overall, it seems that the liquidity crunch was particularly important for banks with high wholesale dependence located in countries with good banking sector integration. This further supports the role of wholesale dependence as a source of vulnerability that contributes to the transmission of money market shocks.",

East Asia and Pacific overtakes Western Europe, with 234 and 231 banks, respectively; South Asia surpasses the remaining of the fraction of non-deposit liabilities.
