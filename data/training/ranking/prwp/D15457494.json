These trends had positive economic benefits and have led to increased productivity, increased capital flows, lower borrowing costs, and better price discovery and risk diversification. But the same trends have also led to greater linkages across financial institutions around the world as well as an increase in exposure of these institutions to common sources of risk. The recent financial crisis has demonstrated that financial institutions around the world are highly inter-connected and that vulnerabilities in one market can easily spread to other markets outside of national boundaries.",

The growing expansion of financial institutions beyond national boundaries over the past decade has resulted in these institutions competing in increasingly similar markets, exposing them to common sources of market and credit risk. During the same period, rapid development of new financial instruments has created new channels of inter-dependency across these institutions. Both increased interconnections and common exposure to risk makes the banking sector more vulnerable to economic, liquidity and information shocks. There is substantial theoretical literature that models the various channels through which such shocks can culminate in a systemic banking crisis (see for instance Bhattacharya and Gale 1987 , Allen and Gale 2000 , Diamond and Rajan 2005 ; and focusing on the recent crisis, , Danielsson, Shin, and Zigrand 2009 , Battiston et al. 2009 To examine whether the global banking sector has become more interdependent and more fragile to shocks, we construct a default risk measure for all publicly traded banks using the Merton (1974) contingent claim model. We compute weekly time series of default probabilities for over 1,800 banks in over 60 countries and examine the evolution of the correlation structure of default risk over the 1998 -2010 time period.",

Although we observe an overall trend towards convergence in default risk globally, this trend has been much stronger for North American and European banks. We also find that increase in co-dependence has been higher for banks that are larger (with greater than 50 billion in assets). We also examine variation in codependence across countries. We find that countries that are more integrated, have liberalized financial systems and weak banking supervision have higher co-dependence in their banking sector.",

In the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis of 2007/08, there has been renewed interest in macro-prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system. There has also been a growing consensus to adjust capital requirements to better reflect an individual bank\"s contribution to the risk of the financial system as a whole (Brunnermeier, Crockett, Goodhart, Persaud, and Shin 2009 , Financial Stability Forum 2009a , 2009b . Recently a number of papers have tried to measure and quantify systemic risk inherent in the global banking sector. Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) , Huang, Zhou, and Zhou (2009) , Chan-Lau and Gravelle (2005), Avesani et al. (2006), and Elsinger and Lehar (2008) , use a portfolio credit risk approach to compute the contribution of an individual bank to the risk of a portfolio of banks. Our paper is related to this strand of literature, but our focus is not on quantifying systemic risk of large financial institutions but rather to examine time series trends for a large cross-section of banks.",

De Nicolo and Kwast (2002) find rising correlations between bank stock returns in the U. S. from 1988 S. from and 1999 S. from . Schuler (2002 find similar results for Europe using a sample from 1980 to 2001. Hawkesby, Marsh and Stevens (2005) analyze co-movements in equity returns for a set of US and European large complex financial institutions using several statistical techniques and find a high degree of commonality. This paper is also related to the literature that studies contagion in financial markets (see among others Forbes and Rigobon 2002, Kee-Hong Bae and Stulz 2003) and also the literature that examines the impact of globalization on convergence of asset prices (Bekeart and Wang 2009 , Longin and Solnik 1995 , Bekaert and Harvey 2000 , and Bekaert, Hodrick and Zhang 2009 . This paper differs from the existing literature in three respects. First, our empirical analyses cast a wider net than the existing literature which focuses only in a particular region or a country and covers a shorter time period. Second we examine time series trends in codependence and test for structural changes over time. Finally, we examine cross-country differences in co-dependence and link the differences to measures of financial and economic openness and regulatory frameworks in different countries.",

We use weekly market data and annual accounting information in creating our credit risk measure. All data items are in US dollars to make comparisons across countries possible. We compute default probabilities implied from the structural credit risk model of Merton (1974) . This approach treats the equity value of a company as a call option on the company\"s assets. The probability of default is computed using the \"distance-to-default\" measure, which is the difference between the asset value of the firm and the face value of its debt, scaled by the standard deviation of the firm\"s asset value. The Merton (1974) distance-todefault measure has been shown to be good predictor of defaults outperforming accountingbased models (Campbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi 2008; Hillegeist, Keating, Cram, and Lundstedt, 2004; Bharath and Shumway, 2008) . Although the Merton distance-to-default measure is more commonly used in bankruptcy prediction in the corporate sector, Merton (1977) points out the applicability of the contingent claims approach to pricing deposit insurance in the banking context. Bongini, Laeven, and Majnoni (2002) , Bartram, Brown and Hundt (2008) and others have used the Merton model to measure default probabilities of commercial banks.",

The results are reported in To explore further the systematic variation in changes in bank default risk, we follow the methodology of Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) and decompose changes in default risk into three components: global effect, country effects and asset size effects. The rationale for including asset size is the substantial increase in bank size and concentration over the sample period we study (Demirguc-Kunt and Huizianga 2010). The larger banks tend operate beyond national borders and compete in similar markets and activities. As larger banks tend to engage in risk-transfer with other banks of similar size, they share many linkages and are exposed to significant counter-party risk. For these reasons there maybe commonality in default risk in larger banks distinct from the rest of the banking sector. Following Demirguc-Kunt and Huizianga (2010), we classify banks into three size categories: banks with assets less than 10 billion, assets between 10 to 50 billion and assets greater than 50 billion.

We compute weekly changes in default probabilities based on the Merton (1974) model for over 1,800 banks in over 70 countries. We show that systematic default risk has a significant global component in the banking sector accounting for 20% of the 15 systematic variation. During the global financial crisis, there has been a uniform increase in codependence across all countries. However, we do find cross-sectional differences in the magnitude of the increase across different countries. We also find that there has been a significant increase in default risk co-dependence over the three year period leading up to the financial crisis. During this time period we find even greater cross-country variation, with banks located in the developed countries (and especially banks located in the US and the European Union) seeing an increase co-dependence while banks located in developing countries seeing a decrease. Examining the 1998-2010 time period, we find that countries which are more integrated, and which have liberalized financial systems and weak banking supervision and greater safety net coverage also have higher co-dependence in their banking sector. The results in this paper have important policy implications.

The principal component analyses results suggest that there is a significant amount of commonality in the variation of default risk changes. Furthermore, the first principal component consists of a roughly uniform weighting of default risk changes for countries in our sample. The first principal component, thus, resembles a global factor affecting the default risk changes of all banks. Consistent with this result we observe significant clustering of changes in bank default probabilities. Figure 5 shows the percentage of banks that had their worst change in default risk in the same week over a 12 month time period. If the changes in credit risk are independent we would expect to see an even distribution of worst changes in default risk for banks over time. In other words we would expect to see a flat line with no spikes. Instead, we see significant clustering. The extent of clustering during the recent financial crisis is especially dramatic.",

Few weeks later, BNP ceased redemptions in three of its funds due to \"complete evaporation of liquidity\" in the markets. 3 January 2004 to June 2007 is the period leading up the subprime crisis. It was around the beginning of 2004 when there began a substantial increase in subprime lending, growth of so-called shadow banking(Gorton 2011), increase in leverage of major financial institutions and reliance in short-term borrowing Shin 2011, Morris   and as well as increase in global imbalances(Jagannathan, Kapoor and Schaumburg   2009) that culminated in a crisis starting the summer of 2007.",

Results under models 6 and 7 show that reforms that have led to international capital liberalization and stock market liberalization have increased co-dependence. Reforms that have led to stronger bank supervision, however, have decreased co-dependence (model 8). We also examine the impact of bank concentration as measured by assets of 3 largest banks as a share of assets of all commercial banks. As mentioned earlier, there has been a substantial increase in concentration in both developing and developed countries. As the recent crisis has demonstrated, large complex financial institutions can cause systemic disruptions affecting all other financial institutions. We find concentration to increase co-dependence. This is in contrast toBeck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2006) who    show that countries with a more concentrated banking system are less likely to suffer a systemic banking crisis. Finally, we examine the impact of moral hazard on co-dependence. If there is an implicit guarantee provided by the State to cover losses stemming from a systemic crisis, banks will have incentives to take on correlated risks (Acharya 2005). Guaranteed banks will not have incentives to diversify their operations, since the guarantee takes effect only if other banks fail as",
