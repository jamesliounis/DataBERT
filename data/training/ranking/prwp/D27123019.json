This paper investigates whether the country will be able to maintain such high levels of growth going forward. A simple growth model calibrated to the Bangladesh economy is used to analyze various growth scenarios. The main finding of the paper is that it is crucial for the country to focus on reforms to raise total factor productivity (TFP) growth, to sustain the high real GDP growth seen in the recent past. The country will fail to achieve high growth in absence of strong TFP growth despite meeting the levels of investment as outlined in the Seventh Five Year Plan. The model is also used to gain insights on government debt sustainability given different growth scenarios. The analysis highlights the significance of meeting revenue targets in maintaining sustainability, considering the planned expansion in expenditures.",

Additionally, the economy has seen a long-term acceleration in growth since the late 1970s when the real GDP was growing by just over 4 percent annually. The acceleration in real GDP growth has also translated to an acceleration in real GDP per capita growth as the gap between real GDP growth and population has been widening over time. 2 Beginning from $352 in 1980, real GDP per capita (measured in 2010 US dollars) crossed $700 in 2008 and is on mark to cross $1,000 next year. The sustained economic growth during the last few decades has helped the country graduate from a low-income country to a lower-middle-income country as classified by the World Bank (World Bank, 2015).",

On the other hand, India and China, which also realized healthy economic growth during the same period, were aided significantly by productivity with TFP growing by 1.3 percent and 2.9 percent on average each year respectively. However, the uptick in TFP growth since later 2000s is encouraging and continued reforms can help the country to move into an era of sustained positive TFP growth.",

The goal is to identify areas that need reform and quantify the relative merit of alternative growth strategies. Such an analysis will help isolate factors that are most likely to be the key drivers of growth. In this paper, I use the World Bank's Long-Term Growth Model (LTGM) to answer these questions. The LTGM (Pennings 2016 ) is a simple 3 The estimated TFP growth series is usually volatile and is also sensitive to the method of estimation. TFP is estimated as a residual after accounting for all factors of production, and the estimates across studies are bound to differ if they employ a different production function or measure factors of production differently. For example, estimates of TFP will be different for a study that accounts for human capital based on schooling compared to a study that does not account for human capital gains that stem from schooling. Swan (1956) growth models, and uses investment, savings and productivity as building blocks and ties these variables to economic growth. The model also includes labor market forces that are important in driving growth together with an external sector through which additional investment can be sourced. An important finding from the growth equation obtained after solving the model shows that investment becomes less effective in generating growth with an increase in the capital-tooutput ratio. This implies that the same level of investment share of output will generate lower growth if capital in the economy is growing faster than output. Hence, an investment-led growth strategy in absence of reforms that focus on growth of productivity, human capital and participation will eventually run out of steam.",

An investment-led strategy that boosts investment share to 35 percent by 2020 coupled with improvements in efficiency of public capital will deliver GDP growth of 5 percent for the next decade. However, maintaining such level of investment will deliver lower than 5 percent GDP growth beyond 2025 in absence of TFP growth as high capital-to-output ratio will make investment less-and-less productive in generating growth. Alternatively, a sustained high GDP growth path in absence of TFP growth will require massive investments that exceed the levels targeted by the government. More alarmingly, the required investments will soon reach levels that are unrealistic to attain. Finally, the model can also be used to infer what the implied growth paths spell for the sustainability of government debt position. The country has a low government debt to GDP ratio which stood at 34 percent at the end of 2015. The analysis finds that the government debt situation is sensitive to government operations and that meeting tax revenue targets is essential to keep the government debt to GDP ratio in check. The government debt sustainability will face additional risk if the government overshoots its expenditure without making much progress on the revenue front.",

First, the TFP growth has the largest direct effect on growth where a 1 percentage point increase in TFP leads to a 1 percentage point increase in growth rate of output per capita. Second, the production function parameter plays an important role in determining the relative importance of capital and labor growth in driving aggregate growth. The larger the labor share of income, the more responsive is the output growth to increases in participation rate, working age population to population ratio and human capital per worker. Conversely, the larger the labor share of income, lower the effect of capital accumulation in generating growth. Finally, it is important to note that keeping all else constant, the same level of investment share of output can lead to different output growth rates depending on the level of the capital-tooutput ratio of the economy. Investment becomes less effective as the capital-to-output ratio rises in the economy. This implies that the same level of investment share of output will generate lower growth if capital in the economy grows faster than the output. Hence, an investment led growth strategy in absence of reforms that focus on growth of productivity, human capital and participation will eventually run out of steam.",

To capture the differences in efficiency across public and private investment, it is assumed that a unit of public investment equals only a fraction \u2208 0,1 of private investment which is perfectly efficient.

In line with the plan targets, the desired GDP growth rate increases steady from 7 percent in 2016 to reach 8 percent by 2020. The desired GDP growth path remains at 8 percent from then onward. Like in the previous exercise, four different growth scenarios are considered: \uf0b7 Baseline Scenario: All variables, for example growth rate of human capital per worker, follow the same path as in the Baseline Scenario of the previous exercise. Note that the investment share of GDP which was an input in the previous exercise is the output of this exercise. \uf0b7 Participation Scenario: Except female labor force participation rate, all other variables follow the same path as in Baseline Scenario. The female labor force participation rate grows linearly from 34 percent in 2015 to 45 percent in 2020. \uf0b7 High Growth Scenario I: Except TFP growth, all other variables follow the same path as in Participation Scenario. TFP grows by 1.0 percent each year. \uf0b7 High Growth Scenario II: Except TFP growth, all other variables follow the same path as in Participation Scenario. TFP grows by 1.5 percent each year. The results of the simulation are shown in the following figures. Barring demographic changes, the only driver of growth operating in the Baseline Scenario is the growth of human capital per worker. The previous exercise showed that the 7 th Five Year Plan targets will fail to deliver planned GDP growth under Baseline Scenario. Not surprisingly, the figure below shows that required investment share of GDP that delivers planned growth overshoots planned investment. However, the more important finding is the stark gap in required investment and planned investment. The required investment share of GDP exceeds the planned investment share by more than 13 percentage points in 2016 and rises steadily to cross 25 percent by 2020. The required investment share rises fast over time and reaches unfeasible levels soon and reaches almost 65 percent by 2022. The gap between required investment and planned investment is somewhat lower under Participation Scenario as steady increases in female labor force participation rate share the burden of delivering high desired growth. Yet, the require investment share of GDP exceeds the planned investment share significantly and the gap between the two cross the 20 percent mark in 2020. Though lower than the required investment share in the Baseline Scenario, the investment share under Participation Scenario also reaches unfeasible levels soon enough and crosses the 65 percent mark in 2024. These results suggest that targeting sustainable GDP growth rates in the 7 -8 percent range via boosting investment without TFP growth is bound to result in disappointment.",

In fact, barring the last plan year the planned investment share exceeds or remains close to the required investment share. The growth of required investment share is muted in presence of TFP growth compared to the earlier two scenarios as TFP growth keeps capital to output ratio low thereby maintaining the productivity of expanding capital stock.

In order to test the sensitivity of the main results of the model, I repeat the quantitative exercises with a higher value of labor share of income. The chosen higher value of the labor share -55 percent, roughly corresponds to the mean labor share of lower-middle income countries. In addition, I also consider two other extreme values of labor share of income -30 percent and 60 percent, to arrive at a broader range of results.",

Equation (8) helps in understanding why this happens. The labor share of income determines the relative impact of factors pertaining to labor accumulation with respect to factor pertaining to capital accumulation. A higher value of labor share increases the growth impact from the former, for example growth generated from increasing participation rates while decreases the growth impact of investment. To the extent that the growth impact from capital accumulation is stronger than the growth impact from labor accumulation, an increase in labor share puts downward pressure on implied growth. It is precisely due to this reason that the aggregate growth increases across scenarios when a lower labor share is used, and vice versa. There is some variation in growth rates when the extremely lower labor share of 30 percent is used. The difference in the growth rates across two specifications is particularly large for the later years. The average growth rate under High Growth II scenario with the lower labor share of 30 percent is more than 1.5 percentage points higher than the benchmark specification for the 2021 -2025 period and is around 2 percentage points higher for the 2025 -2030 period. However, the average growth rate does not decline significantly with the alternative higher values of labor share considered which lie closer to the labor share used in the benchmark exercises and the difference in averages across five year periods across the two specifications stays within 70 basis points.",

To test the sensitivity of the results, the exercises are repeated using a higher depreciation rate of 4 percent.
