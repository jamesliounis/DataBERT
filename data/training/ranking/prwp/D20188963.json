        "text": "This paper analyzes the level and trends in inequality of opportunity among Egyptian children during the 2000s. The analysis uses severall tools, including comparison of the distributions of early risks and outcomes across circumstance groups; estimation of the human opportunity index; measurement of the relative contributions of circumstances to inequality of opportunity; and decomposition of changes in inequality of opportunity and factors driving them over time. Egypt has made significant progress in the availability of and access to basic services for children and mothers, in some cases with an overall pro-poor effect. In particular, appreciable improvements have been made in healthcare utilization before and during pregnancy and immunizations. As a result, there has been a decline in inequality of opportunity over the past decade, largely attributable to increased coverage by basic services rather than through redistributive effects. However, there are areas of persistent and emerging concerns, including postnatal care utilization, nutrition, and schooling. Nutrition indicators have deteriorated during the 2000s, affecting a quarter of children regardless of their circumstances. Wide disparities in school enrollment persist, notably at the higher levels. Large regional disparities in access to basic infrastructure exist, with Upper Egypt and the Frontier Governorates lagging the rest of the country. Family background, especially parents' education and wealth, and geographic factors are key factors affecting child development outcomes in Egypt. While interventions targeted at the less advantaged circumstance groups may offer significant potential for enhancing overall equity in postnatal care utilization and schooling, a more inclusive approach would be needed to improve child nutrition outcomes.",

They are typically higher in earlier stages of life, with important long-term and sometimes irreversible consequences. In Egypt, as elsewhere, many of the critical inputs for early childhood development, such as the quantity and quality of food, early education and healthcare, and the availability of clean water and sanitation, are unequally distributed among children. For instance, Egypt's children and youth, representing more than one-third of the country\u00b4s population, face a higher risk of poverty than the general population; and the gap has widened during the past decade (World Bank, 2011). The unequal distribution of these factors contributes in turn to inequality in desirable early childhood development outcomes, and, as such, represents an important source of inequality later in life.",

Longitudinal studies show that investments in children from poor and vulnerable families can translate into higher earnings in adulthood, thus helping break the cycle of poverty. Nationally, more equitable access to basic services in the early years could lead to more human capital accumulation, which in turn could translate into higher economic growth (see Galor and Zeira, 1993 for theoretical evidence; Birdsall and Londono 1997 and Lo\u00c2pez et al., 1998 for empirical evidence). While the acceptable level of inequality of outcomes (such as income) in a society is debatable, policies to give all children equal opportunity, regardless of their socioeconomic background, are embraced across the political spectrum. Early childhood development interventions are thus generally considered as some of the few policy areas where the traditional equity-efficiency trade-off does not exist (Heckman and Masterov 2007) . It is therefore important to understand how children's opportunities develop and identify policy interventions that contribute to reducing the impact of predetermined factors.",

Specifically, the paper aims to answer a simple question: what are the chances that an Egyptian child will have adequate access to critical basic services regardless of his or her circumstances at birth, such as gender, place of birth, and family background? It draws on the concepts and ideas developed in the World Development Report (WDR) 2006: Equity and Development, WDR 2007: Development and the Next Generation, and the methodology developed in the recent and growing literature on inequality of opportunity (see, for example, John Roemer, 1998; Barros et al., 2009) . The study follows a life cycle approach that identifies an individual's outcomes and opportunities from conception to adulthood and analyzes the extent to which these outcomes are determined by circumstances beyond individuals\u00b4 control. We use data from Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey (HIECS) over time. 1",

Imagine Amal, a six-year-old girl living in rural Suhag (in Upper Egypt), one of the poorest governorates. Amal has four siblings and lives with her widowed mother who has no formal education and works in subsistence agriculture. Now in turn imagine Karim, a boy, also six years old, living in Heliopolis, an upscale neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt's largest megacity. Karim has one sibling and lives with his mother and father, both graduates from the American University of Cairo. Karim's father works for a multinational corporation and his mother in the Egyptian civil service. What are the chances that both Amal and Karim will have access to basic services and early childhood development interventions that will have profound impact on their long term educational, health and labor market outcomes? The paper analyzes the difficulties faced by children like Amal due to circumstances beyond their control, such as their gender, place of birth, and family background. It presents empirical evidence on the levels and trends in inequality in access to basic services among children and the resulting inequality in development outcomes early in life.",

In a study investigating the correlation between socioeconomic status and malnutrition among children under the age of 5 in South Africa, Zere and McIntyre (2003) analyzed household income and expenditure survey data and found that stunting and wasting were most highly concentrated in the poorest regions of the country. The study found wasting and stunting to be phenomena the poor suffered from the most. It also highlighted that inequality was highest along racial lines: among the white population, no significant inequities were observed, while nonwhite children from metropolitan areas displayed the highest levels of stunting. A similar study undertaken in Brazil analyzed the prevalence of child malnutrition in relation with income and basic services redistribution policies (Monteiro et al. 2009) . The study found that over the 33 years examined, the gap between children from poor and rich households in terms of stunting had narrowed significantly along with shrinking inequality in income distribution, a rise in purchasing power, and increase in access to healthcare and other basic services among the poor. Burgard (2002) also measures inequality of opportunities with a special focus on racial inequalities in child stunting in Brazil and South Africa. The paper finds that racial differences and household socioeconomic status are strongly correlated with stunting.",

Circumstances, such as those listed above, should be morally irrelevant and should not matter.

The utilization of healthcare services during birth has similarly improved, with increases in coverage and reductions in the dissimilarity index.

Figure 11 presents the decomposition of the changes in HOI into scale and distribution effects. As shown earlier, the HOI for all healthcare utilization indicators has increased, and the scale effect (the increases in coverage of services) has been the major source of the improvement. For instance, the HOI for the indicator on births taking place at a health facility that increased from 38 to 63 between 2000 and 2008, around 18 percentage points of the increase can be attributed to the scale effect (services becoming more widely available and being utilized), while about 8 percentage points is attributable to the distribution effect (services becoming more equitably available across circumstance groups).

However, disparities still remain across circumstance groups, particularly by location, with rural Upper Egypt and the Frontier Governorates generally showing lower levels of HOI for all categories. Regional variables mostly explain the variation in access to improved water at home and whether the child is registered, while wealth is the main explanatory factor of the differences in access to a non-shared toilet and electricity at home. The Shapley decomposition reveals that regional variables explain the largest share of the variations in access to improved water at home and in whether the child is registered. In fact, regional variables explain more than half of the variation in access to improved drinking water at home and about a third of the variation in whether the child is registered (Figure 15) . For access to a non-shared toilet and electricity at home, the asset index of the household is the main indicator that explains variation in outcomes. degree of inequality of opportunity is higher than at the basic education level, as shown by a higher dissimilarity index. Inequality of opportunity in enrollment for both age groups varies significantly by region, although the disparities have declined over time. For example, in 2000, rural Upper Egypt presented the lowest HOI at about 76 percent and 48 percent for 6-14 and 17-17 age groups respectively. On the other hand, urban Lower Egypt had the highest HOI at about 92 and 75 percent for 6-14 and 17-17 age groups. Similar improvements can be noticed in 6 th and 9 th grade on-time completion rates. On time completion of 6 th and 9 th grade rates show similar improvements over the period, although the HOI for both is lower than that of enrollment ( Figure 16 ). The changes in HOI in the education sector are mostly a result of the expansion of coverage for children overall (the scale effect) rather than the distribution effect. Inequality of opportunity in enrollment for both age groups varies significantly by region. enrolled for children ( Figure 17) . Similarly, these variables explain more than half of the variation in the probability of completion of 6 th and 9 th grades on time. Following parental education variables, the asset index and consumption level of the household together explain about one-fourth of the variation in educational enrollment. Regional variables, on the other hand explain less than 10 percent of the variation in enrollment rates in Egypt. ",

Normally, W/H is used as an indicator of current nutritional status and can be useful for screening children at risk and for measuring short-term changes in nutritional status. At the other end of the spectrum, W/H can also be used to construct indicators of obesity. Low W/H relative to a child of the same sex and age in a reference population is referred to as \"thinness.\" Extreme cases of low W/H are commonly referred to as \"wasting.\" Wasting may be the consequence of starvation or severe disease (in particular, diarrhea) (World Bank 2008). 4 Weight-for-age (W/A) reflects body mass relative to age. W/A is, in effect, a composite measure of height-for-age and weight-forheight, the term \"underweight\" is commonly used to refer to severe or pathological deficits in W/A.

The procedure allows us to measure how much individual circumstances (such as gender, location, parental characteristics) contribute to inequality in access to critical services. Shapely decomposition consists of computing the marginal effect on the inequality index, in this case HOI, of adding or removing each contributing factor in a given sequence of elimination(Betti and Lemmi 2008;Shorrocks 2012). The decomposition involves calculating the marginal impact of each of the circumstances as they are eliminated in succession, and then averaging these marginal effects over all the possible elimination sequences. The contribution of all circumstances yields an exact, additive decomposition of between group inequalities (in this case the dissimilarity index). The resulting formula is formally identical to the Shapley Value in a cooperative game.6"

For instance, about 70 percent of births in the poorest quintile took place without trained staff and 79 percent of births took place outside of health facilities in 2000. By 2008, these levels had declined to about 46 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Regional disparities also diminished with increased availability of care in rural areas. While in 2000 about 52 percent of births in rural areas took place without skilled health staff, this level had declined to 28 percent by 2008 (Figure 2). However, births assisted by traditional birth attendants were still the most common phenomenon among the poorest. In the poorest quintile, traditional birth attendants assisted 42 percent of all births for children in 2008 (Figure 3). Births in rural areas, Upper Egypt and Frontier Governorates remained much more likely to be unattended by skilled health professionals. Wealth and mother's educational attainment are the most significant correlates of not having access to care during birth. Mothers with no formal education were 13 times more likely to have birth not attended by skilled staff, compared to those with a university degree. Moreover, the majority of children in Egypt are not taken for postnatal care visits to a doctor within two months of birth. According to 2008 DHS, about 70 percent of children were not taken to a doctor within two months of birth, down from 81 percent in 2000.

The situation was quite different back in 2000 when wealth quintiles as well as father's education were significant correlates of stunting, in addition to regional variables. On the other hand, with a successful fortification program, Egypt has achieved a significant reduction in iodine deficiency over the 2000s. For instance, in 2000, three in four children under the age of five lived in households where salt was not adequately iodized, compared to only one in four by 2008. 9 The rapid expansion in availability of iodized salt benefited households in all regions, and across all income groups. In rural areas, the share of children living in households with inadequately iodized salt declined from about 83 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2008, and from 87 to 44 percent among the poorest quintile (Figure 5). However, disparities in access to iodine based on wealth still persist. While less than 11 percent of children in the top quintile are reported to have insufficient iodine, over 44 percent of children in the bottom quintile live in households with inadequate (or no) iodized salt. Similarly, the use of iron supplements by pregnant mothers improved significantly between 2000 and 2008. In about 43 percent of pregnancies that ended in birth in 2008 mothers did not receive iron supplementation tablets, which represents a significant improvement from the 72 percent registered in 2000 (Figure 6). Similar to the antenatal care section, mother's education and wealth are strong correlates of whether blood samples are taken from the mother during pregnancy. In 2000, a child born to a mother with no formal education and in the poorest wealth quintile was 36 percentage points less likely to have received iron supplements during pregnancy, compared to a child born to a mother with higher education and in the richest wealth quintile. By 2008, the differences across circumstance groups relating to this variable were still large but less: a child born to a mother with no formal education and in the poorest quintile was 18 percentage points less likely to receive iron supplementation."

Immunizations coverage was already high in 2000 and remained that way in 2008. The post-natal checkup variable remains at lower levels of coverage (with only about 30 percent of children in the 0-4 year age group) and falls below the 40 percent threshold for HOI in 2008, while the other healthcare utilization variables are all above the 60% threshold.

In 2008, wealth status is another major factor in determining access to and utilization of healthcare during pregnancy and the postnatal period(Figure 12). About a third of the differences across circumstances in terms of whether the birth was assisted by skilled staff and whether it took place in a health facility are explained by wealth (proxied by asset quintiles).

Nutritional deficiencies combine with other risk factors, such as lack of cognitive stimulation, for a large share of the least advantaged children, which makes this group particularly vulnerable.
