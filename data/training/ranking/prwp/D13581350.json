        "text": "Concentration depends on two key characteristics of the size distribution of \u2026rms: their number (fewness) and the inequality of their sizes (dispersion). 2 Previous 0 This paper-a product of the Environment and Energy Team of the Development Research Group-is also being published in the Review of Industrial Organization. 1 There is a vast theoretical and empirical literature on market structure and its various elements such as the 4-\u2026rm concentration ratios. See among others: White (1982) , Scherer and Ross (1990) , Schmalensee (1989) , Berry and Reiss (2007) . 2 High levels of concentration may be achieved in two di\u00a4erent ways. The number of \u2026rms operating in the industry might be very small. In that case, concentration will be high, even if the \u2026rms' market shares are approximately equal. Alternatively, the number of \u2026rms may be large, but their market shares could be very unequal, leading again to high concentration (Sutton, 1998) . empirical studies have focused on the technological explanation of concentration, underscoring the signi\u2026cance of the cost curve (especially the minimum e\u00a2 cient scale of production) and barriers to entry by new \u2026rms (Davies and Lyons, 1982) . Implicitly these studies have emphasized the numbers equivalent component of concentration. This paper departs from mainstream practice by focusing on the observed inter-industry di\u00a4erences in the dispersion of \u2026rm sizes-the variance equivalent component of concentration.",

        "text": "The paper invokes one of the fundamental welfare properties of contestable markets, which refers to the absence of any sort of ine\u00a2 ciency in production in industry equilibrium. Any unnecessary cost, like any excess pro\u2026t, would constitute an invitation to entry and render incumbents vulnerable to being displaced by more e\u00a2 cient entrants (Baumol, 1982) . Thus, in contestable industries with U-shaped average cost curves, we should observe a very low dispersion in the size distribution of \u2026rms-i.e., \u2026rms could stay in the market only if they produce at the minimum point of the average cost curve, or its neighborhood. In markets that are not contestable, on the other hand, ine\u00a2 cient industry structures characterized by a large dispersion of \u2026rms around the minimum point could be sustainable even in the long run. Moreover, the extent to which an industry is contestable depends critically on the magnitude of sunk costs-i.e., the irreversible costs that must be borne by an entrant but are mostly bygone for the industry's incumbent \u2026rms (Martin, 1989) .",

Subsequent work re\u2026ned Gibrat's model by integrating a process of entry and exit into the traditional growth-of-\u2026rms formulation and imposed a variety of ancillary assumptions (e.g., \u2026rms are born at a constant rate as the industry evolves, there exists a minimum size of \u2026rms above which unit costs are constant, \u2026rms cannot decline below a certain minimum size) and stability conditions to the underlying random walk process (Kalecki, 1945; Simon, 1955 Simon, , 1960 Simon and Bonini, 1958; Ijiri and Simon, 1977; Steindl, 1965; Levy and Solomon, 1996; Sutton, 1997; Gabaix, 1999; Malcai et al., 1999) . Although the assumption that enterprise growth is a random walk con \u2021icts with economic intuition and the most fundamental theories of the \u2026rm, early studies found that stochastic processes adhering to Gibrat's law generate highly skewed size distributions that conform fairly closely to real-world ones.",

One of the most fundamental and novel features of the theory of contestable markets is the explicit recognition that the structure of an industry is determined primarily by economic forces. The number of \u2026rms, the dispersion in their sizes, and so on, are determined endogenously and simultaneously with the vectors of the industry's prices and outputs. 4 Under perfect contestability, the opportunity for costless entry and exit guarantees the absence of any ine\u00a2 ciency in production in industry equilibrium; i.e., it renders any ine\u00a2 cient organization of the industry unsustainable. The incumbent \u2026rms must operate in an e\u00a2 cient manner because any unnecessary costs, like any excess pro\u2026t, would simply invite entry and lead to their displacement by entrants who can supply the same output at lower cost. Thus the incumbent \u2026rms must minimize costs, and total industry output must be divided among its \u2026rms so as to minimize the industry's total production cost (Baumol, 1982 ).",

Under perfect contestability, a market structure that is characterized by a dispersion of \u2026rm sizes around the unique minimum point would not be consistent with industry equilibrium in the long run.

        "text": "Perfect contestability requires that: (i) all entry investment is fully reversible, i.e., there are no sunk costs; (ii) all producers have access to the same technology; (iii) incumbents cannot adjust their prices instantaneously, i.e., there must be a positive price response lag; and (iv) there is no consumer goodwill, i.e., consumers respond instantly to price di\u00a4erentials. Clearly, alternate representations of imperfect contestability in real world markets could be based on violations of any of the above conditions. This paper focuses on condition (i) and employs the degree of sunkenness of the entry investment as the primary criterion for contestability. The economic signi\u2026cance of sunk costs has received considerable attention in the industrial organization literature. Sunk costs lower the quasi-rents that the entrant can expect to earn by committing resources to the market; diminish the rate at which entry responds to positive incumbent pro\u2026ts or to unnecessary incumbent costs; and, like entry barriers, impede the establishment of new \u2026rms. 6 By shielding ine\u00a2 cient incumbents from the pressures of competition, sunk costs can constrain market structure and may allow an ine\u00a2 cient industry con\u2026guration, characterized by a large dispersion of \u2026rm sizes around the optimum, to persist. 7 Entry frequently entails irrecoverable physical capital investments that are primarily determined by the underlying technological characteristics of the industry's production-i.e., tangible sunk costs that are largely exogenous. In many industries, however, there are crucial cost components related to intangible capital that re \u2021ect strategic decisions by the incumbent \u2026rms. The two most obvious examples of discretionary sunk cost expenditures are advertising and R&D outlays (Kwoka and White, 2001) . Indeed, there is empirical evidence that in some (primarily consumer goods) industries, advertising as a sunk cost is even more important to the total entry barrier than tangible sunk costs (Kessides, 1986) . Entry and competition in knowledge-intensive industries requires large R&D expenditures. Although these investments generate valuable knowledge-based assets, such assets are largely intangible and highly \u2026rm-speci\u2026c (O'Brien and Folta, 2009).",

        "text": "Intangible sunk costs could play an important role in explaining cross-industry di\u00a4erentials in \u2026rm size dispersion. Their impacts, however, are more complex and their causal mechanism requires careful attention. Advertising, for example, constitutes a sunk cost barrier to entry. For the potential entrant, the need to advertise leads to an unrecoverable entry cost in the case of failure. Large sunk investments in advertising may allow incumbents credibly to preempt potential entrants (Thomas, 1996) . On the other hand, by providing information about the existence of alternative products and their price-quality characteristics, advertising reduces the search costs that are faced by consumers, thereby decreasing their loyalty and inertia. It may also allow \u2026rms to operate in di\u00a4erentiated product niches. Thus, entrants could perceive a greater likelihood of success in markets where advertising plays an important role. In that case, advertising may actually facilitate entry and enhance market contestability (Martin, 2002) . Similar arguments could be made for R&D. Which of these two countervailing e\u00a4ects dominates is clearly an empirical question. 8 The e\u00a4ect of contestability in tightening the distribution of \u2026rms around the optimum will be most pronounced in industries with average cost curves that have a smooth U shape and are thus characterized by a unique minimum point. Clearly, this e\u00a4ect will be somewhat diluted in industries with U-shaped curves with a \u2021at bottom (depending on the relative length of the \u2021at portion of the curve). However, it is important to note that the e\u00a4ect will not break down even in industries with L-shaped average cost curves. First, contestability will in \u2021uence the number of \u2026rms locating in the sub-optimal sector, i.e., \u2026rms of size less than M ES. In the long run, under perfect contestability, the density of the suboptimal sector will be reduced to zero. Second, the factors that a\u00a4ect the degree of contestability ultimately determine the probability of entry. Firm size inequality is a\u00a4ected by the probability of entry. The higher is the rate of entry, the smaller are size inequalities (Simon and Bonini, 1958; Davies and Lyons, 1982) . Thus, the degree of contestability will be related to the size distribution of \u2026rms even when average costs are L-shaped.",

The null hypothesis of homoscedasticity is not rejected at conventional levels of signi\u2026cance. 13 However, the test derived by Wooldridge (2002) , suggests that the null hypothesis of no \u2026rstorder autocorrelation is rejected in favor of AR(1). 14 The inferences drawn from the 1982, 1987, and 1992 temporal cross-sections are supported by the pooled data. Both OLS and FGLS regressions produce statistically signi\u2026cant parameter estimates.

When (15) and (18) are estimated with OLS, the maintained hypotheses H 01 : b 1 = b 2 and H 02 : c 1 = c 2 are not rejected at the 5 percent level. 15 However, we do note a di\u00a4erence in the estimated parameters when equations (15) and (18) are estimated with OLS and when they are estimated with FGLS. This is not surprising since OLS and FGLS are di\u00a4erent estimation procedures; and, in any case, it is not easy to determine whether such di\u00a4erences are statistically signi\u2026cant. 16 1 3 We perform the Bickel (1978) version of the Breusch-Pagan test on (18) . This tests for both within and between heteroscedasticity. We regress the squared residuals on powers of the predictions: for = 5; F =1:03 and P rob > F = :39: Thus for = 5, the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity cannot be rejected at the 5% level.

However, our \u2026nding that a 3 and d 3 are signi\u2026cantly positive is also consistent with the view that advertising may allow \u2026rms to operate in di\u00a4erentiated product niches and away from the minimum point of the average cost curve without being vulnerable to displacement by potential entrants. Equation 20: Equation 21: This paper's key testable hypothesis is that contestability tightens the distribution of \u2026rms around the optimum. The extent to which costs are sunk is central to the contestability of markets. Thus, there is an implied causal link between the variables that determine the sunkenness of the industry's capital-i.e., the rate of depreciation and the intensity of the rental and resale markets-and the dispersion of \u2026rm sizes in the industry. However, one potential objection to our interpretation of these results is that the variables that determine sunkenness might themselves be a\u00a4ected by market structure-i.e., that a reverse causal link might be present in the estimated relationships. In exploring the potential reverse causation, it will be easier to focus on equation (15) .",

For this we adopt a simple linear speci\u2026cation where the dependent variable as well as all explanatory variables appear in their natural form.

We have also made an e\u00a4ort to take into account intangible sunk costs.

For example, in Table 3 , when advertising is omitted from (20) and 21 Table 3 reveals that the e\u00a4ects of REN i , DEP i , and RES i are more pronounced when advertising sunk costs are taken into account. Moreover, when we divide our sample into consumer and producer goods industries, we \u2026nd no statistically signi\u2026cant di\u00a4erence in the e\u00a4ects of the variables that determine sunk costs (tangible and intangible) across the two groups. 19 Also, the inclusion of the capital/sales variable makes no signi\u2026cant di\u00a4erence in the estimated coe\u00a2 cients of REN i , DEP i , and RES i .",

This ranking of sunkenness is available from the authors upon request. 2 1 Cabral (1995) examines the role of sunk costs in the context of a theoretical model analyzing the relationship between \u2026rm growth and \u2026rm size. the smaller is \u2026rm size dispersion within the industry. These \u2026ndings are robust to alternative measures of \u2026rm size dispersion, the time period chosen, estimation procedures, and functional speci\u2026cation. Both tangible and intangible sunk costs have a statistically signi\u2026cant in \u2021uence on the size distribution of \u2026rms. This paper provides indirect support for one of the most fundamental welfare properties of contestable markets: the absence of any sort of ine\u00a2 ciency in production in industry equilibrium. Incumbents whose outputs di\u00a4er substantially from the minimum scale of operation cannot withstand the pressure of potential entrants who, in the presence of low sunk costs, can e\u00a4ectively exploit the opportunities offered by the presence of ine\u00a2 ciency and waste in production through hit-and-run entry. Thus the forces of contestability, facilitated by low sunk costs, continuously work to weed out ine\u00a2 cient \u2026rms through a process of \"creative destruction\". Our \u2026ndings provide speci\u2026c guidance for the design of appropriate public policies towards investment and changes in regulatory regimes to enhance the contestability of markets. Accelerated depreciation policies, favorable tax treatment of leasing operations, and the removal of regulatory restrictions on the types of capital (e.g., new versus used) deployed by entrants are some obvious candidates. 22 ",
