        "text": "A decision-making process is considered democratic if it results in an outcome that re \u2021ects the \"will of the people\". Democracy's central challenge is to discern this will, particularly among people with di\u00a4erent preferred outcomes. The theory of democracy proposes, according to Jon Elster(1986) , two solutions to this challenge. The \u2026rst solution, the subject of social choice theory, aggregates preferences across individuals. In this view of the world individuals do not interact with each other, they simply express their preferences, as they would do in a market transaction. The main \u2026nding of social choice theory is a negative one: Arrow's impossibility theorem states that a rule for aggregating individual preferences, satisfying a set of reasonable conditions, does not exist. The second solution to the democratic challenge is deliberation. Instead of aggregating preferences across individuals, the ideal deliberative process consists of discussions during which some individuals can be persuaded by others to change their preferences and at the end of which \"unanimous preferences\" (Elster, 1986, p. 112) emerge. To Elster, the distinction between the two decision making processes is akin to the distinction between \"the market and the forum\". In this paper we use data extracted from transcripts of village meetings, coupled with household surveys, to empirically explore the mechanism of deliberation. In particular, we look at the extent to which individual preferences for public goods are matched by discussion of public goods in the meetings.",

        "text": "There is a large literature on processes that aggregate individual preferences -particularly on voting behaviors, but the literature on deliberative processes is relatively sparse: Osborne, Rosenthal, and Turner(2000) study participation in meetings from a theoretical perspective. Their model assumes that individuals have favorite policies represented by a point in a multidimensional space, with valuations depending only on the Euclidean distance between the implemented 2 policy and their favored policy. This model predicts that only individuals with extreme positions participate in meetings. They assume that the outcome of the meeting is a function of the favorite policies of the participants and conclude that the outcome is likely to be random. Turner and Weninger(2005) do an empirical test of this theoretical model using data on the participation of \u2026rms in public regulatory meetings. They \u2026nd that \u2026rms with preference for extreme rather than moderate policies are much more likely to attend. Besley, Pande, and Rao(2005a) , using the same household level data from our paper, study the determinants of participation in village meetings. They \u2026nd that women, illiterates, and the wealthy(in term of asset ownership) are less likely to attend the meetings but disadvantaged castes and the landless are more likely to attend.",

This has led countries around the world to give increasing powers to local governments (Bardhan and Mookherjee 2006) .

        "text": "Much of what we know about the empirics of deliberative processes is from deliberative polls which are a set of methods developed by the political scientist James Fishkin and his colleagues where groups of randomly chosen individuals are gathered in groups to conduct discussions on particular subjects (http://cdd.stanford.edu/). The method has generated a wealth of information on deliberation, but it has the limitation that the deliberative processes studied are not a part of a regular and routine system of government but the result of an academic intervention within a constrained setting. Studies of deliberative systems of government are very rare and largely qualitative. Jane Mainsbridge's(1983) seminal ethnography of town meetings in Vermont provides rich insights into how deliberation works as a system of government and comes closest to an analysis of the kind we conduct in this paper. Her work outlines the complexity of the deliberative process but largely supports the idea that common interests facilitate deliberation, particularly in settings where citizens prefer to avoid adversarial discussions 3 . On the other hand, James Madison in the Federalist Papers (Federalist No. 10, 1787) famously cautioned that \"a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.\" Similarly, Albert Hirschman(1976) has argued that deliberation may be manipulated by an \"articulate minority\". There is, however, a lack of credible evidence testing whether deliberative processes can result in domination by a faction (Fishkin and Lushkin (p. 294) ).",

Our data consisting of transcripts of open village meetings, gram sabhas, empowered by the Indian constitution to make important decisions for the village, linked with household-level preferences, enable us to examine the relationship between individual preferences and the preferences that emerge during deliberations. We \u2026nd that the preferences of the landed class are more likely to be mentioned in the meeting and are also taking up more time in the meetings. Equally important, the voices of disadvantaged castes, while not dominating the meeting, are also heard. The transcript data allow us to distinguish between o\u00a2 cials' and villagers' talk, as well as between men's and women's talk. Using these partitions, we are able to more accurately pinpoint the source of these e\u00a4ects. We \u2026nd that the land dominance e\u00a4ect does not stem from the o\u00a2 cials favoring the landed in their talk but rather from the landed being more vocal among villagers. In addition, we \u2026nd that the preferences of the disadvantaged castes are more likely to be mentioned in the o\u00a2 cials' talk but not in the villagers' talk. Within villagers' talk we also notice that the preferences of Muslims are taking up less time, relative to the those of Hindus.",

Another notable \u2026nding is that within women's talk the preferences of women take up more time. This \u2026nding is particularly important in light of the measures taken by the Indian government to promote the political participation of women. In the transcripts we were also able to identify instances where decisions regarding the provision or maintenance of public goods were taken. Using these instances, we \u2026nd that decisions, and in particular positive decisions, are more likely to be reached for the public goods preferred by the landed class. We want to emphasize that the evidence of inequities is restricted to the deliberative space of the village meetings. We do not have data about the policy outcomes that may follow these meetings, so we cannot say whether the inequities in deliberation translate into inequities in outcomes.",

Having reviewed the types of preferences expressed by individuals, we move on to analyzing how often these preferences are mentioned during village meetings. Table 6 presents the summary of preference matching. We observe that the average individual has a 90 percent chance of having her preference mentioned during the meetings. Furthermore, the average individual's priority takes up 21 percent of the discussion. Looking at the breakdown by type of speaker we observe o\u00a2 cials are more likely than villagers to mention the average individual's preference. We can interpret this as o\u00a2 cials being more substantive and egalitarian in their speech, while villagers'speech may possibly leave more room for competition between villagers for expressing their preferred topic. A similar comparison can be made between matching within men's and women's talk. The men, taking up the overwhelming majority of the discussions, are much more likely to mention the average individual's preference. As for decisions, the average individual has a 28 percent chance of having his preference decided on during the meeting.

Speci\u2026cally, owning 10 more acres of land increases the owners match likelihood by 1 percent, and being part of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled tribe increases one's match likelihood by 3 percent. Hence, the di\u00a4erence in match likelihood between an SC/ST and a Forward Caste 15 is the same as the di\u00a4erence between a landless individual and a very large landowner owning 30 acres of land. These two e\u00a4ects imply that owning more land gives one a stronger voice in village meetings, but also that being a\u00a4orded the bene\u2026ts of a\u00a2 rmative action in the case of SC/STs helps in being heard. Being a Muslim reduces the time dedicated to one's preference by about 2 percent. This discrimination e\u00a4ect against Muslims is particularly important in the light of the SC/ST e\u00a4ect.

Furthermore, in the villagers' speeches, the large landowners are not only more likely to have their priority mentioned, but that it takes up a larger fraction of the discussion. Speci\u2026cally, owning 10 more acres of land increases the owners preference match likelihood by 2 percent and the match intensity by 0.6 percent. Decomposing the caste e\u00a4ect, we observe that the advantage of SCSTs is driven by an increased preference match likelihood within o\u00a2 cials' talk, which is not paralleled in the villagers' talk. A possible interpretation of this e\u00a4ect, is that attention to the needs of the SCSTs is mandated via targeted programs and o\u00a2 cials are trying to ensure that these programs are implemented. Being an SCST is associated with a 3 percent increase in match likelihood within o\u00a2 cials speech, but this increased likelihood is not accompanied by an increased intensity.

In a related paper, using the same transcript data, we have found that in villages where the position of Gram Panchayat president is reserved for women, women to tend to talk more during the village meetings (Ban and Rao 2008b) . This \u2026nding implies that a\u00a4ording voice to the women has real bene\u2026ts for the women's community.

We \u2026nd that again, owning more land increases the likelihood of having one's preference decided upon.

We use a unique dataset of transcripts of gram sabhas (village meetings) in South India to learn about the process of deliberation. These meetings are a part of the system of village government, held at regular intervals, and are empowered by the Indian constitution to make important decisions for the village. We \u2026nd that powerful groups, such as large landowners exert an unduly large in \u2021uence on the deliberative process, as their preferences are more likely to be mentioned and dominate the deliberations by taking up more time. This e\u00a4ect is a true dominance e\u00a4ect as it occurs in the villagers' discourse, and does not re \u2021ect preferential treatment from o\u00a2 cials who attend the meeting. Our results also",

We conducted village level facility surveys recording the quality of roads in the village in November 2001 and again in 2005. Using the transcript data from the \u2026rst round, to limit the potential for reverse causality, we \u2026nd that villages where discussion about roads dominate the gram sabha also experience a greater improvement in the quality of roads between 2001 and 2005. The quality of roads is measured on a scale from 1 to 6, 1 being a mud road and 6 being an asphalt road. The improvement in roads is measured as the fraction of roads, by length, that has moved upward in quality between 2001 and 2005. In estimating the relationship between discussion about roads and improvement we control for initial road quality, a wide range of village level variables, and block \u2026xed e\u00a4ects. We also perform a falsi\u2026cation test, by estimating the relationship between discussions about water and road improvement, and we \u2026nd no relationship.
