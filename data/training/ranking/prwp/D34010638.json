                "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions to the global economy, with significant effects on livelihoods particularly in developing and emerging economies. To stem the spread of the virus and save lives, governments around the world imposed restrictions on movement of people. Notable among these restrictions were stay-at-home (SAH) orders or lockdowns and social distancing. As a consequence, many (non-essential) employment activities also transitioned to home-based-work (HBW). For work environments, where home-based-work was not possible, workers often worked in shifts to reduce the capacity of people at the work place at any given point in time. In the developing world, where majority of people work in the informal sector, these restrictions and SAH orders were less strict due to the economic and logistic constraints. Nonetheless, overall, the restrictions and associated impact on the global economy have implications on energy demand. For instance, the transition to HBW is likely to increase residential energy consumption while decreasing non-residential consumption, especially given the important role of energy in the modern economy. At the same time, pandemic relief measures such as electricity subsidies implemented in several countries are likely to have intended and unintended consequences on electricity consumption (Saltane et al., 2022; Berkouwer et al., 2022) .",

The choice of these countries is motivated by two unique features: (i) Ghana has one of the highest electrification rates (86%) in Africa, while access rate in Rwanda remain relatively low (47%) but rising; 1 and (ii) Ghana offered electricity subsidies to customers during the pandemic while Rwanda did not. Thus, data from these countries will provide comprehensive evidence of the effect of the pandemic and associated policy measures on households and firms in the context of developing economies. Specifically, we seek to address two key questions: first, how did the pandemic affect electricity consumption by households and firms in the developing world? Second, to what extent did pandemic relief measures such as electricity subsidies matter for mediating the impact of the pandemic on households?",

The main challenge relates to the universal nature of the pandemic and the wide reach of the lockdowns (SAH) in many countries. This limits the ability of researchers to identify \"credible\" treated and control units for causal identification of impacts. In addition, energy use patterns entail significant amount of seasonalities, hence, a simple beforeafter differences in consumption levels may not reflect the impact of the pandemic.",

Essentially, for each customer, we use the typical electricity consumption levels in the previous (non-COVID) years as the counterfactual, i.e., the level of consumption in the absence of COVID. We include customer fixed effects and location-year fixed effects to purge customer specific and temporal factors that influence consumption. In addition, we explicitly control for monthly average temperature and total precipitation to absorb the effect of seasonal weather patterns on electricity consumption.",

                "text": "Six main results emerge from the paper. First, residential electricity consumption during the pandemic increased in both Ghana and Rwanda, albeit the rate of increase was higher in the former. Specifically, average household consumption increased by about 23% in Ghana compared to 4% in Rwanda. Second, consumption in the non-residential sector declined by about 11% in Rwanda, while rising marginally in Ghana by about 6% in Ghana. Third, industrial consumption declined in both countries, highlighting the effect of COVID-induced business closure and supply chain disruptions on the activities of the industrial sector. Fourth, the effect of COVID on electricity consumption was pronounced in lockdown and non-lockdown communities, as well as both rural and urban communities. This highlights the effects of the pandemic across various segments of the population. Fifth, pandemic relief measures such as electricity subsidies administered in Ghana played a key role in raising consumption. While the subsidies were important to sustaining households' consumption from falling below pre-pandemic levels, they also induced an unintended consequence: excess consumption among households. Finally, contrary to earlier criticisms that the design of the subsidy program in Ghana was regressive (Berkouwer et al., 2022) , our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the total subsidies to low-income (lifeline) customers were about 67% higher than total subsidies received by middle/high-income (non-lifeline) households (customers). This is largely driven by the extension of the subsidy for longer duration for low-income households.",

Cicala (2020) for instance shows that the COVID pandemic led to a substantial increase in electricity consumption by residential customers in the United States. Commercial and industrial users on the other hand experienced a decline in consumption, with the transition to home-based work as the main reason for the differential impacts across the customer groups.",

To ameliorate the effects of the SAH order and other related restrictions on household welfare, the government provided free food and other basic essentials to vulnerable households. In addition, the government established an Economic Recovery Fund to support the recovery of businesses hardest hit by the pandemic to enable them to survive, resume operations and safeguard employment, thereby cushioning the economic effects of the pandemic. The fund was particularly targeted at hotels and operators in the tourism sector which were heavily hit, as global travel plummeted.

The Ghana data comes from the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), which is the largest distributor in the country with operations in the southern and middle belts. It accounts for nearly 70% of all electricity customers in the country. We use data on billing records of the universe of electricity customers of the ECG from January 2018 to December 2020. The data identifies customer types based on the tariff applicable: residential (households), non-residential, and heavy industries. For each customer and year-month, it records the amount (kWh) of electricity consumed, the monetary value in Ghana Cedis (GHS), meter type (postpaid vs prepaid), and location (district) of the customer. In all, the data contains 42 million customer-year-month observations. The Rwanda data comes from the Energy Utility Corporation Limited (EUCL), the main distributor, via the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA). The dataset contains the billing records of the universe of electricity customers in Rwanda from January 2018 to December 2020. The data identifies customer type based on the tariff applicable: residential, non-residential (commercial, hotels, health centers, and public works ( water storage and pump stations, broadcasters)), and small-and-medium industries. Also, all customers in the dataset use prepaid meters: Rwanda has a universal roll-out of prepaid meters, with large and heavy industries the only exception who are allowed to use postpaid meters. Our data exclude these customers (i.e. large and heavy industries). For each customer, we have monthly records on the amount (kWh) of electricity consumed (purchased), the monetary value in Rwandan Francs (RWF), location (community/district), and rural-urban status.

The first relates to the role of seasonalities in energy demand. Temperature and rainfall patterns are key drivers of energy demand around the world, and given that these weather patterns vary based on the time of the year, monthly changes in electricity consumption to a large extent are influenced by the prevailing weather conditions. Thus, pre-post differences in household electricity consumption may reflect the seasonal patterns in electricity consumption and not necessarily the effect of the pandemic and its associated stay-at-home orders. Secondly, the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wide reach of the stay-at-home orders pose severe challenges to the identification of the counterfactual, as one cannot identify a relevant control group.",

Hence, in this setup, we treat April as, effectively, the start of the SAH order in Ghana. 13 Similarly, n \u03c9=0 2019 k=2018 \u03b2 \u03c9 k (1(k) \u00d7 1(month > M arch = \u03c9)) represent monthly event dummies for the months between March and December in the respective years. X imt is a vector of time-varying controls, mainly, monthly temperature and precipitation in the household's (firm's) locality (district), to absorb the effects of changing weather patterns on electricity demand. \u03f5 imt is the idiosyncratic error term. The parameter, \u03b2 \u03c9 2020 , estimates the pre-post (first) differences in electricity consumption in the months after the SAH relative to the months immediately before the SAH in 2020. 14 As indicated earlier, there is evidence of seasonalities in electricity consumption, which may confound the \u03b2 \u03c9 estimates. Therefore, to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on consumption, we use households' (firms') own electricity consumption in the previous non-COVID years (2018-2019) as a counterfactual (Irwin et al., 2021) . The intuition is that, in the absence of COVID, household's (firm's) monthly consumption in 2020 would have evolved along a similar pattern as their respective average monthly consumption in the preceding years (Irwin et al., 2021) . To this end, we (arbitrarily) roll back the March (April) SAH order to the previous non-COVID years (2018-2019) and estimate the pre-post differences over the period (denoted by \u03b2 \u03c9 2018 and \u03b2 \u03c9 2019 respectively), and use these estimates to adjust 11 It is important to emphasize that for customers on prepaid electricity meters, purchases may not be necessarily equal to consumption in a given month, as a consumer can purchase more electricity than she can consume in a given month, effectively consuming the remainder in the following month. However, this is less likely to be an issue given that the majority of households make small purchases, several times a month, effectively purchasing what they need for a given period (day/week), probably due to income constraints. Hence, at the margin, purchases are likely to approximate consumption.",

                "text": "Consumption by the residential sector increased however throughout the period, ranging between 2.2% and 6.8%. The SAH orders and associated Home-Based-Work, are possible reasons for the increase in consumption by residential users. Interestingly, Figure 1c shows a consistent decline in non-residential electricity consumption from March through December 2020. The largest decline was recorded in one month after the start of the SAH (lockdown), with consumption falling by 24% relative to the average consumption during the same period in the preceding years. 16 Despite signs of recovery from months 2-9 after the start of the SAH order, consumption levels never reached the pre-pandemic levels. The effect on the industrial sector, however, appears to be short-lived ( Figure 1d ). Consumption fell significantly by 13.5% and 21% during the first and second months of the SAH, but bounced back to pre-pandemic levels after the lifting of the SAH. 17 To fully understand the significant decline in non-residential electricity consumption during the pandemic, we conduct separate analyses for the main groups within the nonresidential category, namely: hotels, health centers, and others. The DID estimates are presented in Table 3 and Figure 2 . 18 The results on the effects of COVID on electricity consumption of commercial units (Figure 2a ) mimics the changes in consumption for the overall non-residential sector (Figure 1c ). This is largely a result of the fact that com-mercial units account for about 90% of the non-residential sample in our study. Figure  2b also indicate that hotels (tourism sector) were heavily affected by the pandemic as electricity consumption declined significantly during the three months lockdown period. While consumption improved after the lockdown was lifted, it still remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. This result is in line with economic data from several countries indicating the devastating impact of the pandemic on the tourism sector's contribution to GDP 19 due to SAH and restrictions on international travels (Mulder, 2020; Abbas et al., 2021) .",

The DID estimates are shown in Figure 4 and Table 7 . 22 The results show an overall increase in electricity consumption relative to the pre-COVID period, with the highest increase observed during the first month of the COVID lockdown in Ghana (April 2022). During the first month of the start of the SAH order, the average consumption (all users) increased by about 53% 23 and reducing to about 10% in the fourth month after the start of the SAH, before increasing slightly thereafter (see Figure 4a or Table 7 column 2). A similar trend is observed for residential consumption as shown in Figure 4b . The spike in consumption and subsequent decline in the rate of increase in consumption can be largely attributed to the SAH in Ghana which lasted for just three weeks. The relaxation of some COVID restrictions and gradual opening of sectors of the economy potentially led to a resumption of normal activities and thus households spending more time away from home than was required during the lockdown period. For non-residential customers, we observe a spike in consumption of about 21.5% during the SAH period and declining thereafter to consumption levels close to the pre-COVID period, and rising marginally between 4% and 10% between the third and eight months after the start of the SAH order ( Figure 4c ). Industrial consumption however declined steeply (\u2248 30%) during the SAH period ( Figure  4d ). Although the rate of decline in consumption slowed after the SAH period, consumption levels remained lower throughout the entire period relative to the consumption levels in the pre-COVID period. Once again, the decline in electricity consumption by (heavy) industries in Ghana partly reflects the negative effect of the pandemic on the productive sectors of the economy. Due to the lack of detailed information on the sectoral composition of the non-residential customers, we are unable to conduct a detailed analysis within the sector as was done in the case of Rwanda.",

A lockdown was imposed only in the two large metropolitan areas: Accra and Kumasi, which jointly account for a relatively large share of the population and electricity customers. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that beyond the SAH order, restrictions on social gatherings and other outdoor events were imposed across the entire country from March 2020 through January 2021. In this section, we explore the potential effect of the SAH order on electricity consumption. To this end, we estimate the baseline results separately for users in the lockdown areas as well as those outside the lockdown areas. Results (DID estimates) are presented in Figure 5 (details in Tables 8 and 9). For residential and non-residential customers, we find no evidence of systematic differences in changes in consumption of users in lockdown and non-lockdown communities. The relatively short duration of the SAH order and the general restrictions on social gatherings across the country are plausible reasons for the seemingly similar patterns in consumption. However, we observe significant differences in changes in industrial consumption between lockdown and non-lockdown communities (Figure 5d ). Interestingly, industrial consumption in the two areas fell significantly during the SAH month, albeit with a large decline in lockdown communities. However, industrial consumption in non-lockdown communities returned to pre-COVID levels immediately thereafter, while industrial consumption in lockdown communities continued to remain lower than pre-COVID levels, despite a slight improvement.",

This allows us to see the trends in consumption for both lifeline and non-lifeline customers, especially the response of non-lifeline customers after the removal of their partial subsidy. The results as shown in Figure 6 reveal interesting trends in the responses to the subsidy. We see that relative to the pre-subsidy (COVID) period, electricity consumption by lifeline customers increased by between 35% and 70%. On average, between April and December 2020, electricity consumption of lifeline customers (100% subsidy) increased by about 64% relative to the average consumption in the pre-subsidy period (see Table 10 column 2 24 ). On the contrary, for non-lifeline customers (50% subsidy) demand increased only during the first two months of the subsidy, falling sharply after the subsidy removal. In fact, for the most part of the post-subsidy period, monthly consumption was below the pre-subsidy (covid) period (see Figure 6 ). 25 During the three-month period (April-June) where the partial subsidy was offered to non-lifeline customers, average consumption increased by 11% relative to the pre-subsidy period and declining thereafter by 4.3% during the post-subsidy (see Table 10 column 4). Thus, comparatively, the results provide suggestive evidence that the electricity subsidies played a key role in the relatively high increase in electricity consumption during the COVID period in Ghana. At the same time, the decline in consumption among non-lifeline residential customers after the removal of the subsidies relative to the pre-COVID era is indicative of the potential effect of COVID on household electricity consumption if the subsidies were not offered.",

Given that the subsidy for non-lifeline customers expired after the third month, while lifeline customers continued to enjoy the subsidy, we leverage the removal of the subsidy for the non-lifeline customers to conduct a \"conventional\" difference-in-difference analysis by using consumption data of the two groups between April-December, 2020 and comparing the differences in consumption between lifeline and non-lifeline customers before and after July 2020 when the subsidy for non-lifeline customers expired. So essentially, we estimate the effect of subsidy removal to identify the extent to which subsidies contributed to the stark increase in electricity consumption in Ghana as shown by the preceding results. Note that the classification of lifeline vs non-lifeline customers in the subsidy program was determined based on March consumption, and since the subsidy was announced on March 30, consumers plausibly had no control in manipulating the extent of the subsidy they received. Also, at the start of the program, both customer classes were expected to receive subsidies for a period of three months. It was not until the end of the first phase of the program that an announcement was made that the subsidy was being extended for lifeline customers.

Such a sizeable increase in consumption is plausibly responsible for the gap in the residential electricity consumption between Ghana and Rwanda during the COVID period. Thus to summarize, the main takeaway from the analysis herein is that: (i) the COVID relief packages via electricity subsidies offered by the government of Ghana were useful in mitigating the effects of COVID on households, as it allowed them to sustain (electricity) consumption; (ii) however, at the same time the subsidies also induced unintended consequences: excessive consumption among recipient households.",

The initial design of the subsidy offered, respectively, lifeline and non-lifeline consumers 100% and 50% subsidies on their consumption between April and June 2020. Thus while the rate of the subsidy is progressive, the actual amounts received by households appear to be regressive since non-lifeline consumers will in principle receive high-income transfers due to their relatively high consumption.

First, we compute the monthly subsidy received by the median household in each consumer group between April and December 2020 by multiplying the subsidy rate by their respective average monthly consumption. Averaging this over the period, our estimates suggest that on average, the median lifeline and non-lifeline household received GHS 12 (USD 2.14) and GHS 29 (USD 5.18) per month respectively. 26 By aggregating these over the 12 months period that lifeline consumers received the subsidies, the median lifeline customer received a total of GHS 139 (USD 25). On the other hand, non-lifeline consumers received only GHS 86 (USD 15) over their three-month subsidy period. Thus, cumulatively, the total subsidies to lifeline customers were about 67% higher than those to non-lifeline customers. Admittedly, these estimates are only indicative, and may not reflect the true amount received by households largely because the subsidies were administered at the meter level, and given the prevalence of shared metering particularly among low-income households, the share of the transfer received by households may in practice be much lower (Berkouwer et al., 2022).",

First, residential electricity consumption during the pandemic increased in both Ghana and Rwanda, albeit the rate of increase was high in Ghana than in Rwanda. Specifically, average household consumption increased by about 23% in Ghana compared to 4% in Rwanda. Second, consumption in the nonresidential sector declined by about 11% in Rwanda, while rising marginally by about 6% in Ghana. Third, industrial consumption declined in both countries, highlighting the ef-fect of COVID-induced business closure and supply chain disruptions on the activities of the industrial sector. Fourth, the effect of COVID on electricity consumption was pronounced in lockdown and non-lockdown communities, as well as, rural and urban communities. This highlights the effects of the pandemic across various segments of the population. Fifth, pandemic relief measures such as electricity subsidies administered in Ghana played a key role in raising consumption. While the subsidies were important to sustaining households' consumption from falling below pre-pandemic levels, they also induced an unintended consequence: excess consumption among households. Finally, contrary to earlier criticisms that the design of the subsidy program in Ghana was regressive, our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the subsidy amounts to low-income (lifeline) customers were about 67% higher than total subsidies received by high-income (nonlifeline) households (customers). This was largely driven by the extension of the subsidy for a longer duration for low-income households.",
