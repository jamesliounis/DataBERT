        "text": "In fragile states and areas beset by insecurity and conflict, the time available for a face-to-face interview is typically limited. That prevents administering the lengthy household consumption expenditure surveys used for measuring poverty. This paper presents a new approach to obtain unbiased estimates of poverty when the time to conduct interviews is a binding constraint. The finite list of consumption recall items is partitioned selectively into a core module and algorithmically into nonoverlapping optional modules. Each household is systematically assigned the core module and randomly assigned one of the optional modules. Multiple imputation techniques are then used to estimate total household consumption. Based on ex post simulations, the approach is demonstrated to yield reliable estimates of per capita consumption and poverty using data from a regular household budget survey collected in Hargeisa, Somaliland. The approach is then applied to a survey conducted in Mogadishu where interview time could not exceed 60 minutes.",

Therefore, approaches were developed to reduce administering time to allow collection of consumption data with significantly lower administering time. The most straightforward approach to minimize administering time reduces the number of items either by asking for aggregates or by skipping less frequently consumed items, called reduced consumption methodology. However, both approaches have been shown to underestimate consumption, which in turn overestimates poverty. 2 Splitting up the questionnaire for multiple visits is another solution but attrition issues -especially in fragile country contexts -increase required sample size and also have a high cost implication. In addition, multiple visits to the same household can increase security concerns.",

This allows updating poverty estimates by collecting only the set of indicators instead of direct consumption data. While the approach is costefficient and easy to implement in normal circumstances, the approach has two major drawbacks in the 3 context of fragility and shocks. First, the approach requires a baseline survey, which is sometimes -for example in Mogadishu -not existent. Second, the approach relies on a structural model estimated from the baseline survey. 4 In the case of shocks, the structural assumptions, which cannot be tested, are often violated. Thus, poverty updates based on the violated assumption tend to under-estimate the impact of the shock on poverty. Therefore, cross-survey imputation methodologies are not applicable in the context of shocks and fragility.",

A comparison is added with the results for a reduced consumption module. The simulation assigns each household to one optional module. The consumption data for the modules not assigned to the household is deleted. Multiple simulations are performed with varying assignment of modules to households. Across the simulations, three consumption aggregates and four poverty and inequality indicators are calculated. The consumption indicators capture the accuracy of the estimation at three different levels: the household level, the cluster level (consisting of about 9 households) and the level of the data set. In addition, the poverty headcount (FGT0), poverty depth (FGT1) and poverty severity (FGT2) as well as the Gini coefficient are calculated to capture inequality.
