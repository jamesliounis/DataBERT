In a broader sense, trade facilitation not only includes at-theborder issues, but also beyond-the-border issues, dealing for instance with the business environment, the quality of infrastructure, transparency, and domestic regulations. All of these factors have an impact on export performance through the cost channel. Trade facilitation measures can be undertaken along two dimensions: a \"hard\" dimension related to tangible infrastructure such as roads, ports, highways, telecommunications, as well as a \"soft\" dimension related to transparency, customs management, the business environment, and other institutional aspects that are intangible.",

It not only helps to circumvent multicolinearity by reducing the dimensions of the data, it is a less arbitrary and more rigorous procedure for deriving an \"aggregate\" indicator compared with averaging out primary indicators. Moreover, unlike principal component analysis, it assumes an underlying analytical model of causality assuming that unobserved variables (to be estimated by the procedure) -our indicators-cause observed variables -the primary indicators-and, thus, provides a more rigorous framework. The new aggregate indicators contain the information of a wider range of individual indicators than any previous study.",

The indicators are derived for 101 countries over the period 2004-07, a greater coverage than previous indicators and a more recent one. The indicators are derived from a pool of 20 primary indicators collected from different sources: Doing Business (DB), World Development Indicators (WDI), World Economic Forum (WEF), and Transparency International (TI).

Our study also departs from most previous papers as we estimate the gravity with a two-stage sample selection model (Heckman 1979) as in Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (henceforth, HMR) (2008) to deal with sample selection bias due to country-pairs without trade (in at least one direction) and to examine the impact of trade facilitation on the extensive and intensive margins. 3 In order to implement the Heckman procedure on our sample, an identification variable influencing the probability of exporting but not the volume is required to comply with the exclusion restriction. We enlarge the coverage of HMR's entry cost indicator, which reflects the fixed entry costs for a pair of trading countries, and use it to satisfy the exclusion restriction in the Heckman estimation method. The two-stage approach allows assessment of export performance along the intensive margin (export volume growth) and extensive margin (propensity of trade between two countries).",

First, we employ a two-step procedure to isolate the part of each trade facilitation related indicator explained by income per capita and population, and use the unexplained residuals to proxy for the trade facilitation indicators. Second, the temporal variation of the trade facilitation indicators provides an additional way to deal with the endogeneity of trade facilitation indicators, as lagged variables can be used as instruments for contemporary values. Third, we follow Freund and Rocha (2010) and restrict exports to new products to deal with reverse causality of exports to trade facilitation, as trade in new goods cannot affect investment in 'hard infrastructure' or institutional reform. To take into account omitted multilateral resistance effects, we follow the procedure originally proposed by Baier and Bergstrand (2009) for one-stage gravity estimates, and extended by Behar et al. (2009) to a twostage sample selection model, which consists of correcting bilateral variables. Our results suggest that trade facilitation reforms could improve the export performance of developing countries at the extensive and intensive margin, especially investment in physical infrastructure and regulatory reform to improve the business environment. We also find evidence that the marginal effect of infrastructure improvement on exports seems to be decreasing in per capita income, whereas the impact of ICT on exports seems to be increasingly important for richer countries.",

Reform to dismantle cartels and enhance competition along different segments of the logistics chain is crucial for lowering trade costs. effect of improved trade facilitation on trade flows. The methodology proposed by Wilson, Mann, and Otsuki (henceforth WMO) (2003) was the first to measure the impact of trade facilitation on trade performance using a gravity model. They focused on four dimensions of trade facilitation: port infrastructure, customs environment, regulatory environment, and ebusiness infrastructure. They constructed four indicators for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries for a single year by applying single averages to 13 primary variables, which were mostly collected from the WEF. They estimated a gravity model that included the four indicators as well as other typical controls, such as the income level of individual countries, geography, and tariffs. Using model estimates, WMO find that intra-APEC trade could increase by $254 billion, or 21 percent of intra-APEC trade flows, if APEC members with below-average indicators improved capacity halfway to the average for all members, about half the increase being derived from improved port efficiency.",

Njinkeu, Wilson, and Fosso (2008) analyze the impact of reforms in port efficiency, the customs environment, the regulatory environment, and service infrastructure. They find that improvements in port efficiency and service infrastructures are the primary factors driving intra-African trade expansion. Using a computable general equilibrium model, Abe and Wilson (2008) explore institutional trade facilitation indicators and find that reducing corruption and improving transparency in APEC countries to the average level of the region would increase trade in the region by 11 percent and global welfare would expand by $406 billion. Using detailed data on transit, documentation, and ports and customs delays on Africa's exports collected by Doing Business at the World Bank, Freund and Rocha (2010) find that that transit delays have the most economically and statically significant effect on African exports. They find that a one-day reduction in inland travel times leads to a 7 percent increase in exports. Iwanow and Kirkpatrick (2008) Using indices of trade restrictiveness and trade facilitation developed at the World Bank, such as the Logistic Performance Index and Doing Business in a gravity model, Hoekman and Nicita (2008) suggest that tariffs and non-tariff measures continue to be a significant source of trade restrictiveness for low-income countries despite preferential access programs. This is because the value of trade preferences is quite limited: a new measure of the relative preference margin developed in the paper reveals that this is very low for most country-pairs. Most countries with very good (duty-free) access to a market generally have competitors that have the same degree of access.",

They find that improving port efficiency from the 25th to the 75th percentile can reduce shipping costs by 12 percent. Eifert et al.

A complete specification would also require fixed effects for exporters to control for multilateral resistance terms (MRTs), 17 but their inclusion can wipe out the effect of exporter-specific variables that do not vary substantially throughout the fouryear panel, such as the trade facilitation indicators for exporters. 18 Baier and Bergstrand (2009) introduce a method for \"approximating\" price index multilateral resistance terms using a first-order Taylor expansion, yielding a log-linear expression for multilateral resistance terms (MRTs) that is a function of exogenous variables. It can be included in the estimation equation to be estimated with a simple OLS method. The approach has the advantage of producing tractable comparative statistics that underline the role of country size in MRTs, as trade barriers have a large impact on the terms of small countries, which typically trade a large proportion of their output internationally. While estimating the impact of a country's trade logistics system on its exports, Behar, Manners, and Nelson (2009) proxy MRTs using Baier and Bergstrand's method in a two-stage selection model of gravity akin to Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008) .",

Table 3 reports estimates for the two-stage Heckman selection model defined by expressions (1) and (2). Columns 1a and 1b report the estimated coefficients of the outcome and the selection equations, respectively. In the outcome equation, the coefficients of all four trade facilitation indicators are positive and significant. As trade facilitation indicators are scaled on a zero-one interval, the magnitude of estimated coefficients can be informative of the relative impact of these aspects on trade. The coefficient of physical infrastructure is, indeed, the largest of all four. Business environment seems to be the next important factor for exporters, followed by ICT and border and transport efficiency. All other coefficients are significant and have the expected signs. Indeed, higher tariffs, longer distance between partners discourage trade, as well as being landlocked. By contrast, the trade volume is higher between partners in a regional trade agreement, as well as between richer and more populous countries. Contiguous partners, countries having a common official language, and countries having had a common colonizer or a colonial relationship are also likely to trade more intensively. The selection equation estimates (column 1b) provide a hint on the impact of each determinant on the probability of exporting, the so-called extensive margin. Most coefficients are significant and have the same sign as in the outcome equations. Only the coefficient of business environment has a negative sign, although it is non-significant. The coefficient of the entry-cost variable appearing in the first stage is negative and significant, as countries with higher entry barriers are less likely to trade. 19",

In the first step, we estimate our baseline model replacing our exporter specific variables with exporter dummies. In the second step, we regress a variable 'y' containing the estimates of exporter-dummy coefficients, which can be interpreted as the volume of trade predicted by exporter dummies, on exporter's trade facilitation indicators and other variables of the model. For each regressor in the second step, we estimate the squared partial correlation (a measure of total variance of 'y' explained by the regressor and not associated to other variables) and the squared semipartial correlation (the reduction in the Rsquared when the regressor is removed from the regression). The estimates are further explained and reported in Appendix B. Overall, the trade facilitation indicators, notably physical infrastructure, have a greater contribution to the total variance of 'y' in comparison to other variables, such as tariffs, distance, or colonial dummies.",

Such an assessment can only be made within the framework of specific infrastructure project appraisals, and it can only be addressed on a case-by-case basis. However, improvement in other areas, such as border and transport efficiency, where costs are considerably lower in comparison with investment in physical infrastructure, shows promising results for developing countries. Although general estimates on the yield of these projects is difficult to obtain, Helble, Mann, and Wilson (2009) use detailed data on aid flows to estimate the responsiveness of trade flows to specific types of foreign aid directed to enhancing trade competitiveness in developing countries. They find that relatively small amounts of aid targeted at policy and regulatory reform, in contrast to aid for broad sector-specific projects or trade-related infrastructure has relatively greater elasticity with respect to trade flows. Indeed, they estimate that a one percent increase in aid directed toward trade policy and regulatory reform yields an increase of 0.009 percent in trade. This implies that average marginal effect in the authors' sample of that a one dollar increase in aid would result in an increase of about US$697 in trade. Hallaert and Munro (2009) propose to adapt the growth diagnostics procedure developed by Haussman et al. (2005) to trade expansion, in order to pinpoint the most binding constraints affecting trade performance in a given country. An approach along these lines based on a more rigorous microeconomic setting can be a promising road to identify constraints to trade expansion in a given country.",

Indeed, traditional estimates do not control properly for theoretically motivated price index terms, which aggregate both domestic and international trade costs, and therefore capture the effect of trade with third countries on bilateral trade, or \"multilateral resistance.\" AvW show that bilateral trade flows depend on bilateral trade costs relative to multilateral resistance.18 Indeed,Baier and Bergstrand (2007) recognize that one of the drawbacks of using fixed effects dummies is the preclusion of direct estimation of partial effects from numerous potentially-important explanatory variables often motivated theoretically (e.g. the effects of exporter and importer populations, foreign aid, or internal infrastructure measures on bilateral trade).

They estimate a standard gravity model augmented with these indicators and find a positive impact of the three indicators on exports. As their paper focuses on Africa, they interact their indicators with an African dummy, and find that policies that improve their indicators yield a higher effect in African countries compared with the rest of the world. Francois and Manchin (2007) use principal components to construct two indicators on infrastructure and two indicators on institutional quality from various primary measures, mainly collected by the World Development Indicators and the Fraser Institute.

Figure 2 illustrates the relative temporal variation of indicators per region. East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) seem to have an improvement along the Border and Transport Efficiency indicator and Business Environment indicator by the end of the period that is relatively larger than other regions. There is a generalized upward evolution of the ICT indicator across regions. Unsurprisingly, infrastructure is the indicator that evolves less (notice the different scale in the vertical axis for all graphs)."
