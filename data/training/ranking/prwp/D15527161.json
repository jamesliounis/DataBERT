The effectiveness is reflected in the fact that participation in decision making and the content of negotiations have continually adapted to changing economic realities. In this light, the current Doha Agenda is an aberration because it does not reflect one of the biggest-indeed tectonic-shifts in the international economic and trading system: the rise of China. If responding to the rise of China becomes an important concern of multilateral negotiations, the WTO cooperative framework can be revitalized.",

Section II shows that a significant but publicly unacknowledged impediment to concluding the Doha negotiations is the WTO members' difficulty in coming to terms with China's trade juggernaut and the policies, such as the managed exchange rate, that are perceived to fuel it but are not part of the Doha agenda. Section III takes a longer view and shows that, even with conservative assumptions about its growth and trade dependence, China's share of global trade is likely to be twice as large as that of the United States in 20 years. Section IV argues that China will continue to have a stake in maintaining an open multilateral trading system; and then assesses the implications of China seeking, as other dominant powers have often sought, to translate its power into trading privilege. Section V examines how international cooperation today can be designed in a way that anticipates China's dominance. In particular, we suggest that the time has come for an initiative on multilateral trade negotiations that builds on but redefines the Doha Agenda and that would anchor China more fully in the multilateral trading system. Such an initiative would have two pillars. First, a new negotiating agenda that would include the major issues of interest to China and its trading partners, and thus unleash the powerful reciprocal liberalization mechanism that has driven the WTO process to previous successes. The agenda would be China-informed rather than China-centered. Second, new restraints on bilateralism and regionalism that would help preserve incentives -especially in the context of a rising China -for maintaining the current broadly non-discriminatory trading order.",

In manufacturing trade, China is now a large supplier to all the major markets, and its presence has grown significantly over the course of the Doha Round negotiations. We identify the world's ten largest traders and for each of them also identify the largest sources of supply in the manufacturing sector. 1 Figure 1 presents the results. China's share in the major import markets has doubled between 2001 and 2009, and in some of the most important world markets, China now accounts for more than a fifth of total manufacturing imports. China's share of manufacturing imports in Japan is 35 percent, in the European Union about 30 percent, and in the United States slightly over 25 percent. 2 Furthermore, China looms especially large in the markets of major trading partners in sectors where protection is greatest. To illustrate this, we identify for each of the top ten trading partners, the ten most protected sectors (defined at the Harmonized Schedule (HS) 2-digit level of aggregation in 2009 in terms of the MFN tariff alone). Figure 2 depicts China's share in these sectors in the largest ten traders for 2001 and 2009.",

First, in the most protected sectors, China's share of imports in 2009 is substantially greater than for overall imports (shown in Figure 1 ) and dwarfs that of any other supplier in each of these markets. 3 For example, China's share in these sectors in Japan is over 70 percent, in Korea over 60 percent, in Brazil about 55 percent, in the United States, Canada, and the European Union about 50 percent each. Second, even in these protected sectors, China's share has increased dramatically over the course of the Doha Round. In many of the importing countries (e.g., Brazil, the European Union, and the United States), China's share has more than doubled. Also striking is how much market share China has gained even in countries such as Canada, Mexico, and Turkey that have free trade agreements with close and large neighbors. Thus, liberalization under the Doha agenda today, especially in the politically charged, high-tariff sectors, is increasingly about other countries opening their markets to Chinese exports. In short, with some exaggeration one might say that the MFN tariff of countries is really a China tariff, or the China tariff is really the -least-favored-nation\u2016 tariff.

And there the great shared but unuttered fear is of competition from an increasingly dominant China. 4 It seems today that progress in the Doha Round hinges critically on greater market opening not in services or agriculture but in manufacturing (nonagricultural market access or NAMA in WTO-speak). Services negotiations have been given insufficient attention and are now widely regarded as too complicated to deliver significant market opening in this Round. In agriculture, with food prices high and expected to remain so, import protectionism has become less salient. Rather, it is the threat of agricultural export restrictions that is more serious, but addressing it is not on the Doha agenda anyway despite the efforts of some WTO members. So, Doha today is mostly about the negotiations on market access in manufacturing. And in manufacturing trade, as shown above, China looms large especially in the most protected sectors.",

The evidence on the existence and extent of undervaluation continues to be debated. On the one hand, in a survey of studies on renminbi misalignment conducted by Cline and Williamson (2008) , 17 of the 18 studies concluded that the renminbi is undervalued; the average estimate of the undervaluation was 19 percent for the 2000-07 period as a whole and considerably higher for the 2004-07 period. On the other hand, Dunaway, Leigh, and Li (2006) argue that all estimates of renminbi undervaluation are very sensitive to underlying assumptions about models and parameters and therefore not reliable. Nevertheless, the fear persists that China will gain even greater market share as a result of any trade liberalization in the Doha Round-not just in countries' own markets but also in third markets, in each of which the effects of the exchange rate are likely to be felt.",

What China gives by way of trade concessions, it is seen as undoing through its exchange rate policy. This connection between the exchange rate and reciprocal trade liberalization has not received adequate attention and may be key to understanding the predicament today (Bergsten, xx). Source: Mattoo, Ng and Subramanian 2011A corollary of our analysis is that unless Chinese currency policy changes significantly, and unless there can be credible checks on the use of such policies in the future, the perception we outlined above will remain. There are some signs that China has slowly but surely embarked on a process of internationalizing its currency that will over time eliminate the undervaluation of the renminbi. The horizon for renminbi internationalization is as yet unclear but it is unlikely to happen over the next year or two.",

These projections do not require China to grow at anything close to the torrid rates of 11 percent that China has posted in the last fifteen years. They require China to grow at just under 7 percent a year over the next two decades. Nor do these projections require China to maintain its current trajectory of steeply rising openness (measured as the ratio of trade-to-GDP). For projecting trade, economic theory and evidence offer guidance. Just as the force between two objects in physics depends on the product of their masses and the distance between them, so trade between two countries is thought to depend on their economic mass (GDP) and all the frictions affecting trade, including transport costs and policy barriers.",

If going forward, developments such as defragmentation of production occur, the relationship of trade and income may change. One of the subtler implications of the gravity model is that trade between two dynamic countries will grow exponentially faster than trade between less dynamic ones (because trade benefits from the gravity exerted by the income of both countries). The share of intra-European trade which comprised about 29 percent of world trade in 2008 will decline to about 9 percent in 2030. In contrast intra-BRICs trade and intra-BIICs (including Indonesia rather than Russia) trade will rise dramatically; intra-Asian trade, which today is about a third of intra-European trade will surpass intra-European trade well before 2030. In other words, not only will the world's economic center of economic gravity shift to Asia, so too will the center of trade with China as the focal point, or even -hub.\u2016 of empire. To recap those numbers, the ratio of trade to GDP for the US rarely exceeded 15 percent during Pax Americana compared with China's current ratio of 57 percent (Table 3) . Over and under-trading are derived from a regression of the relevant trade measure on population (column 2), population and per capita GDP (PPP) (column 3), population, per capita GDP (PPP) and a dummy for oil producers (column 4). In each of these regressions, the coefficient on the dummy for the UK (1870), US (1975) , and China (2008) yields the magnitude of over-trading or under-trading for the relevant country. Strictly speaking, since the variables are specified in log terms, over/under-trading is obtained as the exponential of the coefficient on the relevant dummy variable minus 1.",

But there are two critical differences: China is trade dependent in a way that the US or even Germany never was, and moreover, given China's low levels of income, China's stake in openness might be greater because its rise to prosperity, on which is predicated the legitimacy of its government, will depend upon an open system.

So in the implementation of IPRs, it may favor technogical dissemination over creating incentives for innovation to an extent that creates tensions vis a vis its TRIPS obligations. For instance, the U.S. ITC (2011) estimated, based on a survey of more than five thousand U.S. IP-intensive firms, that the losses to U.S. industry from IPR infringement in China totaled roughly $48 billion in 2009 and that U.S. companies spent nearly $5 billion that year to combat this infringement. These estimates raise the question of whether China is flouting the rules in the WTO's TRIPs agreement that require countries not only to embody in their laws adequate levels of IP protection, but to implement the laws -effectively and expeditiously.\u2016 Consider China's exchange rate policy. In the case of China, its accession to the WTO is widely acknowledged to have led to considerable liberalization and hence to circumscribing China's ability to use trade policies for mercantilist purposes. Recall that China's export-focused development strategy began in the mid-1980s but it did not start generating consistently large current account surpluses until the oughties. It is not a coincidence therefore that China's mercantilism started to emerge after China's accession to the WTO. With constraints on the use trade policy instruments (including export subsidies) to sustain the export juggernaut, China turned to use policy instruments other than trade, namely the exchange rate (Rodrik, 2009) .

The problem is that the measures affecting entry into services markets, such as licensing requirements and procedures, allow for significant regulatory discretion. Recently the US complained about Chinese measures affecting trading rights and distribution services for certain publications and audiovisual entertainment products, and the WTO panel found that these measures were indeed inconsistent with China's WTO obligations. In other cases, it can be harder to disentangle the protectionist from the legitimate. For example, when China decided to impose minimum working capital requirements for each direct branch of a foreign bank located in China rather than applying (as, for example, the Europeans had requested) minimum capital requirements and capital adequacy ratios to the overall commercial presence of a bank in China, it was hard to tell whether the goal was to ensure financial stability or to inhibit foreign competition.

To an extent, these concerns are less salient, because of fundamental changes in policy, institutions and markets. Levels of protection are generally low today and legally bound at the WTO. So preferential access to markets matters less than when protection was high or could be raised vis-a-vis third countries. For example, the level of imperial preferences in 1936 was about 6-12 percent and was estimated to be twice that level in the preceding decade (McDougall and Hutt, 1954) . As discussed below, most preferences granted in the context of regional agreements today are much lowerbecause applied tariffs are much lower and because areas of high protection tend to be excluded from the agreements.

Not only do a relatively small proportion of China's exports enjoy preferential access, its nonpreferential exports are also somewhat disadvantaged. For most countries, less than 10 percent of non-preferential exports face MFN tariffs greater than 5 percent but for China (along with Japan and the EU's external trade) the proportion is twice as high (WTO, 2011). Many preferential agreements, including some of China's agreements, now also have a services dimension. Fink and Molinuevo (2008) and Marchetti and Roy (2008) have shown that these agreements typically involve wider and deeper commitments than those which countries have made under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the WTO. In other words, countries include more sectors and legally commit to greater openness in preferential agreements than they do multilaterally. But most of these commitments hover above applied policy and very few have had a liberalizing impact. For example, India has committed to allowing maximum foreign ownership of 25 percent in basic telecommunications under the GATS, to 49 percent in some of its preferential agreements, but in practice it already allows 74 percent. Even in the rare cases, where preferential agreements have induced liberalization, say in Costa Rica's elimination of its telecommunications monopoly, the new policies are at least in principle applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. Thus the cost of exclusion today from a preferential agreement in services is not worse access but less secure access, because these agreements involve not more liberalization but wider and deeper bindings.",

But such unilateral actions, which a number of countries are contemplating, could easily be construed as defensive and protectionist, especially if they are justified in the name of national security--as was the case when the U.S. Congress scuttled the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's bid for the oil firm UNOCAL in 2005.",

China, like other exporters of capital, including those in the Middle East, wants secure access to investment opportunities in foreign markets, and importers of capital have legitimate concerns about the motivations of state investors and the consequences of such transactions. Mutually beneficial bargains are there for the making. The WTO is an appropriate forum for such deals because it already regulates private and government investments in key service sectors, such as telecommunications, transport, and finance. One way to manage such investments would be to require countries importing capital, such as the United States and EU members, not to impose undue restrictions on investments. In return, investing countries would commit to following certain criteria--transparency, an arms-length relationship with governments, and the pursuit of purely commercial objectives--modeled after the voluntary code of conduct for sovereign wealth funds negotiated under the auspices of the IMF in October 2008.",

Implicit in our proposal is the recognition that it may not be possible to pursue the Doha Round as its stands to a satisfactory conclusion within any reasonable period of time.

In other words, unlike the IMF which has suffered from a democratic deficit and legitimacy problem, the WTO has suffered from over-democratization with potential blocking power even for those who are not the key protagonists of the system. If forward progress is to be made on any meaningful agenda, the negotiating process has to be streamlined so that small countries do not have a disproportionate say. In return for not holding back a new ambitious agenda, smaller countries must be offered two assurances: they would automatically receive the benefits of any new liberalization and could opt out of any obligations that are not to their advantage.",

They have all been careful not to advocate protectionist remedies but their concerns could lend legitimacy to such policies. Not least because the political support for free trade agreements has declined considerably among the public. More strikingly, a November 2010 Pew poll showed that only 28 percent of traditionally free trade-minded Republicans expressed such support, down 15 percentage points from the previous year.

Similarly, China is taking action on climate change because it sees competitive advantage in being the leader in green technology and because the retreat of the Himalayan glacier threatens its supply of water. China also might eventually move away from or beyond its current technology policy because it has itself become an exporter of technology. If reformists in China could use the relatively one-sided WTO accession process to implement key changes in policy, then surely a more symmetric WTO negotiation can empower progressive forces now to advance reforms that are in any case in the broader national interest. In this respect, it would help for China to articulate its vision for and role in forging the new system.",

Our approach does not offer a perfect solution, but a combination of such an approach combined with progressive change in the basis of the Chinese economy seems the best way forward. For example, an important way that state involvement manifests itself is through cheap financing by state-owned banks of the Chinese industrial sector. Over time, though, pressures are building-because of the non-sustainability of investment rates of close to 50 percent of GDP, the declining share of labor in GDP-to move away from these manifestations of state capitalism.",

Recognizing that importers' concerns about the reliability of supply might inhibit liberalization, some exporting countries too have advocated multilateral restrictions on the right to use export restrictions (e.g. the Cairns Group and the United States in 2000 and, more recently, Japan and Switzerland in 2008). See International Economic Law and Policy Blog (2008).15 Protection measures designed to encourage the use of domestically produced biofuels are subject to WTO rules on binding of tariffs and other duties and charges, and would normally be expected to be subject to reductions in protection under the Doha Agenda negotiations on reductions in agricultural (ethanol) or nonagricultural (biodiesel) tariffs. One surprising feature of the current negotiations is that the important protection of ethanol-which diverts the sourcing of ethanol from lowest-cost international sourcing to a reliance on domestically produced maize-is not currently subject to significant tariff reductions because almost all of this protection is provided by a measure classified as an Other Duty and Charge.",
