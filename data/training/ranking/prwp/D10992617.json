It brought political instability to some countries and the prospect of unrest to many more. The rapid increase in world food prices was caused by a combination of cumulative effects of long-term trends, more recent supply and demand dynamics, and governmental responses that have exacerbated price volatility. This crisis has exposed existing and potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities of households, governments, and the international economy to food and nutrition insecurity. The global community has responded with a range of initiatives and established instruments to assist the neediest nations. Major stakeholders worldwide continue to discuss potential instruments to address the recent food crisis and to prevent or reduce the impact of future crises. Besides agricultural productivity improvement and national food self-sufficiency targets, physical grain stocks (\"humanitarian food reserves\") have resurfaced in these discussions. And more recently, the idea of \"a 'virtual' internationally coordinated reserve system for humanitarian purposes\"-first mentioned in the G8 Leaders' Statement on Global Food Security at the Hokkaido Toyako Summit on July 8, 2008-was added to the debate.",

Before considering policy alternatives, it is obviously important to start with questions about the nature of the problem and its underlying causes. Are we witnessing the beginning of a new regime characterized by more volatile, if not higher, commodity prices? 5. The long view. A review of grain price histories reveals that the deflated prices of food grains have followed downward long-run trends, interspersed by episodes of steep price increases, followed by even more precipitous falls. In the long view, the recent price spikes do not seem anomalous. Relative to the other episodes experienced over the last 40 years, the real grain price volatility of the last few years has not been particularly high. 6 . What led to the recent price spikes? Among the more persistent changes that set the stage for the grain price spikes of 2007/08 were sustained rapid increases in income in many countries, including China and India, which increased grain demand, especially for animal feeds. Public support for biofuel production was a large and persistent shifter of demand for maize and oilseeds, whereas funding of production-oriented crops research was neglected. By 2007, these factors could hardly have been surprises that could cause prices to jump. Their net effect was rather a progressive tightening of the aggregate supply-demand balance for major grains in the preceding years. 7. Unpredictable factors in 2006-2008 included the boost in biofuel production beyond planned levels, induced by a spike in petroleum prices, the unprecedented extension of the multi-year Australian drought, other regional production problems, transport cost increases and exchange rate movements contributed importantly to price rises in global market made vulnerable by lack of stocks. Finally, the sequence of export controls, taxes and bans adopted by key exporters beginning in the thin global rice market in the fall of 2007, initially in response to consumer concerns about wheat supplies, turned market anxiety into panic.",

        "text": "8. Grain storage economics. To interpret the asymmetric and episodic behavior of grain market prices, and identify the causes of high volatility, it is crucial to understand the relation between prices, consumption and stocks. Accumulation of stocks when price is low can prevent steep price slumps. Disposal of these stocks when price is higher can smooth price spikes, but only so long as stocks are available. In a competitive market, short hedgers perform these functions, holding carryover stocks when the expected price covers the cost of storage and interest. Futures markets encourage storage by short hedgers by facilitating the transfer of price risk to long hedgers (such as grain users) or long speculators, and protecting all participants from counterparty risk. 9. Stock adjustments buffer, but do not eliminate, effects of supply shocks on consumption. When stocks run out, aggregate use must adjust one-for-one to negative supply disturbances. Less grain goes to feed animals or produce biofuel, and/or the poorest consumers must reduce their calorie consumption, incurring the costs of malnutrition, hunger or even starvation. The demand of wealthier consumers is much less responsive. When stocks are at minimum levels, large price changes are needed to induce aggregate consumption to adjust to even relatively small shocks.",

The other is that, in a food emergency (such as the one experienced in many countries in 2008), governments are often pressured by anxious consumers to take actions against storers or \"hoarders\" that reduce private storage. Recognizing their lack of ability to commit to keep markets open when price is high, governments intervene to increase total storage when price is low and availability is high.",

Focusing on price is less effective in ensuring food security for the vulnerable than focusing on their consumption. Use of price band rules to operate international or domestic market stabilization schemes has the advantage of transparency. But the effects on the behavior of prices and aggregate costs of operation are much less straightforward than often assumed. The price tends to hover at or near the upper or lower bound of the band (the \"ceiling\" or the \"floor\" price). The overall effect on volatility, relative to competitive storage, is ambiguous. Release of stocks at the ceiling price smoothes price peaks as long as stocks are available, but anticipation of this discourages private storage as price rises to the ceiling, and suppresses the stabilizing production response to anticipated shortages. Theory predicts, and experience with international commodity agreements confirms, that these programs inevitably fail, even if there is no underlying trend in price.",

Figures 3 and 4, which offer a longer view, show that the prices of wheat and maize followed downward trends for decades, reflecting the fact that yields have generally outpaced demand growth, contrary to Malthusian predictions of the 1960's. Along their downward paths, prices generally fluctuate moderately within a fairly well defined range. However, episodes of steeply rising prices, followed by precipitous falls, are prominent features of the data. The price series are asymmetric; there are no equally prominent troughs in the price series to match these spikes.",

But for fertilizers dependent on minerals deposits, increased demand might generate sustained higher prices and greater rents rather than higher supply. Injudicious advice to further subsidize particular uses of such inelastically supplied fertilizers will, if heeded, certainly increase the profits of their producers. Subsidies will have little effect on supply in the short run, but will divert global supplies from unsubsidized uses to less efficient subsidized uses, reducing overall production efficiency. Crude oil, like fertilizer, is an important input-both directly and indirectly-into modern agriculture. Its price is virtually independent of disturbances in grain markets. Crude oil prices have been very high recently, but again there does not seem to be a large effect on acreage or yield even in the countries that use petroleum intensively in production.

Thus a problem with wheat supply triggered a sequence of events-also involving other major exporters-that led to the crisis in rice prices and market access discussed in colorful detail by Slayton (2009) . As reports of production problems in other countries surfaced, governments of grain exporting countries were pressured by their own urban consumers to act to reduce grain prices. These pressures outweighed the interests of producers and traders in selling to the highest bidder. One by one, rice exporters imposed their own export restrictions, including, in March 2008, Vietnam, an important supplier. 6 It also became clear that China, apparently adequately supplied, would also act to insulate itself from market turmoil, rather than make its substantial grain stocks available to the international market as supplier of last resort.

A glance at Figure 10 reveals that the wheat price spikes in the 1970s and in 2007/08 occurred when world stock-to-use ratios were low. For the market to function effectively, a virtually irreducible minimum amount of grain must be held in the system to transport, market, and process grains. Though stocks data are notoriously imprecise, minimum working stocks are apparently close to 20% of use. 8 Comparing Figure 10 with Figure 3 shows that stocks are very unresponsive to price at these minimum levels. Similarly, comparison of Figures 4 and 11 shows that spikes in corn price occurred when stock-to-use ratios were low. A common feature of all such physical storage activity is that aggregate stocks are constrained to be non-negative. If current stocks are zero, it is impossible to \"borrow from the future.\" Another important feature of these grains (and of most minerals) is that the marginal cost of storage per period, including physical protection, insurance, and spoilage, in practice is usually modest, and the assumption of constant unit costs is a generally reasonable approximation. 9 Increases in stocks are not generally limited by storage capacity. In contrast, storage of extra water in a reservoir may incur virtually no extra cost until it reaches full capacity, beyond which extra storage is infeasible in the short run.

The first two of these, like the pre-war agreements, managed storage only indirectly via commitments to control exports, but the others involved attempts to control prices using versions of price-band schemes. When a price fell to the floor of the band, acquisitions were to be made; when a price reached the ceiling, stocks were, if available, released from the stockpile by the program's management. A later Australian wool reserve price scheme acted more like a floor price scheme with a variable release price and a buffer stock. Because of the distinctive nature of Australian wool, this program was akin to an international agreement in its effect on the market. The United States from the 1930s until the 1970s operated price support schemes involving buffer stocks of major commodities and the European Union has also made use of similar storage-related programs to support and stabilize markets.",

If, later, \"excess price surges\" were detected, the long futures positions could be offset by short sales, encouraging releases of stocks and reducing the current price. This virtual scheme, if large enough to move markets (and if allowed under the rules of relevant commodity markets), is financially risky and subject to manipulation by traders, will lose money on average, and will eventually exhaust its budget. As reported in Peck (1976) , the Federal Farm Board intervened in the United States' cotton and wheat markets using futures contracts to try to stabilize prices in the face of a bear market. This turned out to be an expensive exercise that ended up stabilizing American wheat prices for a year or so before essentially owning the United States' wheat stocks and losing a great deal of money-$188 million dollars-before being disbanded by Congress in 1933. Peck concludes that operating in the futures market did not yield the clear benefits anticipated by Houthakker (1967) .

Third, commodities neglected by index funds (such as rough rice and fluid milk) experienced large price increases, as did commodities with no futures markets at all (apples, edible beans). Fourth, index funds rebalance as grain prices rise, reducing long positions to maintain portfolio shares, and thus stabilize prices somewhat like a more flexible variant of a price-band policy. Fifth, empirical work has shown no evidence that position changes by speculators help forecast price changes in these markets. 36 Finally, if long futures market positions exacerbated price spikes last year, they must have reduced consumption and increased commodity stocks. But stocks were around minimal feasible levels in 2007/08.

One part of the argument has some plausibility and is favored by respected researchers in international finance. A brief sketch goes as follows. A large pool of global capital accumulated largely in China was invested in the United States housing market until that market collapsed. Hoards of these global dollars, seeking new targets, were dumped into the commodity markets through hedge funds and other investment vehicles. These new dollars caused commodity prices to soar. 38 All but the last sentence is plausible. The real cost of capital to major financial and commodity markets was low until the United States financial sector descended into disarray and international dollar surpluses were a part of this phenomenon. As previously noted, lower interest rates tend to be associated with higher stocks, higher current prices, and lower futures prices. But the facts regarding key agricultural commodity market behavior just quoted fail to imply any causal relation between the cash inflow and commodity price spikes. This is not surprising. No one has demonstrated that this cash increased grain stocks when, as previously noted, stocks were around minimal feasible levels for normal market operations. If the cash did not increase stocks, it cannot have reduced consumption or raised the market price in the short run. If it did increase stocks earlier, their release before the price spiked must have moderated the price increase and smoothed consumption.",

In at least one version, the interventions would be naked speculative short positions taken when a global intelligence unit using special knowledge unavailable to the market decides, using criteria not identified, that prices do not reflect \"fundamentals.\" Similar proposals made many years ago were easier to take seriously. In the last half century, a large body of work including theoretical and empirical analyses has shown how difficult it is, even for top experts, to be sure that markets are out of equilibrium and that proposed price interventions will do more good than harm.",

The price tends to hover at or near the upper or lower band, private storage is reduced or eliminated, and production is discouraged just when it is most needed. Theory predicts, and experience confirms, that these programs inevitably fail even if there is no underlying trend in price. Naked short speculation to stabilize prices is no less risky and indeed could quickly lose vast sums of money, especially if positive initial results increase the confidence of management, encouraging decisions that lead to greater financial exposure.",

Options could be created to give governments the right to acquire, in serious food supply emergencies, grains or oilseeds that would otherwise be allocated to biofuel production or animal feed. These grains could then be distributed to the target recipients, assuming appropriate prior investment in the infrastructure necessary to identify qualifying recipients and ensure effective food distribution. All parties could gain from such diversion options, which could be written as contracts with specific biofuels producers; they are not necessarily dependent on the existence of a commodity exchange.",

This approach makes sense if the factors have a linear cumulative effect on food price volatility. But their effect is highly nonlinear. When supplies are already tight, a small reduction can cause an unusually large price increase. This fact is a key to understanding recent market events and constructing appropriate policy responses. The economics of storage activity explains the relationship between grain prices and storage, and helps in the evaluation of other factors identified in discussions of recent grain price behavior, including distortion of futures markets by international financial flows, and an irrational or manipulative bubble in grain prices.

        "text": "Figure 12also shows how, when stocks are clearly above minimum working stocks, storage demand, added horizontally to consumption demand, makes market demand much more elastic (less steeply sloped) at a given price.The responsiveness of this aggregate consumption demand to price is difficult to estimate, for several reasons. One is that, in empirical demand studies at the level of the individual consumer, it is difficult to distinguish consumption from storage (including stocks held by consumers) as prices fluctuate, and when the two get confounded the estimated response overstates the consumption response. Secondly, at the aggregate level, years with high prices and negligible stocks above working levels are too rare to establish, by themselves, the steepness of the consumption demand. Estimation of the dynamic storage model enables us to use data from all available years in determining consumption demand. However, the storage model has been difficult to implement empirically. One major hurdle is, again, the lack of reliable stock (or consumption) data for global markets. (In recognition of this, grain statistics refer to \"disappearance\" rather than consumption.) Work that pioneered the econometric estimation of this model in the 1990s, assuming no supply response, finessed the data problem by estimating the model on prices alone. 14 Recent application of a model in this tradition to prices of a set of commodities suggests that aggregate food-consumption demand responds very little to changes in the price of major commodities; the slope of the consumption demand curve for major grains may be even steeper than previously believed.15  To compensate for the low price response of consumption, more of the commodity is stored and stocks run out less frequently. The storage implied by the model smoothes prices, replicating the kind of price behavior observed for major commodities.By acquiring stocks when consumption is rising and price is falling, storers can reduce the dispersion of price and prevent steeper price slumps. Disposal of stocks when supplies become scarcer reduces the severity of price spikes. If the supply of speculative capital is sufficient, storage can eliminate negative price spikes but can smooth positive spikes only as long as stocks are available. When stocks run out, aggregate use must match a virtually fixed supply in the short run. Less grain goes to feed animals and the poorest consumers reduce their calorie consumption, incurring the costs of malnutrition, hunger, or even death.Storage induces positive correlation in prices and is least effective when harvests are positively correlated; storage cannot eliminate price changes caused by persistent shifts in demand such as the recent subsidized surge in biofuel production. Note also that the storage demand shown inFigure 12would shift up, pulling total demand with it, if the supply variance rose or interest costs fell.",

An example of such a reserve forms the first part of a recent three-point proposal by von Braun et al.. It sketches an outline of a small \"independent emergency reserve\" of about 5% of the current annual food aid flow of 6.7 wheat-equivalent metric tons. This would be a decentralized reserve managed by the United Nations World Food Program and held in existing national storage facilities at strategic locations with essentially a call option on the grain deposits at precrisis prices. One would anticipate that this type of stock would be used for local and regional food shortages, often in landlocked countries or failed states. Such shortages are often unrelated to global market conditions so the exporter commitment problem previously discussed is less relevant. Recent difficulties involving lags in food aid responses and mismatches between years when aid is plentiful and years when it is needed might be alleviated by such a reserve. On the other hand, care must be taken to minimize disincentives caused by the price-depressing effects of food distribution for the local farmers and merchants who are the first line of defense against famine for such countries 18 .",

One such mechanism, an international coordinated global food reserve, has recently been discussed.24  This reserve could help reassure importers that they could rely on exporters to supply them in time of need. The proposal is sketched as an agreement by members of a \"club\" that would include members of the G8+5 plus major grain exporters such as Argentina, Thailand, and Vietnam. The members would commit to holding specified amounts of public grain reserves in addition to reserves held by the private sector. The public stores would be used to intervene in the spot market as directed by a \"high level technical commission\" appointed by the club on a permanent basis. The commission would have full decision-making authority. Operation of this reserve would be coordinated with operation of a virtual reserve (see next section). This proposal has some features in common with the security provisions of the International Energy Agency for dealing with disruptions of petroleum markets. A major, and perhaps insurmountable, challenge for such a commitmentreinforcing program is to ensure commitment by the participants themselves to honor their obligations when markets are under stress.",

The concept, even when assuming it has been implemented as intended by Granger, is controversial from a philosophical viewpoint. Furthermore its implementation requires that all relevant information variables except the candidate cause be included. In Robles et al. only lags of own-price and a speculation proxy variable were included as determinants of the current price.The problem with missing information is illustrated by the following thought experiment. You see through your window a man walking past. He raises his umbrella. A minute later it starts to rain. If a sample is constructed using a number of instances like this, a Granger causality test including only rain and the raising of umbrellas could show umbrellas to be a significant cause of rain. Add other variables (thunder, for example) and the finding of causality of rain by the raising of umbrellas could be supplanted by a finding that thunder causes rain. Of course, neither finding demonstrates true causality. Likewise, in commodity markets, omission of relevant variables (candidates could be the closing of the Indian export market, new biofuel policy announcements, and weather changes) renders the results uninformative.",
