It is the first of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the World Bank's Twin Goals. Given this emphasis on poverty within the development community, it is important to accurately measure the number of poor people in the world and know where they live. Some of the most challenging issues regarding the estimation of global poverty concern the construction of the international poverty line (IPL)-which is derived from the national poverty lines of some of the poorest countries in the world )and the comparability of living standards across countries. The principal data that allow for the comparability of national poverty lines and different countries' living standards are purchasing power parities (PPPs). For this reason, the use of PPPs for the measurement of global poverty, and the revisions to PPPs over time, have been the subject of considerable debate (Deaton and Heston 2010; Ravallion 2014; Kakwani and Son 2016; .",

Differences between PPP rounds may not only reflect changes in real cost-of-living differences across countries over time but also ICP methodological changes across rounds. For example, the 2005 ICP round overstated price levels in most countries in the developing world, particularly owing to its approach of linking regional prices through \"ring\" countries . This contributed to increasing the estimated number of extremely poor people in the world by 400 million compared to the earlier 1993 PPPs ).",

In its response to the Commission, the World Bank left open the possibility that the 2017 PPPs would be adopted if the ICP methods and price data collection had stabilized (World Bank 2016).",

With the 2017 PPPs, we compute these lines to be approximately $3.65 and $6.85 per person per day.

Extreme poverty would decrease marginally by 0.2 percentage points (pp) in 2017 with the 2017 PPPs. Compared to past adoptions of new PPP rounds, this is a minor change. The global count of extreme poor reduces by 15 million, which is largely driven by 34 million fewer poor people in Sub-Saharan Africa, while poverty increases slightly in all other regions. However, Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest share of extreme poor in 2017; from 62% with the revised 2011 PPPs to 58% with the 2017 PPPs.

The distributions cover 168 economies that represent over 97% of the world's population. Some economies have more surveys than others depending on how often surveys are conducted. There is an average of 10 surveys for all economies spanning the period between 1991 and 2017, but more advanced economies are more likely to have annual distributions. For economies without annual data, annual poverty estimates are produced by extrapolating forward or backward from surveys, or interpolating between surveys, using national accounts growth rates and assuming no distributional changes (Prydz et al. 2019) .

PPP conversion factors are price indices that express the currency units of one country in terms of the currency units of a reference country, typically the United States. In other words, PPPs measure how much it costs to purchase a basket of goods and services in one country compared to how much it costs to purchase the same basket of goods and services in the United States.

For this, the ICP relies on the final expenditures classification on GDP from the System of National Accounts (SNA). While the 2005 and original 2011 rounds were based on the 1993 SNA, the revised 2011 and 2017 rounds are based on the 2008 SNA. This means that there has not been any drastic change in the classification of expenditures from the revised 2011 round to the 2017 round. \u2022 Second, the selection of the basket of goods and services that will be priced. This basket is based on the classification of expenditures mentioned above. Though the 2008 SNA were used for both the 2011 and 2017 rounds, a few changes have been introduced into the ICP expenditure classification at the basic-heading level. 7 Since only aggregate PPPs (e.g., household final consumption or GDP) are relevant for our purposes, these changes at the 7 Basic headings in the ICP nomenclature refer to detailed expenditure categories containing similar item varieties. For example, \"Rice\" basic heading contains several rice varieties. The changes at the basic-heading level are more structural than substantive (e.g., \"opening value of inventories\" and \"closing value of inventories\" in the 2011 round have been merged as \"changes in inventories\" in the 2017 round).",

While there was a major change in the method used in linking prices within and between regions from the \"ring\" method in 2005 to the \"Global Core List\" method in 2011, the computational steps followed to produce the final global PPPs have remained unchanged since the 2011 round. The Country Product Dummy (CPD) method is used to estimate PPPs at the basic-heading level, while the Gini, Eltet\u00f6 and K\u00f6ves and Szulc (GEKS) method is used to estimate aggregated PPPs, which are both transitive and base-country invariant. \u2022 Fourth, the participating countries. The calculation of a country's PPPs partially depends on other countries' PPPs. The number of participating countries declined from 199 to 176 between the 2011 and 2017 rounds, which is mostly explained by the dropping out of several small Pacific Islands. However, since they were linked to the other participating economies via three bridge-countries (i.e., selected countries which additionally collect prices on a range of items from another region)-Australia (Eurostat-OECD), Fiji (Asia and the Pacific), and New Zealand (Eurostat-OECD)-the inclusion of these islands did not impact the global results. \u2022 Fifth, the spatial coverage of ICP price collection. The spatial coverage may vary over time within countries. In the 2005 round, for instance, price survey outlets were predominantly in capital cities and urban areas (World Bank 2008) . In India, 74% of prices were collected from urban areas in the 2011 round, while 64% of prices were collected from urban areas in the 2017 round. In OECD countries prices have been largely collected from urban areas in both rounds. These differences do not necessarily imply overestimation or underestimation of national prices, as the ICP requests countries to submit nationally representative prices. 8 Under the assumption that countries submit nationally representative prices, changes to this component do not affect the stability of the 2011 and 2017 PPPs. The absence of documentation of what countries do makes it difficult to assess whether this is indeed the case.",

Deviations are expected from such a comparison, because of conceptual and estimation differences between CPIs and PPPs. Substantial, systematic deviations could, however, suggest issues with the PPPs, as shown with previous rounds. For example, use this to show that the ICP overstated prices in the 2005 round, especially in developing countries, which was reversed in the 2011 round. Figure 1 shows that the ratio of actual 2017 PPPs to 2017 PPPs extrapolated from the 2005 round is systematically lower than 1, while the ratio of actual 2017 PPPs to 2017 PPPs extrapolated from the revised 2011 round is more uniformly distributed around a mean of almost 1. The revised 2011 PPPs can better predict the 2017 PPPs. This is consistent with stability between the 2011 and 2017 PPPs, especially when compared with the 2005 PPPs. .

This might result from different factors causing large changes in PPPs and/or CPIs. For example, changes in PPPs can arise from: (i) geographical changes in ICP price collection (with an imperfect adjustment to national average prices); or (ii) changes in the share of items in the ICP price survey for which prices were actually collected (for example, Angola priced 18% of items in the 2011 round which almost doubled to 35% in the 2017 round). Furthermore, the 2017 ICP round has benefited from technological advances that have reportedly improved data quality assurance across all regions (World Bank 2020b). It is also important to note that the extrapolation of different PPPs to a common year requires the use of national CPIs, which may have measurement issues, such as following non-standard consumption classifications, or using expenditure weights and baskets that are outdated or not nationally representative (Berry et al. 2019) . summarized the changes in PPPs and CPIs using the delta ratio. The delta ratio is the ratio of the relative change in CPI between 2011 and 2017 to the relative change in PPP between 2011 and 2017. It equals the ratio of the PPP-denominated mean income levels, and is thus closely related to the change in poverty. 9 See Appendix E, section 9 for the derivation of the delta ratio. 2017 is income in 2017 PPPs and 2011 is income in (revised) 2011 PPPs.",

For Angola, with a delta ratio of 1.80, the same bundle of goods and services in Angola that would cost $1.00 in 2011 (converted by 2011 PPP into LCU) would cost $1.80 in 2017 (converted by 2017 PPP into LCU).

In the absence of a definitive conclusion on which PPP is appropriate, we believe using the averages of the official and imputed PPPs for these eight countries provides the most robust PPPs. 14 We use extrapolated 2017 PPPs for a few other exception countries that do not have official 2017 PPPs, including Kiribati, Nauru, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tuvalu, the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, and the Republic of Yemen. 15 We conduct sensitivity analysis to understand the extent to which the alternative PPPs influence the IPL and extreme poverty estimates. The IPL remains robust to alternative PPPs and global and regional trends are virtually unaffected by the alternative PPPs (see Figure D .4). Global extreme poverty would decline by 0.4pp (instead of 0.2pp) in 2017 if the official 2017 PPPs were used throughout (see Table D .7). This change is largely driven by Sub-Saharan Africa (particularly Nigeria) and the Middle East & North Africa (particularly Egypt).",

Hence, increasing the sample to more than 15 countries might induce greater statistical support. Third, using national poverty lines constructed primarily in the 1990s for setting global poverty lines for measuring poverty today would rely heavily on CPI series over a long period of time from countries with typically weak statistical capacity.

This yields national poverty lines expressed in per capita PPP terms for all countries.

The idea behind this method is to estimate the IPL with the 2017 PPPs by choosing a line that retains the global poverty rate in a pre-specified reference year. For example, the equivalent poverty line could be set to keep constant the global poverty rate in 2010, the year that had the most recent global poverty estimate when the World Bank's goal of ending extreme poverty was set. This method is attractive in light of the Atkinson Commission Report, which was concerned with future ICP rounds shifting the goalposts (World Bank, 2017). With this approach, the parameter of choice is then the year in which poverty should be held constant, for which several options appear reasonable. For example, this could be 2012, which is the year with the most recent global poverty estimate when the UN agreed on the SDGs. It could also be 2015, the year that had the most recent global poverty estimate when Atkinson wrote his report. Finally, we include the 2017 reference year in the analysis, which is the year with the latest global poverty numbers at the time of writing. See Appendix E, section 6 for the derivation of equivalent poverty lines. Table 2 presents the results of the analysis described above. 20 The equivalent IPL that retains the global poverty rate rounds to $2.15 (2017 PPP) regardless of which of the four reference years is selected. 21 Our preferred year for evaluating the equivalent IPL is 2017, which is both the latest ICP reference year and the year with the latest global poverty data. The equivalent IPL for 2017 is $2.173. E. Robustness check: Using the approach of For completeness, let us also state that if we were to use the 15 national poverty lines selected by and further applied by , convert them to 2017 PPPs, and take the average, we would end up with an IPL of $2.08 (see Table B .9. in Appendix B for details).

        "text": "Jolliffe and Prydz subsample by country type to try to exclude countries with relative poverty lines. As a preferred alternative to this, we have collected metadata on type of poverty line from most countries and subsample on all countries that have absolute poverty lines. (The original objective of selecting SPL parameters was to demonstrate an empirical relationship between absolute poverty lines and level of economic wellbeing in a country.) Table 3 shows the estimated intercept and slope coefficients when considering three such specifications. We first consider a sample (n=119) where we have one observation for each country with an absolute poverty line. For each country, we select the observation which is closest in time to 2017 (and refer to this as our circa-2017 sample). We then consider the subsample of all (n=815) country-year observations, allowing multiple observations per country capturing some within-country variation over time in their values. We use two different weighting schemes, where in both cases we ensure that all countries are weighted equally, but in one specification, we weight more heavily the data points that are closer in time to 2017 (see table notes for details). Across these three specifications, the intercept ranges from 1.15 to 1.17 (in 2017 PPPs). While that variation is not substantial, it's noteworthy that these are very imprecisely estimated parameters with 95 percent confidence intervals that are almost $1 in width (e.g., $1.15 \u00b1 $0.49 for the circa-2017 sample). For the circa-2017 sample, the standard error is $0.25 but this drops only a few cents when considering sample sizes that are nearly seven-fold larger. 22 Notes: Using the same model specification in Jolliffe and Prydz (2021) and the new data used in updating the absolute poverty lines in this paper (Table 1 , panel C), the parameters are updated with the 2017 PPPs. This table excludes all national poverty lines that are defined as relative lines (which is typical of high-income countries). For the circa-2017 sample, every country with an absolute poverty line is included but only for the year that is closest to the 2017 ICP benchmark year. In the larger samples (n=815), the weighting schemes differ. In one scheme, every observation has a weight equal to the inverse of the total number of observations for each country, so that each country has a sum of weights equal to 1. In the other scheme, we weight the observations to give greater importance to those close to 2017 and to give equal weight to each country: In the first step, we assign a survey conducted in 2017 a weight of 1, a survey conducted in 2016 or 2018 a weight of 1/2, a survey conducted in 2015 or 2019 a weight of 1/3, and so on. Next, we rescale the weights to ensure that the sum of weights for each country is again equal to 1. For example, if a country has three harmonized poverty lines for 2016, 2017, and 2018, the corresponding weights will be 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25. All parameter estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. Standard errors of the estimates are in parentheses.",

We use this complementary approach to assess the sensitivity of the estimated intercept. Part of the reason why the confidence intervals around the intercept are so large is because the intercept is an out-of-sample prediction. The intercept essentially represents a minimum cost of basic needs under which no person could survive, no matter how poor a particular country is. No country provides a direct estimate of this value; we can only infer it if we impose modelling assumptions. This is conceptually very different from how we approached updating the IPL which reflects a median value over a large sample of national poverty lines and is a well-supported, within-sample estimate. The alternative method considered is to update the intercept based on the delta ratio, first discussed in Section 3.B. The delta ratio, unique to each country, directly converts 2011 PPP values for each country into 2017 PPP values. For the subsample of countries that use absolute poverty lines (i.e., those countries used in this analysis), Table 3 reports an average value of the delta ratio of 1.15.

Figure B .2 shows that the average delta ratio by income group is decreasing in income, and the delta ratio for low-income countries on average exceeds 1.13.

While there are obviously changes in rankings within the region, African countries are actually quite evenly split between increasing and decreasing poverty: Extreme poverty is lower with the 2017 PPPs in 24 countries and higher in 21 countries, with most countries being quite stable (see Figure B.4) .

Though we have changed the method by which we derived the IPL-we now use the harmonized national poverty line approach to update the IPL, similar to what is used for the higher lines-we can abstract from this methodological change since this approach also resulted in a $1.90 poverty line with the 2011 PPPs (Jolliffe and Prydz 2016).",

As we argued in Section 4.A, this generates an IPL of $2.15, meaning that our revision to the IPL can entirely be explained by the new PPPs, regardless of the other factors. For the poverty line typical of lower-middle-income countries, we arrive at a poverty line of $3.68, quite close to the final one when accounting for all changes ($3.63), meaning that nearly all of the updates to that line can be explained by the changes to PPPs. For the line typical of upper-middle-income countries, revising only the PPPs brings the line to $6.32, quite far from the final line ($6.85) meaning that the PPP changes cannot explain all of the increase of that line.",

This has small impacts on the IPL and the lower-middle-income line, but increases the upper-middle-income line notably, from $6.32 to $7.15. Thus, the relatively high increase in the upper-middle-income line is partially driven by real upward shifts in the national poverty lines of upper-middle-income countries. Part of this can be explained by some of these countries now being high-income countries, but even when removing those countries, the line still sits at $6.95 (see Table B .16 for more details). This might be because poverty in upper-middle-income countries is more likely to reflect the concept of relative poverty, which changes over time with consumption patterns and incomes, rather than prices, which are more relevant for absolute poverty (Smeeding 2016) . The fact that we now have national poverty lines and welfare aggregates for more countries than only has a minimal impact on the value of the global lines.",

This means that we would expect the national poverty lines close to 2017 to be higher in real terms than the national poverty lines close to 2011. How is this consistent with our finding that the real value of the IPL and lower-middle-income line is purely driven by PPPs and not by changes to the real value of national poverty lines? The answer lies in the use of income groups to define the global poverty lines. Suppose a poor country grew between the release of the 2011 PPPs and 2017 PPPs and as a consequence adopted a higher national poverty line. Suppose further that the country graduated from being a low-income country to a lower-middle income country as a result of this growth. Then it is not obvious that the increase in the real value of their national poverty line will increase the median national poverty line of low-income countries or lower-middle income countries. As long as the median income level within each income group has not changed between 2011 and 2017, then-even if countries' national poverty lines increase as they grow-it does not need to be the case that the global poverty lines we derive on expectation increase in real value.",

While the changes at the upper-middle-income line are larger, the 2017 PPPs have small implications for extreme poverty and poverty at the lower-middle-income line. Between 1991 to 2017, extreme poverty in the world falls from 36.05% to 9.27% with the revised 2011 PPPs, and from 37.46% to 9.07% with the 2017 PPPs.

See Appendix E, section 1 for the derivations. Notes: This table compares extreme poverty between the original and revised 2011 PPPs at the global and regional levels. Extreme poverty is measured as the share of the population living below the international poverty line, which is $1.90/day. Notes: Panel (A) uses the same implicit national poverty lines originally derived by . Panel (B) and (C) pool together the implicit national poverty lines that we have derived. Our total sample of implicit poverty lines is 1,381, but 7 lines from the 1980s drop out because they could not be matched into the World Bank's historical income classification, which begins from 1988. Panels (B) and (C) provide weighted medians and means for countryyear observations based on the income classification in the year in which the surveys were conducted. We weight the observations to give greater importance to those close to 2017 and to give equal weight to each country: In the first step, we assign a survey conducted in 2017 a weight of 1, a survey conducted in 2016 or 2018 a weight of 1/2, a survey conducted in 2015 or 2019 a weight of 1/3, and so on. Secondly, we rescale the weights such that each country has a total weight of 1. For example, if a country has three harmonized poverty lines for 2016, 2017, and 2018, the corresponding weights will be 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25. The weights are based on the relevant data set (N = 1,374) or subsample in question (N = 889). The sample in panel (A) has one harmonized national poverty for each country, so each country has a weight of 1 (there are 126 countries in panel (A), 157 in panel (B), and 150 in panel (C)). The oldest lines (n = 2) in panel (A) are from 2001 (i.e., 10 years before the 2011 ICP reference year). Panel (C) includes only lines since 2007 (i.e., 10 years before the 2017 ICP). When one line is selected for each country from the most recent lines (since 2007), the proposed international poverty line would be $2.14 (see Table B .7 below). Notes: Panel (A) replicates Panel (C) from Table 1 in the main text. The line that is closest to 2017 is selected, one for each country. If harmonized national poverty lines are available for 2016 and 2018 but not 2017, 2018 is selected. Panel (B) excludes 7 lines derived from surveys conducted more than 10 years before the 2017 ICP reference year: AZE2001, COM2004, JAM2004, KIR2006, SYR2003, UZB2003, VEN2006. Notes: This table shows equivalent poverty lines in column (3) that keep the global and regional poverty headcount ratios in column (2) constant in a pre-specified reference year (year given in column (1)). The results for the world in column (3) are presented in the main text in Table 2 . Column (5) provides an alternative approach, where the equivalent international poverty line for the world is calculated as the weighted average of the regional equivalent poverty lines (in column (3)), with the weights being the regions' respective shares of total millions of poor in column (4). The weights are based on the revised 2011 PPPs (with a $1.90 poverty line). . Column (2) updates both PPPs and CPIs to the 2017 ICP reference year, while incorporating the revisions to the CPI data used in deriving the $1.90 line. Column (3) updates both PPPs and CPIs to the 2017 ICP reference year, without incorporating the revisions to CPI data used in deriving the $1.90 line. Column (4) takes the $1.90 line as given for all countries and updates the $1.90 line with both PPPs and updated CPIs to the 2017 reference year. See Appendix E, section 2 for the derivations. If we updated the IPL with US inflation between 2011 and 2017 (i.e., approximately 9%), the new IPL would be $2.07.

For countries, without a survey in 2017, the estimates are based on extrapolations or interpolations from recent surveys. Extreme poverty is measured using the IPL of $1.9 (revised 2011 PPP) or $2.15 (2017 PPP). Marker size is proportional to absolute change in millions of poor. The dotted line is a 45-degree line. The overall methodology for selecting the basket of goods and services the ICP collects prices on has remained quite stable. The ICP relies on sampling theory to determine the number of products to be priced in each basic heading, the number of survey outlets, and the number of times surveys will be conducted in the reference year. For example, only 10-15 items may be priced for the rice basic heading while 70-100 items may be priced for the more heterogeneous garments basic heading to obtain a similar level of precision in the estimates for the basic-headings PPPs (World Bank 2013). The exact items that are priced, as well as where or when surveys are exactly conducted, are subject to expert advice ex-ante and validation ex-post. The list of items also requires at least partial updates for each comparison (e.g., IT equipment, cars, home entertainment, etc.). In the 2005 round, there was a separate price and expenditure survey with a \"ring\" list of 1,000 items that were priced in 18 selected \"ring\" countries across all regions, to link prices within and across regions. The ring list of items has been found to have a bias for traded goods, which are often unrepresentative, scarce, and expensive in developing countries . As a result, the 2005 round overstated price levels in most developing countries. The lessons learned from the 2005 round brought about significant improvements in ICP product specification. In subsequent rounds, the list of items in the price surveys conducted in all participating economies has been carefully chosen to ensure that the items are both representative within countries and comparable across countries, as best as possible (World Bank 2013; 2015; 2020). A global core list (GCL) of items is priced as part of the price and expenditure surveys, for linking prices within and across regions. The GCL items are marked as \"important\" or \"less important\" and prices are weighted accordingly, so that price levels in developing countries are not overstated. Each country decides its own sets of important and less important items, depending on their national consumption patterns. Also, importance indicators apply only within basic headings, not across. While the general approach of obtaining the price and expenditure data remains similar, especially between the 2011 and 2017 rounds, data quality assurance has been improved with the latest available technology, particularly in the 2017 round (World Bank 2020).",

At the global level, the Country Product Dummy (CPD) method is used to estimate PPPs. This method estimates a regression model that produces in one step PPPs that are both transitive and base-country invariant. The resulting PPPs are multilateral (i.e., the basic-heading PPPs for one economy depend on those of all other participating economies). PPPs are calculated for countries within regions, first at the basic heading level using the Country Product Dummy (CPD) method and then at the aggregate level using the Gini, Eltet\u00f6 and K\u00f6ves, and Szulc (GEKS) method, using prices in the GCL and a regional list, and expressed in the currency of a reference country in the region. Finally, the PPPs are linked across regions solely using items in the GCL to produce the global PPPs, expressed in US dollars, in a way that ensures regional fixity (i.e., the ratio of real expenditures between any pair of participating economies within a region remains the same after linking prices across regions).",

In practice, however, the total number of countries participating is less of an issue due to the regional fixity principle. In particular, the differences in country coverage between the 2011 and 2017 rounds mainly come from small Pacific Islands (e.g., Cook Islands and Kiribati) that participated in the 2011 round. However, since these countries were linked via three bridge-countries that participated from other regions-Australia (Eurostat-OECD), Fiji (Asia and the Pacific), and New Zealand (Eurostat-OECD)-the inclusion of these islands did not impact the rest of the countries in any manner. Overall, comparability of different ICP rounds may still be an issue in cases where countries move regions (e.g., Colombia and Costa Rica have been moved from Latin America and the Caribbean to OECD in the 2017 round) or where countries join or drop from the comparison altogether.",

In the 2017 round, this is still the case in some countries, including many high-income countries. Survey frames do not necessarily imply overestimation or underestimation of national prices, as the ICP requests countries to submit nationally representative annual prices. However, the ICP acknowledges that national average prices are often hard to achieve in large economies with settlements and populations that are substantially rural (World Bank 2015), and ultimately the ICP does not know whether prices have been adjusted appropriately.",

Given that no information can cast definite doubt on the 2017 PPPs-if so, the ICP team would have dealt with the issue already-each of these criteria provides a signal of evidence on whether the 2017 PPPs are fit for global poverty monitoring. a) Are the CPIs fit for purpose? As described in the main text, an extreme delta ratio could arise from issues with either PPP or the CPI. We evaluate the quality of the CPI by whether it classifies expenditures using COICOP, and whether the weights have national coverage and are no older than 10 years from 2017. If none of these issues applies, we do not have evidence that there is a problem with the CPIs, which may suggest that the problem could be with the PPPs, creating an argument for imputing PPPs (see Table D .2). priced in the 2017 round against the 2011 round. For countries in red, the log difference in the share of items priced in 2011 and 2017 is more than two standard deviations from the mean (evaluated over all countries, not just the ones plotted). Among the countries identified above, only Angola shows up as an outlier by this criterion. In Angola, the share of items priced almost doubles between the two rounds, which is an improvement. None of the countries under consideration has a large decline in the share of items priced. c) Does the imputed PPP make the poverty rate more consistent with related indicators that do not rely on PPPs, such as the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) ",

The conceptual framework of the ICP methodology is centered around the SNA's definition of GDP from the expenditure side; the sum of final expenditures on consumption, gross capital formation, and net exports (World Bank 2013; 2020). The most recent ICP rounds were based on different versions of the SNA: the 2005 and original 2011 rounds were based on the 1993 SNA, whereas the revised 2011 and 2017 rounds were based on the 2008 SNA. Even though both versions share the same fundamental structure, the 2008 SNA introduced some changes to the 1993 SNA (OECD 2013; World Bank 2020). These changes have implications for GDP, either by re-allocating components and/or changing the level of GDP. For example, research and development (R&D) has been capitalized for the first time, which has two implications: (1) it re-classifies R&D from government final consumption expenditure to government gross fixed capital formation, and (2) it adds to the level of GDP via the cost of depreciation that has to be imputed and included (OECD 2013). 29 A few changes have been introduced into the ICP expenditure classification in the 2017 round at different levels of aggregation, mainly in light of the SNA changes. The ICP classifies expenditure and price data as main aggregates, categories, groups, classes, and basic headings, in descending order. 30 For example, gross capital formation is a new main aggregate of GDP that now combines two main aggregates in the (original) 2011 round (i.e., gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and acquisitions less disposal of valuables). Even though there are still 155 basic headings in the 2017 round as in the 2011 round, some basic headings have been merged (e.g., opening value of inventories and closing value of inventories in the 2011 round have been merged as changes in inventories in the 2017 round) and new ones have been added (e.g., actual and imputed rentals for housing was a basic heading in the 2011 round but is now separated as actual rentals for housing and imputed rentals for housing under the housing rentals category). A key point to note is that aggregation is done from the level of basic headings up to the desired aggregate (e.g., GDP, household final consumption, or other levels) so that all these changes at the level of basic headings do not have a significant impact on the aggregates. Apart from changes in national accounts structures caused by SNA revisions, national accounts expenditure data of countries get routinely revised or rebased to incorporate new information. This primarily explains the revisions to the original 2011 PPPs.",
