  "abstract": "Contrary to the prevailing view that the Doha negotiations have achieved little, we find that on trade facilitation much progress has been made. This is particularly true in regard to action by development banks and bilateral development agencies to meet client demand for assistance in reform. Active private sector participation has been an important factor driving change. Many agencies have been involved in this work; we find that their roles have been consistent with their comparative advantages. As to how the international community can best support continued progress, we conclude in favor of a cautious approach to the imposition of new WTO obligations in the area of trade facilitation. On the whole, this is the approach the WTO has taken, e.g., by limiting its negotiations on trade facilitation to several specific provisions of the GATT. The WTO can continue to function as a catalyst for reform; it is perhaps uniquely placed to relate the trade facilitation agenda to the overall trade agenda. On design and construction of the relevant infrastructures and capacities to spur development, the development institutions, including bilateral agencies, should continue to lead. We find little evidence to support the need for a comprehensive new \"platform\" or mechanism to channel trade-related aid as part of implementation of any new agreement at the WTO on trade facilitation. We recommend, however, that an innovative approach to using the well established, but under utilized Trade Policy Review Mechanism be considered to increase transparency on where new aid is going over time and to expand understanding of where and how country-based progress has been achieved. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3971, August 2006 The Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues. An objective of the series is to get the findings out quickly, even if the presentations are less than fully polished. The papers carry the names of the authors and should be cited accordingly.

In this exploration we pay particular attention to trade facilitation. 6 It is the only \"new area\" in the agenda and the only place the negotiations have taken up the challenge to tailor obligations to particular conditions and of tying the legal obligation to implement WTO rules to a concrete commitment to provide assistance. Moreover, trade facilitation involves activities such as transport, communications and public service efficiency that are economy-wide in scope. Thus the trade facilitation discussion does take up the issue of how regulating their trade dimension can guide construction of institutions basic to the domestic economy.",

We look into the details of progress on trade facilitation in order to learn more about how the contributions of the different organizations fit together. This part of our work was in part sparked by a Japanese contribution to the WTO 7 discussion that brought forward the idea that institutions have comparative advantages, their different structures and capacities should be taken into account in determining which of the international community's different instruments are best suited to different parts of the development challenge. 8 As to our findings, contrary to the pervading view that the Doha negotiations have achieved little, we find that on trade facilitation much progress has been made, particularly through development banks and bilateral development agencies.

As to what developing Members received, the newly tariffied schedules of protection of agriculture proved to be hardly less restrictive than the hodgepodge of non-tariff measures they replaced. The commitment to remove quantitative restrictions on imports of textiles and clothing would take place mostly at the end of the 10-year phase-in period, not at the beginning. Moreover and less often noted, the economics of TRIPS (the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property) dominates the economics of the Uruguay Round Agreements. For the United States and other intellectual property providers, the value of the claims TRIPS generates is several times larger than the gain to them from all the merchandise trade liberalization agreed, including the liberalization of their own restrictions. For countries that mostly use intellectual property established elsewhere, the TRIPS-generated obligation to pay is several times larger than the gains they will enjoy from the Uruguay Round package of merchandise import liberalization. 10 Thus there emerged a concern that the basic GATT/WTO ethic of reciprocity or balance had been violated -developing Members had given more than they got.",

The Hong Kong Ministerial asks that the round be completed in calendar 2006. World Bank experience shows that even after project identification, the process of project design and appraisal usually requires 18 months to complete. (Table 4 .1. provides the timetable for a recently completed project.) Moreover, project identification and preparation presupposes the existence of an overall development strategy (for poorer countries, a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper). Also in the background will be a Country Assistance Strategy, CAS. The CAS, produced by the Bank in co-operation with the government and stakeholders in the country, outlines out a program of Bank Group support linked to the country's development strategy. 22 Given the platform to do so collectively does not yet exist and there is small likelihood that any Member will offer implementation audits for its proposals, the realistic alternatives must therefore accept that the rules or standards written into a Doha Development Agenda agreement will be unaudited when the agreement goes into effect.

Shipping manifests and customs declarations are sent over the network, thereby reducing processing time. The manifest data for Customs is also available to the cargo handling operator in electronic format, eliminating data capture by the latter and improving planning and operational processes. TTN provides a flexible user interface: Trade professionals (customs brokers, freight forwarders, ship agents, etc\u2026) use client based applications that are designed to handle processing of large numbers of transactions whereas occasional users can opt for a web-based interface.",

Electronic processing has cut that time to within one or two days. Payment of customs duties, storage duties, and port duties now takes only a few hours, rather than a full day.

This was made possible in Tunisia by close involvement of the Minister of Commerce, who was also the chairman of the Superior Export and Investment Council, a cross-ministerial committee reporting directly to the President of Tunisia. The second success factor was the cooperation among private sector operators and various government stakeholders at all stages of the process. This was achieved by setting a steering committee and a technical committee composed of key stakeholders at the early stages of the process.
