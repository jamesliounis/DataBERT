From 1980 to 2010, partially fill the gap in research on Morocco and provide policy makers with critical, useful information. By highlighting the main constraints to equality among young children, this information can help in identifying vulnerable children and in gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon as a whole. We draw on the concept of inequality of opportunity and methods for quantifying unequal opportunities (de Barros, Ferreira, Vega, & Chanduvi, 2009; de Barros, Vega, & Saavedra, 2008; Deutsch & Silber, 2008; Roemer, 1998 Roemer, , 2014 Shorrocks, 2013) to assess inequality in ECD. We demonstrate a number of challenges in terms of unequal early health and survival, nutrition, and social-emotional and cognitive development. Overall, we find that while there have been some improvements in ECD, particularly in health, substantial inequalities and deficits persist. These inequalities and deficits in ECD will affect children into their adult lives and present a substantial barrier to ensuring shared prosperity and adult equality in Morocco. More must be done to ensure children have equitable opportunities to develop and thrive.",

Initially, a sample size of 8,094 households was planned to ensure representativeness across the country in each area of residence (urban, rural) and even at the level of certain regions. An average size of 25 households per cluster was also targeted. Among the households selected, 7,931 were actually interviewed, yielding a response rate of 98 percent.

This paper focuses on ECD in terms of health and survival; nutrition; and children's social, emotional, and cognitive development from the time when a child is still in the womb until the child is five years old (the age of school entry in Morocco). Twelve different indicators (see Box 1) are used to assess the status of ECD in Morocco, its evolution over time, and the extent of inequality in ECD. These indicators were selected due to their important contributions to ECD while keeping in mind the limitations of the data. For instance, while we would ideally be measuring cognitive development directly, such data are not captured in national surveys in Morocco. For this reason, we examine important inputs to cognitive development such as early childhood care and education, and parents' engagement in development activities.",

Being malnourished-for instance, being stunted-leads to deficits in cognitive development, poorer performance in school, worse health as an adult, and lower productivity and wages in the labor market (Glewwe & Miguel, 2008; Grantham-McGregor, Cheung, Cueto, et al., 2007; Walker, Wachs, Grantham-McGregor, et al., 2011) .

Although the types of assets that are measured varies by survey and the nature of wealth has evolved over the decade studied, similar inputs enter into the wealth quintiles used across surveys.

Region of residence reveals the regional disparities that have an impact on the various socioeconomic indicators of the population. To ensure that the outcomes of the various surveys used are comparable and to compensate for the finite sample size of a number of surveys, we grouped the data retaining the old breakdown into seven regions based on the distribution of the sample from each survey, in accordance with the different regions in the country.

        "text": "Nutrition In addition to facing different chances of early health care and even early death, children face unequal chances of healthy growth and nutrition depending on their backgrounds. Table 2 , in the annex, presents the full set of relationships between nutrition and children's background. Notably, there are substantial disparities in nutrition by wealth ( Figure 6 ). As of 2011, 28 percent of the poorest children were stunted compared to 7 percent of the richest. The poorest children have also made the least progress over time; they have had relatively lower reductions in their chances of being stunted. In addition to differences by wealth, there are substantial disparitiesdepending on where children live and their parents' education-for stunting and other nutrition outcomes. Location acutely affects children's chances of living in a household that uses adequately iodized salt and, therefore, being protected against cognitive deficits. As Figure 7 shows, rates range from 3 percent in Tensfit to 25 percent in North Central. Additionally, there are large differences by rural-urban residence, wealth, and parents' education. These factors are interrelated. For instance, families that are less wealthy are also less educated. Table 3 ). These differences will lead to persistent disparities in adult life, including in school and in the labor market. There has been mixed progress in reducing inequality over time in these dimensions of development. Children's chances of experiencing development activities are closely linked to their backgrounds and poverty is increasingly a risk factor for poor development (Figure 8 ). While in 2006/07 around 35 percent of the poorest children and 68 percent of the richest children experienced development activities, this dropped to 16 percent for the poorest and 58 percent for the richest in 2011. Differences by residence, region, and parents' education also occur and gaps along these dimensions have mostly been increasing over time. Although disparities in development activities have been increasing over time, disparities in ECCE attendance have been decreasing. Figure 9 shows differences in ECCE attendance by mother's education over time; those whose mothers have no education is the only group that has seen an increase in attendance, from 34 percent to 45 percent. They still lag far behind those whose mothers are more educated, although disparities by education, wealth, urban versus rural, and region have been decreasing. Two other areas of concern are violent child discipline and work (including domestic work). There are some disparities by background in both these outcomes. For instance, children from richer families are less likely to be violently disciplined but somewhat more likely to engage in work and domestic work. It is not possible to assess the change in the impact of different characteristics over time because data are not available on these outcomes from any years other than 2006/07.",

        "text": "Health and Survival Young children in Morocco face widely disparate development opportunities in terms of health and survival. Inequality in access to early health care remains substantial. Around 7-8 percent of the opportunities for prenatal and delivery care would have to have been distributed differently for equality of opportunity to have prevailed in 2012. However, these levels are substantially lower (by more than half) compared to 2003/04 ( Figure 10 ). There has been a slight increase in inequality in immunizations and infant mortality inequality is quite low; both outcomes potentially having disparities due to chance (not statistically significant). These inequalities translate into very different chances for the most and least advantaged children in society (Figure 11 ). The most advantaged child is almost certain to have good early health outcomes-nearly 100 percent chances of prenatal care, delivery care, and immunizations and a low chance of infant mortality. In contrast, as of 2012, the least advantaged child has only a 54 percent chance of prenatal care, a 40 percent chance of skilled delivery, a 65 percent chance of full immunization, and a 2.2 percent chance of dying in the first year of life. With the exception of immunizations, there have been improvements over time in the least advantaged children's prospects, but gaps remain large. 4.3.2 Nutrition Inequality in nutrition in terms of being stunted, underweight, and wasted is low and has not increased over time (Figure 12) . Differences in some years are likely due to chance (not statistically significant). Although only one year of data is available (so we are unable to assess trends), the level of inequality in access to adequately iodized salt is very high. For children to have equal chances, 30 percent of the opportunities to access adequately iodized salt would have to be redistributed. Looking at the factors contributing to inequality, wealth matters a great deal, specifically for stunting and access to iodized salt, and urban/rural differences also contribute substantially to inequality, along with regional differences. As is the case across outcomes, gender differences contribute relatively little to inequality. Although overall there are no great inequalities in malnutrition, children do have very different chances of being stunted, underweight, or wasted depending on their circumstances. Looking at 2011, the least advantaged child has a 33 percent chance of being stunted, compared to a 5 percent chance for the most advantaged. Likewise in 2006/07, the least advantaged child has a 1 percent chance of access to adequately iodized salt compared to a 38 percent chance for the most advantaged child. These are large disparities in healthy physical growth and nutrition early in life for children with different circumstances. (Figure 14) . As of 2006/07, the inequality (as measured by the dissimilarity index) was 34 percent of opportunities needing to be redistributed for ECCE, 14 percent for development activities, 30 percent for violent child discipline, and 5 percent for work at age five (including domestic work). By 2012, inequality fell for ECCE. However, inequality for development activities had risen by 2011. No data are available for comparing violent discipline or work (including domestic work) over time. Children have very different chances of successful early social, emotional, and cognitive development for the most and least advantaged (Figure 15 ). Overall, in Morocco, the most advantaged children benefit most from early childhood care and education, which naturally has implications for inequality in school and then during adulthood. In 2012, the least advantaged child had a 45 percent chance of ECCE compared to a 95 percent chance for the most advantaged. This represents an improvement from 2006/07 to 2012. Disparities in development activities increased, with the most advantaged child having a 79 percent chance of development activities in 2011 compared to 18 percent for the least advantaged. The least advantaged child is almost guaranteed of being violently disciplined (99 percent) while the most advantaged child has a substantial but lower chance (74 percent). The chances of work (including domestic work) are slightly higher for the most advantaged (16 percent) than the least advantaged (8 percent). This reversal is notable for its rarity among all the outcomes. ",

While the contributions of different background characteristics vary over time and across the measures of ECD, a number of consistent patterns stand out. First, wealth contributes substantially and the role of wealth in inequality appears to have been rising slightly over time. Mother's education also plays an important role in inequality, although less so in nutrition inequality than other dimensions of inequality. Father's education contributes to inequality but less so than mother's education. Regional and urban/rural differences contribute to inequality, often substantially, but to varying degrees across indicators.

In 2012, 36-37 percent of the inequality in prenatal and delivery care was due to wealth and 21-25 percent due to mother's education. Father's education plays a decreasing role in health inequalities. In nutrition, wealth has increasingly played a role in children being stunted, underweight, and wasted over time, with shares as high as 45 percent for stunting in 2011. Little of the inequalities in nutrition are due to the mother's or father's education. There are declining contributions to disparities from different regions but slight increases in urban-rural contributions. Wealth plays an increasing role in ECCE (40 percent in 2012) and development activities (30 percent in 2011), with mixed patterns for mother's and father's education (13-18 percent). Urban-rural disparities are particularly large contributors to inequality in ECCE (39 percent in 2012) and development activities (35 percent in 2011). Regional disparities make particularly large contributions to inequality in work, including domestic work (36 percent) at age five and violent discipline (51 percent). These different contributing factors can help policymakers target groups particularly at risk for disparities and understand some of the mechanisms contributing to inequality in ECD. For instance, the substantial wealth but limited regional contributions to health inequality suggest that affordability of health care is a greater constraint than unequal local access.",

For example, Madagascar achieved a dramatic increase in coverage of iodized salt in just four years, going from 0 percent of households in 1995 to 98 percent of households in 1999. The key requirements for a successful scale-up include raising awareness on iodine deficiency, its consequences, and the importance of iodized salt; ensuring access to a supply of adequately iodized salt; and enforcement and compliance in the salt industry through monitoring and enforcement of iodization standards. Awareness raising can involve standard information campaigns about iodine deficiency and iodized salt, including radio, television, traditional drama, teachers, and community health volunteers. Enforcement and compliance can include aligning incentives for salt producers, monitoring and testing of salt producers, and publicized 'check-and-seize' operations to confiscate non-iodized salt (Goh, 2002) .",

All children under two years of age in the community are eligible to participate. 24 According to a quasi-experimental impact evaluation between 2010 and 2012, the AIN-C program resulted in a 6.7 percentage point reduction in stunting for children under two years of age exposed to the program for two years.

Recognizing that most young parents do not have the knowledge or skills to provide a stimulating home environment or promote social and emotional development, Jordan developed the Better Parenting project. The project targeted disadvantaged families and was implemented through partnerships between UNICEF and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Topics covered included child development and the role of the family, positive discipline, and the importance of play. During its early years, the program struggled to reach fathers. Mosques were identified as an ideal place to connect with fathers and the community, and so the program reached out to the religious community. An Imam Guide on ECD was produced and used to train imams and khatibs (mosque preachers) on how to teach about better parenting during or after Friday prayers. The guide emphasized ways parents can actively support their children's development, especially the role of fathers. This outreach approach engaged communities and parents and substantially increased the participation of men in Better Parenting (UNICEF, 2009) . The most successful parenting programs have been found to be those with systematic training methods, a structured curriculum, opportunities for parents to practice activities with their children and receive feedback, and good relationships between parents and trainers. Long duration did not necessarily produce better results (Engle, Fernald, Alderman, et al., 2011) .",

A number of countries have shown success using this approach.

The program has shown positive results; dropouts fell by 57 percent, the re-registration after dropping out increased by 37 percent, and student achievement in math improved (World Bank, 2011b) . For Tayssir to have a greater impact on ECD outcomes, the CCT could address the needs of younger children. For example, receipt of the transfer could be conditioned on participation in health and nutrition activities, regular parenting education sessions, and/or preschool attendance (either formal or community preschools). The government could also commit to using mass media to promote awareness of the importance of ECD and what parents can do at home in the same areas targeted by Tayssir to further enhance impact. Despite the promising approaches described above and the opportunities for Morocco to enhance children's outcomes, a number of challenges are likely to remain. One key challenge is that of coordination since ECD involves actions from multiple sectors. The 2011 evaluation of the National Action Plan for Children (PANE) found that challenges with intersectoral coordination among responsible parties achieved limited results (Government of Morocco, 2011). It is ideal to have a mechanism in place to coordinate across these different sectors and ensure that children receive the necessary services from each of them, often simultaneously, during the early childhood years. For example, Jamaica created an Early Childhood Commission to develop standards and licensing regulations for early childhood institutions, advise the Ministry of Education on policy matters relating to early childhood, assist in the planning of and preparation for strategies and programs, and monitor the implementation of programs. The Commission reaches across sectors and political parties (Naudeau, Kataoka, Valerio, Neuman, & Elder, 2011) .",

For example, the community preschool in Mozambique cost US$30 per child per year (Martinez, Naudeau, & Pereira, 2012) . The private sector can also play a role in financing to diminish the burden on public funding sources.

This work assessed a number of different measures of ECD, but many were available only once or twice within a decade. More up-to-date information, as well as information on additional dimensions of children's early experiences is a crucial part of making ECD a policy priority and monitoring progress. Morocco has made some progress in collecting information about ECD, for instance, adding questions about development activities to the ENPSF, but much more comprehensive and frequent national survey data would help identify progress and challenges. We particularly recommend adding additional measures of ECD to the ONDH panel for future rounds. ECD is a crucial measure of human development and the regular frequency of the ONDH panel would provide valuable updates. Information can also help galvanize policy and programmatic actions. Data on progress and challenges can help identify what programs and policies are or are not working well and spur change.

This paper has examined ECD in Morocco across multiple dimensions of development and over time.

However, the persistent inequalities in economic and human development remain major concerns at the highest levels of government (Morocco World News, 2014) . The fact that the trends in ECD have been mixed over time and that inequalities have also persisted likely contributes to the unequal human capital and economic outcomes Moroccans experience. The deficits and inequalities we observe in ECD are troubling from the perspective of human rights and issues of equity because children are being affected by circumstances entirely outside of their control.
