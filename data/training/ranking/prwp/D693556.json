The World Bank (1995) found that there were, as of June 1994, 565 such contracts in 32 developing countries, where they are principally used for large utilities and other monopolies, and another estimated 103,000 in China, where they are also used for manufacturing SOEs. PCs are written agreements between SOE managers, who promise to achieve specified targets in a given time frame, and government which (usually) promises to award achievement with a bonus or other incentive.

        "text": "The rationale for incentive contracts such as PCs is largely based on principal/agent theory (for reviews see Ross 1991; Stiglitz 1974; Sappington 1991) . The principal (in the case of state enterprises, the government officials) can only observe outcomes and cannot measure accurately the effort expended by the agent (the SOE manager) or distinguish the effects of effort from other factors affecting performance (Laffont and Tirole 1986, 1993) . A negotiated incentive contract is viewed as a device to reveal information and motivate managers to exert effort. In the case of SOEs, performance contracts are also touted as a way to clarify the objectives of the multiple principals who govern state owned firms (different ministries, the president, the legislature), and hence make it easier to set goals and evaluate achievements. Proponents argue that the contract can translate multiple objectives into targets measured by specified criteria and given weights to reflect priorities (see Jones, \"Performance Evaluation for State-Owned Enterprises\" in Ramamurti and Vernon 1991) . Moreover, targets can be set to take into account circumstances where SOE managers have less control over their firms than comparable managers in the private sector. For example, performance might be judged against the firm's past trends, rather than against an industry standard, to take account of situations where the firm's performance is sub-standard because of government imposed constraints (such as prohibitions on layoffs, price controls, etc.) By specifying targets and evaluating results ex post, the PC is seen by its advocates as a way to encourage governments to reduce ex ante controls, giving managers more freedom and motivation to improve operating efficiency.",

Song (1988) and Trevedi (1990) suggest positive outcomes based on country case studies in Korea and India respectively. Trevedi finds that India's memorandum of understanding improves the dialogue between SOE management and government, but does not rigorously analyze the impact of the PCs on firm performance. Song finds improvement in performance in Korea, but the counterfactual is poorly specified. Nellis (1989) finds the effects of PCs in Africa were amnbiguous, in part because at the time of the study the experience was still recent. Shirley and Xu (1997) found that PCs did not improve total factor or labor productivity or profitability because they failed to reduce information asymmetry, provide sufficierntly high-powered incentives and credibly commit both parties to the goals of the contract. Their sample, however, was small (12 company cases in six developing countries), limited to natural monopolies, and consisted entirely of seriously flawed contracts. A larger, more diverse sample might find that, properly designed, PCs can improve performance, and shed light on how contracts should be designed in order to improve efficiency.",

However, since we are interested in contracts between government and state enterprises, the differences between China and other countries are less important than they would be if we were drawing conclusions for private firms. Studies of SOEs (such as World Bank 1995) suggest that the situation of SOEs in developing market economies closely resembles that of state enterprises in China (although not township and village enterprises) and other transitional economies. In both cases, governments intervene widely in operations, extend protection from competition and bankruptcy, and provide subsidies and debt relief. Since our study of PCs in China extends an earlier analysis of PCs in six market economies (Ghana, India, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, and Senegal), radically different findings could suggest that China's special circumstances might be the cause. This was not the case, however. Finally, we postulate that the productivity effects of PCs are a function of how well the contracts address problems of information asymmetry, incentives, and commitment, contractual features which, judging from the literature on information economics, are the most important generic elements in characterizing contracts and country circumstances. At the same time we have attempted to control for as many aspects of the unobservable as we can, such as technology differences, competitive environment, etc., which should reduce the influence of factors which might be special to China in our results.",

Byrd (1991) describes in useful detail the principal types of performance contracts, and suggests that the main advantage of PCs over the traditional mode of government oversight was that they enhance and legitimize the positions of factory managers. He argues that the main problems with PCs are the strong bargaining power of managers, the tendency for local governments to opt for types of PCs that were easily implemented (rather than the most efficient or most suitable for local conditions), not enough risk-bearing on the part of firms, ambiguous ownership type, and non-credibility of contracts. Byrd (1991) , however, does not offer systematic evidence about the effectiveness of PCs. is more closely related to this paper. It examines the contractual provisions that affect SOE managers (such as length of the contract, management turnover, and the changing management pay sensitivity) and find that these provisions are consistent with a well-functioning managerial labor market. Groves et al. also analyzes the determinants of many other provisions, but does not systematically assess how they affected productivity, with the exception of the impact of management turnover. In contrast, our focus is on the impact of alternative specifications of performance contracts and their quantitative importance.",

Seventy one percent of the contracts specified an ex ante wage elasticity--the percentage by which total wages would increase when profits increased by 1 percent -which varied from 0.1 for the 5th percentile to 0.8 for the 95th percentile, with a median of 0.6.

In our empirical analysis, the reduction of information asymmetry is represented by bidding and targets which focused on profits. First, we expect that bidding, by providing government with more information about the firms and potential managers (as well as by adjusting the manager's incentive to the conditions of the firm, as shown by Nalebuff and Stiglitz 1983 and McAfee and McMillan 1987) , will reduce shirking and hence should be associated with better performance. Second, we expect that profit targets, by providing a more comprehensive signal about a firm's perfornance than tax or output targets, will also be associated with better performance. When the primary target is output, the firm may over-produce lowquality or high-cost products without increasing profits or efficiency; when it is tax, the firm may sacrifice investment or other expenditures important to long-term growth to be able to pay the tax (leaving aside the broader issue of whether the allocation of income to taxes instead of retained earnings enhances welfare). Profitability targets, in contrast, measure whether firms maximize revenues and minimize costs; as long as the firm does not enjoy monopoly power (in which case it can meet the target by raising prices), higher profitability should be associated with higher effort. Because the majority of our firms were competitive, we expect that PCs with targets which focus on profitability are more likely to improve performance than those focused on tax or output goals. 8 Finally, we expect that PCs signed with firms facing more competition benefit from less information asymmetry and hence should be associated with higher productivity. Performance measures will be more meaningful, and shirking will be more evident in competitive firms relative to firms with more market power, and it will be easier to discern the firms' true efficiency level by comparing them with other similar firms. In the empirical analysis we proxied for competition with markup ratios (based on Li 1997; see appendix).",

Since incentives to SO]Es have a cost to society, governments will try to assure that the incentive payment does not exceed the social gain from increased firm efficiency. Hence, when there is information asymmetry, government will tend to set the incentive too low to motivate much improvement in performance. Alternatively, government may opt for a high powered incentive despite information asymmetry, in which case the firm may use its private information to extract a bonus without improving efficiency (for example, by convincing the government that the firm is less efficient than it really is, so that targets are set too low). Thus, without solving the information problem, introducing incentives can bring about only limited change. (Laffont and Tirole, chapter 1, 1994) . In our analysis, the inceintive we investigate is the elasticity of the total wage bill to profits. This incentive device has drawbacks. First, it may be distributed equally among employees in a context where there are limited ways to punish shirking (for example, there are often restrictions on firing SOE workers), which may reduce its incentive effects. Second, it reduces funds available for investment, which may reduce the long-term growth rate.",

To entangle the causal effects from those of firm or sample heterogeneity, we allow PC-participants to have different productivity levels and growth rates throughout the sample period; similarly, we experimented with allowing firms with PC featurej to have different productivity levels and growth rates relative to those without PC featurej.

Our estimations can be based either on the pooled sample of both PC-participants and nonparticipants, or on the sample of participants only. The PC effects in the pooled sample suffer from two sources of bias: (a) a cross section selection bias, that is, when the selection of better firms to sign PCs results in higher productivity which is wrongly attributed to the effects of the PCs; and, (b) a time series selection bias, that is, when the change in the unobservable of the participants leads to gains which are wrongly attributed to the PCs. The advantage of using the pooled sample is the increase in sample size; the disadvantage is the upward cross-section bias that results because good firms may select into PCs. On the other hand, the smaller sample of PC participants suffers only from the time-series selection bias, i.e., that PC participants may tend to show accelerated growth over time whether they sign a contract or not. This suggests that the estimates based on the sample of P4C participants may be more accurate than the pooled sample.

In the third simulation, bare bones PCs with profit orientated targets are found to be somewhat better than bare bones PCs with other targets, since the negative effects on productivity levels becomes insignificant and smaller. However, firms with this type of PC still would not perform any better than firms without PCs. In the fourth simulation firms with a bare bones PC where the manager posts a bond are found to be indistinguishable from firms without PCs in terms of growth rates (the correlation is negative but insignificant), yet they are associated with a significant and negative productivity level (of 12 percentage points). Roughly 9 percent of our sample had PCs similar to this one. The fifth line presents bare bones PCs coupled with a mean level of wage elasticity, 0.42, and the sixth, with wage elasticity one standard deviation above the mean, 0.75. Both types of PCs have no statistically significant association with productivity, suggesting that firms with PCs such as these are indistinguishable from firms without PCs. Seventh, a firm with a bare bones PC and a markup ratio one standard deviation below the mean, is found to be indistinguishable from a firm without a PC. Finally, combining all the \"good\" features with a wage elasticity at the mean, results in a PC with a negative, but statistically insignificant, association with productivity levels effects (13 percentage points). When the wage elasticity is one standard deviation above the mean, the effect on levels is still negative and insignificant, but smaller (2 percentage points). In both cases the growth rate effect is significant, positive and about 10 percent. This suggests that, in the long run, firms with this type of PCs would outperform firms without PCs.

Given the wasted effort and possible penalty of poorly designed PCs, one wonders why good provisions were not more widely used in China. Byrd (1991) suggests some possible explanations. When the central government decided to implement PCs on a national scale, it left a great deal of discretion to the local governments. These governments had limited skills and resources to implement complex contracts, and consequently he found a tendency to adopt the \"lowest common denominator\" (Byrd, 1991) , or what we call bare bones PCs. Another explanation suggested by his work is that the design of the PCs was constrained by macroeconomic conditions. Throughout this period Chinese SOEs faced large macroeconomic fluctuations (as evidenced by frequent and cyclical credit tightening and loosening over time), which increased information asymmetry (since it was harder to distinguish between the effects of management's efforts and the effects of economic fluctuations). We would expect that when information asymmetries are large, government would prefer contracts with low powered incentives and shorter duration. World Bank (1995) suggests an additional, political factor. Governments may not want managers under PCs to introduce reforms that injure any of their main political support bases, such as workers, and hence may prefer sub-optimal PCs in firms with large numbers of employees. Shirley and Xu (1997) suggest that managerial bargaining power might also affect PC design, leading to softer targets.",

In fact, the central government once hailed the contract system as the official mode for SOE reforms on a national scale. Yet we still observed that the overwhelming majority of the PCs have little or negative growth rate effects, and that the observed frequency for contracts with \"good\" provisions was exceedingly low.

The size of the SOEs shows large variations: while the median firm had 930 employees, the 10th percentile firm had 304, and the 90th percentile had 3175.The data set has two parts. Part one is a quantitative table filled by the accountants of an enterprise. It includes 321 variables covering details about products, costs, wages and labor utilization, investment, financing, fixed assets, profit distribution, taxes, prices, and material inputs. Part two is a questionnaire answered by the manager of the enterprise. The manager answers questions about performance contracts signed with the",

Based on these answers we computed average inflation rates for equipment. For 1980 For -1984 yearly inflation rates are assumed. For 1989, since we do not observe equipment inflation, we used the output inflation rate in the machine industry in 1989 as a proxy.Since the survey does not provide information on prices of buildings or plant, for the inflation of building prices we used the percentage increase in aggregate construction costs compiled by the State Statistical Bureau. This series has also been used by Li (1997) .The composite price index for capital goods are then computed by averaging the equipment price index and the buildings and plant price index, the weights being the investment expenditures on equipment and plant.We based our measure of capital stock on capital assets \"for productive use\", which includes plant and equipment for industrial production. (In contrast, capital assets \"for non-productive use\" are mainly buildings and expenditures on dormitories, cafeterias, employee housing, and other social welfare functions.) For our purpose of measuring the contribution of capital, the use of \"productive\" capital assets is more appropriate. Following Li(1997) and Gordon and Li (1994) , we choose not to use the net value of capital stock as the base to compute capital stock because the former \"tend to exaggerate the increase in enterprise capita stock during the sample period in which the inflation rate was high, because the accounting rate of depreciation was artificially low and the depreciation was based on historical costs\" (Gordon and Li, 1994) .Realized investment at year t is imputed by subtracting the nominal value of productive capital assets at the end of year t-l from that at the end of year t. The reported investment, usually different from our imputed figures, is not used because it measures the value of capital expenditure (rather than capital formation) in a given year. It includes, e.g., expenditure on ongoing construction projects; while it excludes prior investment projects completed in the year.When assuming that investment occurs smoothly over the course of a year, we can compute the capital stock in 1980( K, 80 ), the initial year, as ",
