        "text": "An important source of inefficiency in the financial system in many developing and transition economies relates to the high costs associated with the enforcement of loan contracts, which are due in part to the weaknesses of the legal infrastructure (the inability of lenders to seize collateral in case of default, for instance) and a high degree of asymmetry in information between lenders and borrowers. The present paper examines the implications of this type of inefficiency for debt relief in an economy in which there exists a direct link between bank credit and the supply side, through firms' working capital needs. Section II describes the analytical framework, which combines the costly state verification approach pioneered by Townsend (1979) and the model of limited enforceability of contracts used in the external debt literature, as in Eaton et al. (1986) and Helpman (1989a) . 2 In addition to the new debt contracted to finance labor costs during the production period, firms also hold a large initial stock of debt that they must repay out of current revenue. Section InI derives a debt Laffer curve and determines the optimal level of debt. Section IV analyzes the effect of a reduction in the efficiency of the financial intermediation process (characterized by an increase in contract ISee, for instance, thediscussion of the causes and propagation of the Asian crisis in Alba et al. (1999) and Radelet and Sachs (1998) .",

It is shown that all of these shocks may shift the economy to the wrong side of the debt Laffer curve. Section V draws some of the policy implications of the analysis. In particular, although reducing the face value of debt could make both lenders and borrowers better off-as emphasized by Krugman (1988) and Sachs (1989) in their analysis of the debt overhang in a more general context-a higher degree of financial sector inefficiency may prevent any welfare gain.",

Output is subject to random, idiosynncratic productivity shocks. Following Townsend (1979) , the realized productivity shock is revealed to banks ex post only at a cost. In the event of default by any given producer on its bank loans, the creditor seizes a fraction of the realized value of output. Seizing involves two types of costs: first, the cost involved in verifying the actual value of output, as mentioned earlier; second, the cost of enforcing repayment, because enforcement of the terms of loan contracts requires costly recourse to the legal system.",

        "text": "We assume that the representative domestic producer starts the period with an initial level of debt, denoted D. This initial debt could be interpreted in various ways. The interpretation that comes the closest to what we have in mind is an economy that has borrowed significantly on world capital markets during a number of periods prior to the current one and suddenly finds itself \"cut off\" (or rationed out) from these markets-as a result for instance of contagion effects, that is, a crisis elsewhere that leads foreign lenders to suddenly ration credit to a class of borrowers assumed to share similar risk characteristics or weaknesses in \"fundamentals.\" This interpretation is, of course, also quite relevant for countries that are themselves undergoing a financial crisis; the country risk premium that such countries face on world financial markets may climb to prohibitive levels as a result of the uncertainties created by the crisis (such as an increase in the perceived risk of default of domestic borrowers due to a sharp slowdown in economic activity), effectively rationing them out of the market. In either case, we assume that the initial level of debt must be serviced in the current period, and that the inability to borrow on world capital markets does not lead to an outright default; rather, domestic producers borrow from domestic banks to finance their working capital needs and, depending on the state of nature, choose or not to repay the initial debt and the new borrowing from local intermediaries. We assume that the interest rate on the initial debt is predetermined at the beginning of the current period, and for simplicity set it to zero. We also assumed that the debt matures at the end of the current period, an assumption that can easily be relaxed. Thus, D represents also total repayment obligations on the initial debt.",

Note also that a larger level of initial debt increases E, thereby reducing the first term on the right-hand side of equation 17; this term approaches zero for a large enough level of initial debt. Similarly, higher initial levels of debt raise the absolute value of the second, negative term in the above expression, because dnh/dD < 0: a higher level of initial debt lowers employment and thus output, making default more probable and lowering the value of claims that creditors can seize in case of default. Hence, for a large enough level of initial debt, the right-hand side of (17) is negative. The \"optimal\" level of initial debt, denoted by D*, corresponds to the value of the stock of debt for which dV/dD = 0 and is obtained at point A. Beyond point B, the probability of repayment falls below unity; and beyond point A, levels of debt are so high that additional amounts of debt actually lower expected repayments. Consequently, the association between the contractual value of the initial debt and its expected value has the typical inverted U (or concave) shape that characterizes the debt Laffer curve (see Krugman (1988 Krugman ( , 1989 and Sachs (1989) ). The difference between the (present) value of the country's contractual debt obligations and the expected resource transfers that must be made to service that debt, V, measures the debt overhang.",

        "text": "Despite the stylized nature of our analysis, the foregoing results are useful to understand some aspects of the crisis in East Asia and the policy responses that it could have led to. To many observers, one of the surprises that surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the crisis was that the outstanding stock of private external debt, particularly in Korea and Thailand, was much larger than previously assumed (see Aizenman and Marion (1999) ). This is consistent with the assumption in our model of an \"initial\" level of debt that must be serviced out of current resources. Furthermore, simple calculations show that there was a significant increase in output volatility in the aftermath of the crisis. The coefficient of variation of the industrial production index increased between the period January 1991-June 1997 and July 1997-December 1998 (that is, in the immediate aftermath of the crisis) from 3.6 percent to 6.8 percent in Korea, from 4.3 percent to 5.2 percent in Malaysia, and from 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent in Thailand. This is captured in our framework by examining the impact of higher volatility on the shape of the debt Laffer curve. Finally, the crisis revealed also the state of the private banking system, and the relatively high cost of bankruptcy procedures. Although we do not have firm evidence that verification and enforcement costs of loan contracts increased in the region in the aftermath of the crisis, it is plausible indeed that such costs rose significantly. Asymmetric information problems tend to be exacerbated in a more volatile economic environment, thereby forcing banks to expend more resources to assess and verify claims made by borrowers regarding their situation. All these developments may have led some of the crisis-stricken countries-such as Korea, where domestic firms were highly indebted-to move on the wrong side of their debt Laffer curve. As shown earlier, lower productivity, higher volatility of output, and higher financial intermediation and enforcement costs shift the debt Laffer curve leftward and inward, whereas a larger outstanding stock of debt shifts the economy's position to the right-possibly to an extent that is large enough to create a debt overhang problem.",

In practice, however, there are also well-known difficulties associated with a coordinated debt reduction among a (large) group of creditors, such moral hazard problems that such operations entail: each creditor has an incentive to refrain from offering debt relief on its own claims and wait for others to do so, thereby raising the expected value of its own claims.\" 5 This type of free-rider prob 14In particular, a high level of debt creates uncertainty about the country's capacity to service its debt and discourages private (domestic and foreign) investment.

The ability of lenders to have recourse to an efficient legal system to seize collateral in case of default, for instance, is an important determinant of contractual relations (in a crisis context or not) and has a significant impact on the determination of lending rates-and thus eventually the levels of output and employment. In terms of our Figure 1 , the reduction in C could lead, for instance to a shift in the Laffer curve from an initial segment BL' to BL. Moreover, as can be inferred from our analysis, it is possible that debt relief may not be sufficient to shift the economy to the \"right\" side of the debt Laffer if at the same time enforcement or verification costs increase. In terms of Figure 1 , this would be the case, for instance, if debt reduction, starting from a level of debt equal or greater than D*, moves the economy from a point to the right of A to a point to the left, such as H; if there is at the same time a rise in C (because of an increase in verification costs, as discussed earlier) the economy may settle to a point such as H' on the new BL' segment and to the left of A', implying that the economy would still be on the \"wrong\" side of the Laffer curve.

After presenting the producer's decision problem, we analyzed the determination of the contractual lending rate on the new debt, which was shown to be a mark-up over the cost of borrowing, with the size of the mark-up related positively to the probability of default. We also showed that optimal employment depends negatively on the cost of state verification and contract enforcement, as well as the initial stock of debt obligations held by firms. We then derived a debt Laffer curve with regard to the initial debt, and determined the \"optimal\" level of debt consistent with the absence of a debt overhang. We analyzed the effect of an increase in contract enforcement and verification costs, as well as an expected negative shock to output and an increase in the volatility of productivity shocks, on the optimal level of debt. We showed that, as a result of either one of these shocks, the economy may move on the \"wrong\" side of the debt Laffer curve. Moreover, our analysis showed that this shift may be accompanied by (possibly large) employment and output losses in the short term. Thus, in countries where financial intermediation is highly inefficient (in the sense that enforcement costs of loan contracts are relatively high), or in a country experiencing large adverse output shocks and higher volatility, the likelihood of an inefficient equilibrium is also high. We also argued that because, of well-known moral hazard problems, debt relief as a policy response to an economy that is moved to the wrong side of the Laffer curve (as a result, for instance, of an increase in volatility or higher state verification costs) may not feasible or desirable. On the contrary, what our analysis suggests, is that financial sector reform (in the sense of measures aimed at reducing the cost of financial intermediation, including contract enforcement costs) may be essential-indeed, not only to reduce the adverse incentive effects of a debt overhang, but more generally to increase economic efficiency..
