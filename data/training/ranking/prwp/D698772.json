        "text": "In Africa, more than other developing regions, trade, aid, debt and investment are inextricably linked. African countries are especially dependent on exports growth as it generates the scare foreign exchange needed to import the goods and services required for growth and development. Rising exports lead to rising imports. And, given their importance in the production structure of most African economies, the level of imports (other factors remaining constant) has a direct bearing on national income. Foreign aiC flows can supplement export-earned foreign exchange and enable recipient countries to enhance their impcrt capacity and achieve a higher rate of per capita income and consumption growth than would otherwise be possible. In a dynamic multi-period setting this would doub!e or triple per capita incomes faster than if only domestic resources were relied upon. New borrowings at concessional terms can also reinforce this effect provided the debt servicing payments on the existing s.ock of debt are lower than the new debt flows. Unfortunately, the severity of the debt problem in more than half of SSA countries has limited this option. Finally, foreign private investment, an increasingly important source of capital flows to developinig countries, has several added advantages for Africa. This paper attempts to bring together these three elements of the external sector ---trad&, aid and investment -and assess their effects on growth and sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first section focuses on trade. It examines trends in export performance and imports and evaluates some of the main hypotheses that are advanced to explain Africa's relatively weak performance in foreign trade. The second section focuses on external aid, and raises a few issues about the sustainability and effectiveness of development assistance. The final section explores determinants of private investmnent in Africa and asks the question: What needs to be done to attract domestic and foreign investment?",

A few countries, suCil as Kenya and Mlauritius, have diversified somewhat out of primary products, but they remain the exception. The markets for SSA exports have also changed little. Roughly half of the region's exports still go to the EC. African exporters have yet to take advantage of the booming markets of Asia. For most of St' Saharan Africa, growth in imports has tended to outpace growth in exports, gener..dng a ma:or foreign exchange constraint and impinging on overall economic growth. This consrraint was particularly acute in the 1980s. This was the result in part, of thu adoption of mniport substitution policy, and in part to inconsistent macroeconomic policy.

One study 27/ attempting to explain the GDP growth of SSA for the period 1970-86, shows that the strongest explanatory variable is the growth of export earnings; even when the import growth variable is introduced,the result is unchanged. i.e. its coefficient remains significant and with positive sign. The other study 28/ for a cross section of sixteen African countries (using period-average data) shows a strong positive relationship between export growth and GDP growth. These results demonstrate the importance of export growth in augmenting the GDP growth in SSA, though it is not obvious wkiether they capture the fact that increased exports increase the capacity to import and this relaxes the ir.1port constraint on growth or whether the growth of exports arises from efficienc.y increases generated by trade liberalization.",

Twenty countries experienced term of trade losses averaging 28%.

With sustained policy reforms, private capital inflows could improve significantly through increased private remittances, reverse capital flight and improved inflows of foreign private investment. Evidence from several countries (such as Ghana and Senegal), however, suggests that restoring private sector confidence takes time and that during the next decade only moderate progress can be expected. Moreover, given deteriorating credit-worthiness, non-concessional borrowing should be lower than in the past. It is estimated that the net receipts from these sources will be moderate, probably about $6 billion a year.",

Debt, on the other hand, requires full repayment of interest and principal on loans. The reinvestment also involves less constraints and has an almost built-in rollover mechanism compared with the fluctuations in commercial bank lending.Fourth, FDI permits a closer match between the maturity structures ot the earnings from an investment and that of the required payments to the capital used to finance it,thus avoiding the mismatch created when developing countries borrow short term to finance long term investments. FDI also offers externalities, which borrowing does not. FDI flows help in easing capital shortages and financing balance of payments but its long-term benefit lies more in the transfer of technology, human capital creation, the development of managerial skills and foreign market penetration.
