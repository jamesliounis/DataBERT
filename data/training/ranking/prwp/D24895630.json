First, we analyze how the elasticity of exports to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), a standard synthetic measure of the price competitiveness of countries, has changed over time and across countries and sectors. Second, we study how the formation of Global Value Chains (GVCs) has affected this relationship. Figure 1 focuses on a sample of Central Eastern European countries and provides some suggestive preliminary evidence to motivate our analysis. The figure shows that those countries that are more tightly integrated in German supply chains (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia) saw a much stronger flattening of the REER growth / export growth to Germany correlation than those that are more loosely integrated in German supply chains (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovenia). While other factors were certainly at play, this evidence suggests that cross-border production linkages may contribute to reducing the effectiveness of depreciations to boost exports.",

The period of analysis and sample size are determined by the availability of value-added trade data from the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database used to assess the role of GVC integration. We focus on manufacturing exports because of the importance of cross-border linkages in this sector. We find evidence that the REER elasticity of exports has decreased over time. Specifically, the REER elasticity of gross real exports fell in absolute value from an average of 1.1 at the beginning of the period to 0.6 at the end of the period.",

Specifically, we examine whether the formation of cross-border supply chains has affected the REER elasticity of exports. To understand the role of GVCs in the transmission of exchange rate changes, we need to decompose gross exports into their domestic and foreign valueadded components, where the latter consists of the imported inputs embodied in exports. Cross-border production linkages are expected to lower the REER elasticity of (gross) exports for two reasons. First, an exchange rate depreciation improves the competitiveness of domestic value added in exports, but raises the cost of imported inputs. Second, as domestic value added embodied in exported intermediates can be further processed and exported to third countries, a depreciation makes downstream producers more competitive.",

        "text": "To capture these ideas in a simple way, we use two measures of GVC integration developed by Koopman et al. (2010) . The first variable measures the participation of a country to cross-border production. Participation can take place through forward linkages (i.e. domestic value added exported in intermediates re-exported to third countries) and/or backward linkages (i.e. foreign value added embodied in gross exports; that is, the import content of exports). We expect higher GVC participation to lower the REER elasticity of exports because, as discussed above, both backward and forward linkages should mute the competitiveness gains of a depreciation. The second measure captures the position of a country in GVCs, whether upstream or downstream (i.e. whether the country enters GVCs predominantly through forward or backward linkages). Since the position variable measures the relative strength of backward and forward linkages, its impact on the REER elasticity of exports is in principle ambiguous.",

For countries with highest participation in supply chains (i.e. in the first 20 th percentile in our dataset), this channel explains more than half of the reduction of the exchange rate elasticity over the period of analysis. Importantly, the finding that GVC participation reduces REER elasticity is quite robust and continues to hold when we use industry-level data which are less likely to suffer from endogeneity problems. We also find some -even if not consistent-evidence suggesting that the role of GVCs in dampening the responsiveness of exports to a real depreciation is mainly due to backward linkages rather than other metrics such as the position of a country in the value chain. Intuitively, a depreciation of the real exchange rate only improves competitiveness of domestic value added embodied in final good exports. The larger an economy's import content of exports, the smaller the impact on export volumes of a depreciation.",

        "text": "As the above results illustrate, the decline of the REER elasticity of exports can be in part explained by the fact that REERs do not properly capture changes in price competitiveness in a world with GVCs. As Johnson (2014) puts it, countries ultimately produce and trade value added. Indeed, we show that, using measures of REER that correct for GVC participation developed in the literature Johnson, 2013, and Bayoumi et al., 2013) , we do not find the same decreasing pattern of elasticity over time. Interestingly, we also find that the estimates of the elasticity of value-added exports to valueadded measures of the REER are about 1/2 to 1/6 of our estimates in gross terms. While more work is needed in this area, this may indicate that the role of exchange rates in promoting export surges and in the macroeconomic adjustment process needs to be carefully re-evaluated in a world where GVCs are increasingly important. This paper contributes to the part of empirical literature on the impact of exchange rates on export growth. This is an important question as the influential literature on the relationship between exchange rates and income growth (Hausmann et al., 2005 , Eichengreen, 2007 , Rodrik, 2008 emphasizes the role of export surges in the development process, the so called export-led growth. Some studies based on cross-country analysis stressed the role of the level of development and the composition of exports in explaining the impact of exchange rates on exports. Freund and Pierola (2012) find that depreciation stimulates manufacturing exports in developing countries, but not in developed countries. The results in Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) indicate that the effect of the real exchange rate is stronger for exports of services than for goods. We add to this literature by showing that the nature of trade, that is the extent to which countries are integrated in global production chains, also matters to explain the relationship between exchange rates and trade.",

Our results confirm in a cross section the recent findings by Amiti et al. (2014) using disaggregated data for Belgian firms that the impact of a depreciation on export volumes is lower for exporters with higher import shares. Our results are also consistent with the recent work by Mattoo et al. (2014) on the effect of China's exchange rate depreciation on exports of other developing countries in third markets. They find that this effect is substantially attenuated for products that rely more on foreign inputs, and hence have a lower content of Chinese domestic value added. Finally, Eichengreen and Tong (2015) find that two episodes of revaluation of the renminbi increased profits of firms exporting final goods to China, but not necessarily of firms that export intermediate goods for processing.",

GVCs complicate this simple mechanism. 12 Consider backward and forward linkages separately. In presence of backward linkages, a depreciation increases the cost of imported intermediate inputs used in final-good production, thus lowering the competitive gain. When a country exports intermediate goods (forward linkages), a depreciation also increases the competitiveness of downstream producers, which stimulates demand for their goods, thus counterbalancing the expenditure-switching mechanism. Therefore, our conjecture is that backward and forward linkages are associated to a lower exchange rate elasticity of exports. We expect higher GVC participation to lower the REER elasticity of exports, while GVC position has in principle an ambiguous sign.

Finally, we consider value-added exports and alternative measures of REER that correct for the presence of GVCs, namely the REER in Goods Value Added or REER in Tasks Value Added (Bayoumi et al., 2013) , and compare the estimates of the elasticity of value-added exports to these measures with our original estimates.

Column (2) of Table 2 shows that countries with higher participation in GVCs present a lower exchange rate elasticity of manufacturing exports both in the first panel for annual data and the second panel with the five-year averages.

Specifically, the first row in Table 4 presents the same results as in Table 1 but for a shorter time series and less countries due to data availability. In the second line of Table 4 , we regress value-added exports on the standard REER. In the last two rows, instead of using the standard REER and gross exports, we regress value-added exports on two measures of the REER corrected for GVC participation taken from Bayoumi et al. (2013) : the REER in Tasks Value Added (a measure that is close to the value-added REER by Bems and Johnson, 2012) and the REER in Goods Value Added. 15 We establish two main results that corroborate the importance of GVC integration as a determinant of the decline in the responsiveness of exports to real exchange rate changes. First, the value-added REER elasticity does not present the same decreasing pattern as the standard REER elasticity does. This result is independent of the specific measure of the value-added REER.",

Second, we can see that the elasticity in each of the two regressions in value-added terms is lower than the corresponding ones in the first row. This seems to indicate that the impact of a currency depreciation on exports is substantially less when measured in value-added terms. 16 There is one caveat to this second result that we need to bear in mind. The REER adjusted for value-added terms use GDP deflator whereas (gross) REER uses CPI deflator. One may argue that one of the reasons for the decline in elasticity is due to the different deflators. However, using the same gross REER, the first and second row of Table 4 show that the elasticity is indeed lower for value-added exports relative to gross exports, suggesting that different deflators are not a key determinant of our finding.

First, the impact of exchange rate depreciations on exports is at the core of the process of international adjustment and rebalancing. Countries that are more integrated in GVCs will see their exports react less to exchange rate depreciations than that predicted by models that do not properly account for the nature of their trade relations, leading to inaccurate policy predictions. Second, currency depreciations are often viewed as instrumental in stimulating exports and enhancing growth through this channel, particularly in developing countries. However, our results indicate that this mechanism may be less effective for countries that have a large import-content of exports, as currency depreciations only impact the domestic value added embodied in gross exports. More subtly, researchers interested in the trade-growth nexus may need to identify the impact that exchange rate changes have on the ability of countries to anchor to GVCs and hence to benefit from cross-border production linkages (e.g. knowledge spillovers), as GVC integration can itself be endogenous to the macroeconomic conditions of a country. 1996-2001 1996-2002 1997-2003 1998-2004 1999-2005 2000-2006 2001-2007 2002-2008 2003-2009 2004-2010 2005-2011 2006-2012 Elasticity (two SE bandwidth)",

(2014) develop a theoretical framework to compute REERs at the country-sector level. Assessing the impact on (value-added and gross) exports of these new REER measures at the country and sector levels would be a further refinement to the present analysis.16 It could be argued that the value-added component of exports should be more responsive to REER changes but it may also be possible that complementarities between foreign and domestic value added explain the slightly lower responsiveness of domestic value-added exports to the REER. Similarly to the exercise in this section, the independent work in IMF (2015) investigates the impact of value-added REER on value-added exports differentiating between sectors more integrated in GVCs, defined as GVC sectors, and sectors where GVCs are less relevant. Consistently with our results, they find that the competitive impact of a depreciation is stronger for the latter as they rely less on imported inputs.",
