This breakdown has created opportunities for countries to kick start the industrialization of their economies by initially specializing in lower value-added tasks in which they have comparative advantage along a given GVC while at the same time actively investing in activities that culminate in developing comparative advantage in higher value-added tasks at later stages.",

The model is believed to have enabled Chinese firms to specialize initially in low value-added segments of GVCs such as assembly ICT manufacturing, where they bundled low-skill labor services with globally recognized brands and advanced technology to sell them to global consumers. This placed Chinese firms at the center of a triangular trade within which they imported parts and components from Japan; Taiwan, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and other East Asian economies, assembled them into finished products and exported them to the United States and European markets.",

The policy challenges of promoting industrial job growth are thus being framed as one of devising instruments for facilitating entry of domestic firms into manufacturing global value chains (GVCs) at links deemed to maximize the expected gains in jobs and productivity. Yet, the nature of the instruments and the chances of their success are likely to depend on the structure and recent dynamics of existing linkages of the region's economies to manufacturing GVCs. This paper aims to provide an account of both elements, along with an assessment of the role that cross-country differences in natural resource endowment and economic geography seem to have in explaining why they vary as much as they do within the region.",

They also differ a great deal between countries in the region and have changed substantially over the past decade at rates that also vary across countries. A key factor in cross-country differences in the linkage rates and how these have changed in recent years is natural resource endowment. It turns out that, as a group, countries that are rich in non-oil natural resources have greater linkages to manufacturing GVCs than those that are classified otherwise. Linkages to manufacturing GVCs have also grown stronger in nonoil resource rich countries but have declined quite steeply for non-resource rich countries of the region as a group.",

        "text": "The level and dynamics of linkages to manufacturing GVCs also vary between countries within the resource rich group as they do between the non-resource rich, not only because levels of natural resource endowment differ across countries, but also because the linkages depend also on other factors such as differences in the per capita incomes, size and structure of the broader economy and its location relative to other national and regional economies or trade groupings. These other differences seem to explain, for example, why manufacturers in Rwanda as a non-resource rich country have stronger linkages to GVCs than their counterparts in other countries in the same category, such as Senegal. Similarly, differences in additional factors are likely be part of the reason why linkages of local manufacturers in Ghana are not as strong as those of their counterparts in other resource rich economies such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, and Zambia. These additional factors include countries' physical, cultural, political proximity to larger economies, as well as their trade policies and membership in regional trading blocs. An estimated gravity model of sources of the import content of manufactured exports and destinations of the indirect component of those exports highlights and quantifies the role of these factors. Furthermore, using firm-level data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys, the paper shows that the domestic actors in these linkages are typically relatively large establishments of 100 or more employees that have been in operation in for five years or longer. These manufacturers are also more likely to have foreign equity holders or foreign technology licenses.",

(2016) make use of the EORA database to estimate upstream linkages in GVC participation for countries in the region as the outcome of a range of control variables that are also of interest to this study. The report by AfDB, OECD, UNDP (2014), looks specifically at the role of GVC participation in the context of a strategy for the industrialization of an economy. It is also based on estimates of upstream linkages (the share of FVA in country exports) as well as downstream linkages (the share of DVX in county exports) for a wider range of two-digit or three-digit ISIC industries than those reported in Allard et al (2016) . 3 Allard et al (2016) conclude that many countries in the region have comparative advantage in tasks that might have high shares in the value added of final goods in manufacturing industries. This is consistent with the even stronger conclusion of AfDB, OECD, and UNDP (2014), also based on the EORA database, that in Africa as a whole -including North Africa -local manufacturers are more integrated into GVCs than domestic firms in agriculture, mining or services.",

The model to be estimated can be extended by adding equations that can capture empirical regularities that are not necessarily included in Antras and de Gortari (2016) and yet are consistent with it.

Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2014) show that the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem holds appropriately modified to a world of trade in final goods and the tasks involved in their production are also offshored by firms across international borders. The modification to the statement of the H-O theorem is that a country would still specialize in producing and exporting final goods that are intensive in its most abundant factor, but the country's \"endowment\" in a factor now would include the amount of it that would \"shadow migrate\" to the country in question through the offshoring of some tasks by the firms of that country. They also show that the Stolper-Samuelson theorem and the Rybczynski theorem apply to trade including the offshoring of tasks, with some modification. The first of these needs to be modified to define exogenous price changes to be inclusive of the cost savings that offshoring entails, while the exogenous changes in factor endowment that the second relates to must include the \"shadow migration\" of factors that offshoring entails.

A major factor in cross-country variation in linkage rates within the region is natural resource endowment, with countries that are rich in non-oil natural resources having greater linkages to manufacturing GVCs. Linkages to manufacturing GVCs have also increased over the period in non-oil resource rich countries but have declined quite steeply for non-resource rich countries as a group. This development needs to be seen against the premise that governments' efforts across Africa for promoting job growth through industrialization would succeed only in as far as they facilitate entry of domestic firms into manufacturing GVCs at links deemed to maximize expected gains in jobs and productivity.",

This is partly due to differences in the levels of natural resource endowment across countries. It is also because linkage rates depend on other factors such as differences in the per capita incomes, size and structure of the broader economy and its location in relation to other national and regional economies or trade groupings. These other differences seem to explain, for example, why some non-resource rich countries have stronger linkages to GVCs than others. Additional factors include countries' physical, cultural, political proximity to larger economies, their trade policies, and membership in regional trading blocs.

Thus, Indonesia and Vietnam are assessed to be significant players in the manufacturing GVCs in transport equipment among the external comparators as are Malawi and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire among non-resource rich countries of the region, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Zambia among the non-oil resource rich group.

The paper shows that Africa accounts only for a tiny fraction of the volume of trade in manufactures of any one of China, Western Europe, or the United States, with linkage rates to Africa along manufacturing GVCs consequently being extremely low. Yet Africa's manufacturing GVC linkage rate with the three larger economies is comparable to the corresponding linkage rates to economies of other developing regions including the external comparators namely, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.",
