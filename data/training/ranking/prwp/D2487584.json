Accompanying this growth will be an increase in demand for infrastructure services, for both consumption and production purposes. A failure to respond to this demand will cause bottlenecks to growth and hamper poverty alleviation efforts. This paper sets out to estimate the change in demand for infrastructure services that will spring from the expected structural change and growth in income the world is expected to undergo in the next 7 years. We use the same macro model that links growth and demand for infrastructure services that was developed in Fay (2000.) To our knowledge, this paper is the only one that systematically tries to estimate infrastructure need across a cross section of countries and across a variety of sectors.' We then discuss the implication for investment needs across region and income groups. The word \"need\" is used here only to refer to the investment necessary to satisfy consumer and producer demand based on predicted GDP growth. It does not refer to any socially optimal measure of need for infrastructure service or infrastructure investment.",

For lack of comparable data across countries, we excluded ports, airports, and canals -which represent a small share of overall infrastructure endowments -and oil and gas. Table 1 offers a quick review of access to infrastructure services across low, middle and high income groups, showing how infrastructure stocks or access increases along with income. This however, varies somewhat across different types of infrastructure. For water and sanitation, where access, by definition, is bounded at 100, access to water in high income countries is only 1.3 times what it is in poor countries, and 2.2 times higher for sanitation. In contrast, the ratio for mobile phones, a relatively new technology is 91:1 in favor of rich countries. Note finally, that for most types of infrastructure, the difference in access between poor and rich countries is much less than the difference in income (estimated here at about 63: 1.)2 ' Many countries, in the course of their investment plans, make this kind of estimates. These may be much more accurate inasmuch as they are based on individual country and sector data, although in many cases they are more \"wishlists.\" Also, there are sector studies that typically tackle one type of infrastructure such as one on energy by Moore and Smith (1990.) 2 Note that we are not taking into account differences in quality. Thus access to water in high income countries usually means reliable, continuous service, while in many developing countries it may only entail sporadic access to water of unreliable quality.",

Everywhere, roads and electricity represent the bulk of investment accounting for 75 to 85 of total infrastructure value. Water and sanitation drop in relative importance as income increases, while the reverse is true for telecom. *The composition of infrastructure has also changed quite dramatically over time. Whereas in the 1960s, rail accounted for almost a third of the value of infrastructure stocks, today this share has dropped to a mere 6%.

In urban areas this may be a public fountain or standpipe located no more than 200 m from the dwelling.

Sanitation is defined as percentage of population with at least adequate excreta disposal facilities that can effectively prevent human, animal and insect contact with excreta. Suitable facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to flush toilets with sewerage connection.
