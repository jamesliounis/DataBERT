        "text": "This paper examines how financial development influences foreign direct investment. The direct and indirect sectorspecific effects that source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development can have on foreign direct investment are first identified in a conceptual framework. The presence and relative strength of these various channels of influence at the different margins of foreign direct investment are then empirically investigated using unique and underexploited sector-specific bilateral panel data on greenfield foreign direct investment over the period [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] . Causality is established by applying a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the variation in financial vulnerability across manufacturing sectors. The overall effects of higher source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development on the relative volume of bilateral foreign direct investment in financially vulnerable sectors are large, positive, and complementary. These effects appear to operate mainly at the intensive margin rather than at the extensive margin of foreign direct investment. There is also evidence of direct and indirect effects of financial development. The key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral Mergers\\&Acquisitions transactions. Overall, the empirical results unambiguously indicate that a sophisticated and well-functioning financial system in source and destination countries greatly facilitates the international expansion of firms through foreign direct investment, especially in financially vulnerable sectors.",

        "text": "These unfulfilled opportunities can reside in foreign markets. The large upfront fixed costs associated with exporting can be an insurmountable obstacle for financially vulnerable firms when the external finance premium is large. 2 Indeed, a large body of empirical research shows that the volume of exports of firms belonging to financially vulnerable sectors is highly sensitive to the level of source countries' financial development (SFD). 3 Foreign direct investment (FDI) requires even larger upfront fixed costs because a new foreign affiliate must be established or acquired. 4 Hence, on the source side, higher financial development can also be expected to foster FDI, with a disproportionate positive impact on FDI in financially vulnerable sectors. On the destination side, the influence of higher financial development on FDI is ambiguous on theoretical grounds. While a positive access to external finance effect is still likely to exist, several channels have been identified through which higher destination countries' financial development (DFD) could reduce FDI (Antras et al., 2009; Ju and Wei, 2010; Bilir et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, the limited and non sector-specific empirical evidence available points towards an overall positive impact of both higher SFD and DFD on FDI (Klein et al., 2002; Desai et al., 2006; Antras et al., 2009) . 5",

On the source side, the overall expected effect of financial development on FDI is unambiguously positive. Higher SFD can increase FDI directly by improving firms' ability to cover the fixed costs of FDI with outside capital (FDI-specific access to external finance effect) and, indirectly, by fostering domestic activity (general, non-FDI-specific, access to external finance effect). On the destination side, the overall effect of financial development on FDI is indeterminate. Directly, greater DFD makes more outside capital available to foreign investors (FDI-specific access to external finance effect) but also creates an incentive for multinational enterprises to substitute foreign outsourcing for integration (FDI-specific disintegration effect). Indirectly, better access to external finance facilitates local development. This raises the likelihood of more intense local competition (general competition effect) but also of the presence of positive agglomeration externalities (general agglomeration effect). Higher DFD may thus deter or attract FDI, depending on the aggregate influence of these four channels. 7",

In some regressions, we also control for the volume of sector-specific activity in source and destination countries to distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of SFD and DFD on FDI.

The fundamental reason for this is that both exports and FDI involve large upfront fixed costs that firms operating in financially vulnerable sectors will typically be unable to fully cover by relying on internal finance only. 14 The fact that Manova (2013) finds that higher financial development has a positive impact on bilateral exports by promoting the selection of firms into production, the selection of producers into exporting, and higher average firm-level exports suggests that the same effects are also likely to hold for outward FDI flows. 15",

That is because higher financial development generates four different potential effects which do not necessarily go in the same direction: a positive access to external finance effect, a negative disintegration effect, a negative competition effect, and a positive agglomeration effect. The magnitude of these effects can be expected to increase with a sector's financial vulnerability. Firms in financially vulnerable sectors rely more on external finance than firms in other sectors and the substitution of outsourcing for FDI is also likely to be more pronounced in these sectors, in which external investors provide a larger share of total funding and may incur larger losses due to the absence of significant collateral.",

What we mean is that, given the FDI data that we have, we would not obtain different results by sector (implication of this assumption for our results is explored in Appendix C). At the most disaggregated level, the underlying data that we use to estimate models (1) and (2) correspond to 7604 greenfield FDI projects in a new production or processing facility made by 3919 parent companies located in 83 source (developed and developing) countries, in 13 broad manufacturing sectors of 125 (developed and developing) destination countries during the period 2003-2006. 38 A potential drawback of the fDi Markets database is that it only covers investment in a new physical operation. That means that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) FDI flows are excluded from the database. While we do not expect our results to be different across establishment modes of foreign affiliates, we nevertheless wish to validate this hypothesis empirically in robustness checks. We do so in Appendix C, using data on the number of bilateral M&A transactions. Figure 1 plots the cumulated values of outward and inward greenfield FDI over the period [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] against FDI inflows compiled by UNCTAD on the basis of BOP statistics. The latter include information on both greenfield and M&A FDI. There is a strong correlation between the values of these two sources of FDI statistics. This suggests that the greenfield FDI data that we use in this paper are not affected by gross inconsistencies and are potentially representative of trends in both greenfield and M&A FDI.",

By focusing on FDI in a new production or processing manufacturing facility (the 'manufacturing function' in the fDi Markets database), we strongly increase the likelihood that the parent firm truly belongs to the manufacturing industry. Nevertheless, our main results hold when we use an enlarged sample including FDI in all functions by parent firms which invest at least once in the manufacturing function during the period 2003-2010.

They calculated a sector's need for external finance as the fraction of capital expenditures that were not financed with cash flows from operations for a sample of publicly traded US firms in the 1980s. For each firm, the ratio was averaged over the 1980s and the final ED measure corresponds to the sector median. The key assumption underlying the validity of their ED proxy is that the ranking it generates across sectors is stable across countries because a sector's need for external finance is intrinsically linked to sector-specific, but country-invariant, technological characteristics. By using U.S. data on publicly traded firms, Rajan and Zingales (1998) increase the likelihood that they correctly identify a sector's technological demand for external financing. Large firms typically face fewer financing obstacles than small firms and if there is any country in which firms' actual use of external finance reflects their desired level, the United States is perhaps the closest one can find given the sophistication of its financial system. Firms which rely on external finance to conduct their day-to-day trading operations or invest in new growth opportunities at home can be expected to be those which need external financing to expand abroad. The establishment of a foreign affiliate requires substantial purchases of new (e.g. land, building, machinery) or existing foreign fixed assets. It is also plausible that any product which entails high R&D, marketing or distribution costs at home will similarly involve large customisation, marketing and distribution fixed costs when produced and sold in foreign markets (Manova, 2013) . The ED measure developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998) is based on a sample of large U.S. companies, which are likely to have activities abroad. This sample composition helps to make it a good proxy for the typical external financing needs of MNEs in a given sector.",

This may have been true if external finance was only sought to cover the costs of building a new manufacturing facility. However, outside capital is also likely to be required to invest in intangible assets complementary to the tangible assets. Engaging in FDI may then be conditional on the ability of firms to finance the intangible assets that they need to operate successfully in foreign markets. This constraint should be particularly strong for firms operating in sectors where intangible assets are at the core of their business. It is also possible that sector-specific asset tangibility matters if the loan financing the FDI project is backed by the tangible assets of the parent company. That may be the case if a domestic bank does not want to deal with the seizure of assets in a foreign jurisdiction. For these reasons, TANG ought to remain a valid measure of financial vulnerability, including in the context of this paper. 43 The coefficient of correlation between the two financial vulnerability measures is 0. values because data for subsequent years are frequently missing, resulting in a drastic reduction in sample size. Despite the absence of time-variation, these values should nevertheless remain good indicators of the differences in sector-specific activity across countries.

Consistent estimation of the conditional mean parameters \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 can be achieved by using a Poisson fixed effects estimator.

However, the Monte-Carlo simulations of Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and Head and Mayer (2013) indicate that all these alternative estimators perform poorly in presence of heteroskedasticity, which is present in our data. The main reason is that log-linearization of multiplicative models induces a correlation between the transformed error term and the explanatory variables. On the other hand, the Poisson QMLE is robust to various patterns of heteroskedasticity. 49 We also use a Poisson fixed effects estimator to model the extensive and intensive margins of FDI. 50 It is important to note that modeling the average size of the cross-border investments conditional on positive FDI does not result in a sample selection issue. Given that we are interested in how financial development influences average project size when FDI occurs, the observations for which FDI is positive form an appropriate subsample of the population of interest (Wooldridge, 2010) . 51",

Second, the Chinese private credit to GDP ratio is suspect for a middle-income country. Its average size over the 2003-2006 period is 114%, which, if taken at face value, would indicate a financial development level on par with that of Germany. This high Chinese private credit to GDP ratio is believed be the outcome of the inclusion of credit to state-owned enterprises (Djankov et al., 2007) . It does not provide therefore an accurate picture of the availability of external finance for the private sector. This can be potentially worrying for the robustness of our results because the coefficient on the DFD-ED interaction variable could be largely driven by a combination of high FDI flows in China and a reported high DFD. Fortunately, this does not appear to be the case. The only impact of excluding China from the sample is a slight increase in the size of the coefficient on the DFD-ED interaction.",

If the instruments are valid, the inclusion of the first-stage residuals controls for the potential endogeneity of the suspect variables, parameters are consistently estimated (as long some assumptions are satisfied), and the statistical significance of the coefficients on the two control function terms provides the basis for a robust (to assumptions) endogeneity test (Wooldridge, 2010) . 62 These doubts are supported by a Sargan-Hansen test of overidentifying restrictions, reported at the bottom of Table 2 , which rejects the null hypothesis that all instruments are uncorrelated with the error term. To carry out this test, we use GMM estimation. Results are very similar to those obtained with the two-step procedure that we adopted in column (5). ratio, by a time-invariant institution-based measure of financial development. An advantage of this measure is that it is much less likely to be influenced by the activities of MNEs than the private credit to GDP ratio. Our main results are robust to this alternative measure of financial development. The coefficients on both interaction terms are large, positive, and statistically significant at the 1% level. If the Philippines improved its level of financial development to that of Finland, i.e. improved the quality of its financial institutions by about 52%, its outward FDI in a typically high ED sector would increase by about 23% more than its outward FDI in a typically low ED sector. Likewise, its inward FDI in a typically high ED sector would increase by about 18% more than its inward FDI in a typically low ED sector. These substantial economic impacts are similar to those we have previously found with our outcome-based measure.",

Young firms are typically more dependent on external finance than older firms. Their capital expenditures in their first years of existence tend to be larger than in subsequent years and they have limited internal funds.

Nevertheless, we still find that SFD and DFD have positive direct effects on the relative number of bilateral greenfield FDI projects in financially vulnerable sectors, by increasing the share of active producers engaging in FDI or the range of financially feasible investment opportunities. This provides evidence that FDI involves high upfront costs and that financial development in source and destination countries allow firms, especially in financially vulnerable sectors, to overcome the financial difficulties that these costs create.",

The results from column (9) qualitatively differ from those in columns (3) and (6). Here, controlling for sector-specific value added has little impact on the size of the coefficients on the interaction terms. The differences between the estimates reported in columns (8) and (9) are small and not statistically significant. On the source side, the positive general access to external finance effect accounts, at most, for 5% of the overall effect of financial development. This is certainly because larger sector-specific activity is more likely to be associated with a higher number of FDI projects than with larger FDI projects. On the destination side, there is some weak evidence that the negative general competition effect dominates any positive general agglomeration effect: the coefficients on the DFD-ED and DFD-TANG interaction terms are slightly larger (in absolute terms) than in column (8) and the coefficient on the value added of the recipient sector is negative and statistically significant at the 10% level. This result, coupled with the empirical findings of Bilir et al. (2013) at the affiliate level, imply that the greenfield FDI in our database is mostly horizontal (see footnote 19).

A comparison of the estimates reported in column (3) and in columns (11) and (12) indicates that greenfield FDI is relatively more sensitive to a rise in SFD than exports. This stronger effect of SFD on FDI than on exporting is in line with the predictions and empirical evidence of Buch et al.

This result strongly contrasts with the positive effect of higher DFD on relative bilateral FDI in financially vulnerable sectors that we have consistently found. The diametrically different responses of FDI and exports to higher DFD suggest that the latter encourages firms to substitute (presumably horizontal) FDI for exports. 76 This is likely because higher DFD allows more firms in a given sector to satisfy the greater need for external finance that engaging in FDI requires relative to exporting. Hence, in a roundabout way, we find again that the external funds raised in host countries complement the external funds raised in the source country rather than being substitutes.

Directly higher financial development improves access to external finance for those firms which require outside capital to expand in foreign markets and produce there at their first-best levels. This is the main positive effect of financial development on FDI. Indirectly, greater financial development also promotes overall economic activity, notably in financially vulnerable sectors. This raises the volume of producers in source countries and generates agglomeration benefits in destination countries. Any negative FDI-specific disintegration effect or general competition effect that financial development may induce on the destination side tends to be dwarfed by these positive effects of financial development. The overall effects of higher SFD and DFD on the relative volume of bilateral greenfield FDI in financially vulnerable sectors are economically substantial and complementary.

These sub-sectors have ED values very close to those of the main sectors to which they belong. However, we do not include the sub-sector 3522 (Drugs). We found in unreported regressions that its extremely high ED value (1.49) makes it an outlier and distorts the estimates presented in Table 5 , despite representing only 6.5% of the overall M&A deals. While the coefficients on the two financial development-ED interaction terms are positive and statistically significant at the 5% level when this sub-sector is included, their coefficients are 45-66% smaller than those in column (1) of Table 8 .

Precise identification of their coefficients is possible because the estimation of these parameters relies on country-sector variation in FDI, which is largely unaccounted for by the country-level fixed effects that we include in equation 1. Indeed, calculations of pseudo-R 2 suggest that more than 50% of the variation in the dependent variable remains to be explained, once the various fixed effects \u03b1s are controlled for. The absence of fixed effects at the country-sector level also means that differences in financial development across countries can be exploited to identify \u03b21 and \u03b22, in addition to the information provided by changes in financial development within countries. Given the short time dimension of our panel, being able to use the variation in financial development between countries is likely to be crucial for a successful identification of the coefficients on the SFD-FV and DFD-FV interaction terms. A corollary is that the proxy for financial development does not have to be time-varying.24 Given our multiplicative model, these difference-in-differences estimators correspond here to \"ratio-in-ratios\" estimators.25 Note that we would expect \u03b21 < 0 if we used asset tangibility as our financial vulnerability measure. We follow other papers(Braun, 2003;Manova et al., 2011;Manova, 2013) by not inverting this measure such that a higher value corresponds to a lower tangibility of assets.",

With the help of the M&A FDI data, we can gain insights on whether these two compromises had a major influence on our results.First, we collapse the M&A data in the same way as we have done for the greenfield FDI data, before re-estimating our baseline model. Column (4) shows that we get very similar results to those in column (1), suggesting that the use of broad sectors is not a major issue. We then collapse again the M&A data by broad (recipient) sectors but without excluding anymore cross-border M&A transactions between acquiring and target firms not belonging to the same sector. We reproduce in that way the assumption that we had to make with the greenfield FDI data. The outcome is displayed in column (5). Mixing source and destination sectors appears to generate an under-estimation of the impact of SFD on the relative number of cross-border horizontal M&A transactions in more financially vulnerable sectors. This implies in turn that the positive effects of SFD on the relative value of bilateral greenfield FDI in financially vulnerable sectors may have been underestimated because some firms investing in ED sectors do not necessarily operate exclusively in these sectors. Nevertheless, on the basis of columns (4) and (5), we can conclude that the compromises we have made when constructing our greenfield FDI database are unlikely to have had major qualitative consequences for our results. 83",

        "text": "First, they    indicate that bilateral FDI in a sector where firms have no need for external finance and are well-endowed with tangible assets is not affected by increase in SFD or DFD. That is what we would expect on the basis of our literature review, suggesting the absence of an omitted variable bias or ignored additional effects of financial development. Second, they show that the absolute effects of SFD and DFD on bilateral FDI in the other sectors are always positive, and as we have previously shown, increase with a sector's financial vulnerability. 70 That means that our previous results, despite their focus on the effects of financial development on relative bilateral FDI in financially vulnerable sectors, can be interpreted as showing that higher SFD and DFD increases the level of FDI, especially in financially vulnerable sectors. This conclusion agrees with our stylised facts.",
