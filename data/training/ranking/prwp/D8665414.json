But the standard practice among policy makers, financial market participants and international financial institutions is to assess the strength of the fiscal accounts solely on the basis of the cash deficit.

After reviewing the international experience with public investment under fiscal adjustment, the paper lays out an analytical framework to illustrate the consequences of using the public deficit as a guide to solvency.

        "text": "Following this practice, fiscal adjustment programs, and their monitoring, typically focus on the time path of the government deficit. Because current and capital expenditure have identical effects on short-term government cash flows, and adjustment programs rarely set expenditure composition targets, the burden of fiscal adjustment tends to fall disproportionately on public investment and other productive expenditures of the public sector. Recent experiences of industrial and emerging countries attest to this conclusion. 1 The use of public sector cash flow as sufficient statistic of fiscal discipline is especially problematic for those countries that face the task of building up their basic infrastructures, as is the case of most developing countries as well as newcomers to the European Union (EU). Such task demands a large investment effort that, under the action of conventional public deficit targets, would have to be financed through major increases in tax collection, entailing potentially large distortions and running counter to the objectives of tax smoothing and intergenerational equity. 2 The alternative is to restrict the accumulation of productive assets to protect public sector cash flows. This, however, entails a cost in terms of future growth, and thereby an adverse impact on the future cash flows of the public sector, owing to the weakened growth of its revenue base. Thus, enhancing the government's current cash flows may not be an effective strategy to strengthen public solvency. This means that the conventional cash deficit is not a good guide to the strength of public finances, and hence other fiscal targets may do better at helping protect solvency without distorting the composition of spending and jeopardizing growth.",

Over the last two decades, most of the countries in the region adopted fiscal adjustment measures that led to significant increases in the primary surplus. In most countries, the adjustment included a drastic contraction of public infrastructure investment. This is illustrated in the top panel of figure 1, which depicts the trajectories of the primary fiscal deficit and public infrastructure investment, 5 both as percent of GDP, for the average of eight Latin American countries. It is apparent from the graph that the decline in the primary deficit, from around 5 percent of GDP in the early1980s to about zero by 2000, was accompanied by a permanent fall in infrastructure investment, from an average of 3.5 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to 1.5 percent by the turn of the century.",

This is remarkable because public infrastructure investment represents a small fraction of GDP, and a relatively small part of overall public expenditure. This is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 1, which shows the average ratio of public infrastructure investment to the sum of public consumption plus public infrastructure investment --a rough proxy for the overall primary expenditure of the public sector, for which information is not available. The graph shows that in the early 1980s infrastructure investment accounted for just under one-fourth of this expenditure aggregate. By the late 1990s, the proportion had declined to 10 percent. In other words, in the process of fiscal adjustment, investment fell much more abruptly than consumption. Indeed, in a majority of countries public consumption rose relative to GDP, while public infrastructure investment fell, implying that the public investment cuts partly financed an expansion of public consumption. 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 So urce: OECD Eco no mic Outlo o k database.",

For example, an analysis of 32 episodes of fiscal adjustment in countries of the EU during the last two decades shows that in 25 of the 32 episodes public investment fell as percentage of GDP, and in 23 episodes investment fell more than other primary expenditure. Along the same lines, the evidence suggests that fulfillment of the Maastricht deficit targets sped up the decline of public investment in the EU countries: of the nine countries that exceeded the deficit target in 1992, eight met it in 1997; in all eight, public investment had fallen relative to GDP; and in seven, it had fallen relative to total primary expenditure as well. Conversely, three of the six countries that met the target in 1992 raised their public investment in the subsequent years (Balassone and Franco 2000) . Figure 2 illustrates the EU experience. Like in figure 1 above, the top panel shows the trajectories of public investment and the primary fiscal deficit, both as ratios to GDP. There is a clear comovement between the two series, with investment falling sharply during the fiscal adjustment of the 1980s as well as during the post-Maastricht period. Unlike in figure 1, public investment is not limited here to infrastructure; instead, it is inclusive of other categories. Nevertheless, the middle panel of figure 2 suggests that the situation was no different for infrastructure investment. The graph plots public investment in transport and communication along with the primary fiscal deficit. Again, we find a clear comovement between public investment and the primary deficit, with a steady contraction in both following the Maastricht agreement of 1992.",

There is an apparent downward trend, which tends to accelerate at times of fiscal adjustment, indicating that public investment falls more than proportionately during fiscal crunches. Indeed, econometric estimations confirm that the public investment-to-total primary expenditure ratio shows a significantly positive association with the primary deficit, even after accounting for a time trend (which is itself negative and significant). 8 To summarize, the recent drive toward fiscal discipline has been associated, more often than not, with a persistent infrastructure investment crunch. 9 This, of course, is not necessarily a cause for concern. The reduction in public investment might reflect efficiency enhancements, improved public procurement, or reduced corruption, allowing the same services to be provided at a lower investment cost. Also, if private and public capital are close substitutes, the public sector retrenchment may have been fully offset by private sector entry, without any adverse impact on service provision. Finally, public investment contraction might be a perfectly sensible strategy in a context in which the stock of public capital already has reached its target level, or following a shift in priorities toward other productive expenditures--such as education or health--not viewed as investment in the national accounts.",

This amounts to requiring that the government sell the capital assets at a price greater than the present value of the future financial returns that would have accrued from holding them. This might occur if the government smartly manages to overbill the private purchaser or, more realistically, if the returns that the purchaser can accrue (and hence the purchase price s/he is willing to pay) exceed those that the government would have obtained if it had retained the asset. 19 Specifically, the primary surplus will decline (relative to GDP) up to time investment projects may generate indirect financial returns to the government, to the extent that they affect aggregate income growth and hence the expansion of tax bases and public income. 21 The impact of public investment, and particularly infrastructure investment, on aggregate growth has attracted considerable attention in recent years. 22 An abundant body of empirical literature, beginning with Aschauer (1989) , has sought to quantify the contribution of public capital to growth; see Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2007) and Romp and de Haan (2005) for recent overviews. These studies typically are based on the estimation of aggregate production functions augmented with infrastructure stocks (for example, Serv\u00e9n 2003, 2007; Canning 1999; Demetriades and Mamuneas 2000; R\u00f6ller and Waverman 2001) , or on empirical growth equations, including measures of public infrastructure or public investment among the explanatory variables (Aschauer 1998; Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n 2004b; Easterly and Rebelo 1993; Esfahani and Ramirez 2003) . While far from unanimous, a majority of studies -especially those using physical asset stocks to measure infrastructure -find significantly positive effects of public capital on aggregate output and its growth rate, although the findings are less robust among those studies that use public investment flows (or their cumulative value) as regressors. 23 One important implication of this literature is that evaluation of alternative fiscal strategies has to take into account their respective growth consequences, not just to gauge the economy's future aggregate performance, but also to assess the full effects of the different fiscal policy paths on public finances themselves. Analytically, a simple illustration can be provided as follows. Assume that the economy's aggregate production technology is of the form",

Early on, the focus was on the flow of productive public services (Barro 1990; Turnovsky and Fisher 1995) , but more recently, it has shifted to the accumulation of public infrastructure and/or human capital assets, whose services are viewed either as pure public goods (Futagami, Morita, and Shibata 1993; Ghosh and Roy 2004; Kalyvitis 2002) or public goods subject to congestion (Ag\u00e9nor 2004; Glomm and Ravikumar 1997; Turnovsky 1997 ). Zagler and Durnecker (2003) survey this literature. In these models, the impact of public investment on long-run growth is typically positive, but may change sign if public investment rises beyond a certain level. Furthermore, the growth-maximizing level of public investment may differ (most commonly, exceed) its welfare-maximizing level (for example, Turnovsky 1997). 23 The likely reason is that investment spending may be a poor proxy for the accumulation of productive assets; see Pritchett (2000) and Keefer and Knack (2006) . set equal to one and ignored in what follows. 24 Hence, ) 1 ( \u03b1 \u03b3 \u2212 captures the growth of output due to exogenous factors affecting the productivity of public capital.

In reality, things are more complicated: not all capital expenditure is productive -in the sense of increasing current and/or future output supply --and not all current expenditure is pure waste. One important example of productive current public expenditure is that of operations and maintenance (O&M). While public investment in new roads or transport facilities usually attracts much more attention than O&M, the latter is essential for public capital to yield productive services. Information on these expenditures is generally hard to obtain, but anecdotal evidence suggests that they tend to be compressed even more sharply than investment at times of fiscal retrenchment. This should be a cause of concern, because inadequate maintenance reduces the productive contribution of capital assets and shortens their useful life. The key role of O&M has been duly recognized in recent analytical literature. For example, Rioja (2003a Rioja ( , 2003b shows that if maintenance expenditures are too low, new investment in infrastructure can be growth-and welfare-reducing-while additional O&M spending has the opposite effect.",

Thus, the steeper the slope of the lending supply schedule--as reflected by a larger \u03b7 --the less favorable (or more adverse) the impact on net worth of a deficit-financed public investment increase. 32 A second caveat concerns the issue of uncertainty, which has been ignored so far. Yet the net worth calculations above involve estimates of future output, tax revenues, and user fees, all of which are intrinsically uncertain. In this framework, a simple way to take uncertainty into account would be to employ risk-adjusted discount rates to bring future cash flows to present value terms. This would amount to adding a risk premium to the real interest rate, with consequences similar to those described in the previous paragraph. 33 The third caveat is the partial equilibrium setting used here, which neglects feedback effects on the productivity of public capital arising from endogenous changes in the supply of other inputs--labor or, most important, private capital--ignored in equation 7. In reality, changes in public investment will likely affect both the marginal productivity and the user cost of private capital and thus its rate of accumulation. If public and private capital are complements (as much of the empirical literature suggests), then increased public capital accumulation raises the marginal product of private capital and hence encourages private investment. In such case, the growth impact of public investment would be understated in the above analysis, as would be its contribution to government net worth. If public and private capital are complements instead, the conclusion would be reversed. On the other hand, if real interest rates are endogenous, a debt-financed public investment expansion may raise the user cost of private capital and crowd out private investment, and then the above results would overstate the growth and solvency contribution of public capital. Proper account of these general equilibrium effects requires a fully specified macroeconomic model, which is beyond the scope of this paper.",

Figure 3 illustrates the effects of net worth and cash-flow targets on the composition of public expenditure. Along the overall balance (solid) line in the graph, total primary expenditure c+i is constant relative to output; hence, for given tax rates and debt, so is the government's overall balance. The slope of the line equals -1. In turn, along the dashed curve, which describes the contour set of equation 8, net worth is constant. The curve must be steeper than the overall balance line if public capital yields some financial return, whether through user fees or taxes. Furthermore, the slope of the curve is not constant. At low levels of investment, the public capital stock remains low and its return high, and hence the curve is very steep-it may even slope upward over an initial region, if the marginal unit of investment yields a financial return in excess of the cost of borrowing. In the graph, this happens in the segment of the curve between point D and the horizontal axis. As public investment rises, so does the public capital stock, its marginal financial return declines toward zero, and the net worth curve eventually becomes parallel to the overall balance line.

Because the net worth line is steeper than the overall balance line, the government spending mix will generally be more biased toward consumption under binding cash-flow constraints than under net worth constraints. Thus, other things equal, governments facing binding cash-flow targets today may devote too few resources to expenditures that yield returns tomorrow. This is a simple consequence of the different trade-off between consumption and investment posed by net worth targets and cash-flow targets. Related to these effects on the composition of expenditure, the use of the conventional public deficit to gauge the soundness of public finances also creates incentives for governments to adopt policy measures that ostensibly aim at \"fiscal adjustment\" but often are little more than accounting gimmicks. In light of the intertemporal budget constraint, such measures are of no consequence for fiscal solvency, and in some cases, they may even weaken public finances. The international experience highlights a wide variety of illusory adjustment measures, ranging from changes in the time profile of public revenues or expenditures without any change in their present value, to reductions in the rate of public debt issuance achieved through matching reductions in the rate of accumulation of public assets--a strategy that by itself has no effect on public sector net worth. 34 In terms of figure 3, a movement from A to E, for example, improves the overall balance but has no effect on solvency.",

        "text": "Paradoxically, some governments have also resorted to creative tricks to shelter investment from the pressure of deficit limits. For example, many countries have made use of extra-budgetary financing of public investment, effectively hiding the latter from public view. Another popular option has been the issuance of contingent liabilities--such as credit or rate-of-return guarantees--to private investors, under partnership agreements between the public and private sectors. These arrangements can, and sometimes do, have efficiency-increasing effects, but they often leave the public sector bearing most or all of the investment risk, in which case they amount to little more than accounting gimmicks. Furthermore, the lack of clear standards for the budgetary accounting of such operations tends to weaken fiscal transparency, and in some countries, has allowed the accumulation of large hidden liabilities that surfaced unexpectedly--and with large fiscal consequences--when the government guarantees have been called on. 35 The preceding discussion illustrates the fact that cuts in the public sector's productive expenditures undertaken in the name of fiscal discipline may represent another form of fictitious adjustment. Their direct effect is to reduce the conventional public deficit and the rate of debt accumulation, but they may do so at the cost of a slowdown in growth and future fiscal revenue, which indirectly results in reduced future primary surpluses and undermines the fiscal adjustment itself. In terms of figure 3, a movement from A to B, for example, improves the overall balance but weakens solvency. 36 How important, in practice, is this indirect effect? From the preceding discussion, there are two key ingredients. The first is the growth impact of public investment, given by the marginal productivity of public capital as well as its acquisition cost. Other things equal, the marginal productivity is likely to be higher when the government has strong project selection capabilities, so that its investment involves top-quality projects, and when the initial endowment of public capital is low. It should also depend on the composition of public investment. Some public investment projects (for example, in areas such as environmental conservation) unquestionably enhance welfare but have little effect on future output, while others (for example, major roads) may have a significant growth impact. Finally, if the purchase of public capital involves significant waste (i.e., p is high), changes in public investment may have only a minimal impact on asset accumulation and growth.",

At zero initial debt, cuts in infrastructure investment translate 100 percent into net worth increases, but the proportion declines to less than 60 percent if debt equals 40 percent of GDP, and to only 15 percent when debt reaches 80 percent of GDP. In the Latin American context of the late 1980s and 1990s, this means that infrastructure cuts in low-debt Colombia were 80 percent effective at enhancing solvency, whereas in high-debt Bolivia, their effectiveness was only around 20 percent. These exercises are subject to a host of caveats, which make them illustrative rather than conclusive, but they do suggest that, in some Latin American countries, fiscal austerity involving major infrastructure spending cuts not only entailed a substantial growth cost, but also may have been largely ineffective at strengthening public finances.",

Targeting the cash deficit is just one among many possible fiscal rules. The obvious alternative is to look for other fiscal targets and rules that enforce solvency but do not do it at the expense of public investment. 39 In general, fiscal rules should meet some basic requirements: they should be transparent and easy to monitor, ensure government solvency, make good economic sense even in the long run, and properly accommodate different initial conditions. 40 In 38 To quantify this dependence, they rely on estimates of the parameters of an aggregate production function augmented with infrastructure, complemented with the estimation of empirical equations linking the accumulation of infrastructure assets to observed investment-to-GDP ratios. 39 See Mintz and Smart (2006) for an overview of alternative rules and their effects on spending decisions. 40 Buiter (2004) . effect, rules pose a tradeoff between simplicity and economic rigor, which different rules solve in different ways. A cash deficit rule meets the requirements of transparency and easy monitoring but, as discussed above, its economics leave much to be desired. And the lack of explicit allowance for initial conditions tends to make cash deficit rules especially burdensome for countries whose public infrastructure development is lagging, as their choices narrow to postponing such development further, entrusting it to the private sector's decisions, or resorting to large tax efforts to finance it -against the dictates of tax smoothing and intergenerational equity. 41 One of the leading alternatives to the conventional cash deficit rule is the golden rule, which prevents the government from running a deficit on current account but allows borrowing to finance (net) investment -i.e., if the borrowing is used to create assets. To put it differently, the golden rule requires that the public sector's income statementwhich excludes public investment but includes the depreciation of public capital --be in surplus. This idea of separating the current and the capital budgets is hardly new, 42 but has been revived in the last few years (H.M. Treasury 2002, Blanchard and Giavazzi 2004) .

The assets could yield low or no return (they could be 'white elephants'). Even if they do yield high returns, the state might be unable to capture them. 41 See Van Ewijk (1997) for an estimation of the huge welfare loss that taxpayers would incur if the public investment program of the Netherlands had to be financed fully through taxes. 42 A classic reference is Musgrave (1939) .

This imposes an even more demanding informational burden than the permanent balance rule, as it requires constructing a complete balance sheet of the public sector and estimating the net worth impact of alternative fiscal policy paths. These requirements clearly restrict the applicability of net worth rules. Nevertheless, net worth measures and targets have featured for some time among the core principles of fiscal management in New Zealand (Janssen 2001) , 48 and have featured prominently also in some proposals for reform of the European Stability Pact. 49 To confront the limitations of both the golden rule and the permanent balance (and net worth) rule, Mintz and Smart (2006) have recently proposed a compromise solution: a modified golden rule allowing debt finance of public investment in \"selfliquidating\" assets -i.e., those that that generate future user fee and/or tax revenue for the government so as to \"pay for themselves\" (such as in the case of utilities) --but not of investment in assets that provide services at no charge. Further, government borrowing would be limited to some fraction of the value of the revenue-generating assets, just as firms do not finance all their assets with debt. These features would result in a fiscal rule more conducive to solvency than the original golden rule, without relying as much on 47 The long-run debt / GDP ratio is not determined by the rule, but depends instead on the trajectory followed by the economy. Such indeterminacy can be avoided augmenting the rule with a long-run debt target, and letting the tax ratio adjust in response to deviations of the debt ration from the long-run target. This defines the \"extended rule\" of Buiter and Grafe (2004) . 48 The methods employed to evaluate net worth are described by Bradbury, Brumby and Skilling (1999) . 49 For example, one of the reform options outlined by Coeure and Pisani-Ferry (2003) is organized around the concept of the \"indebtedness ratio that stabilizes net worth\". potentially unreliable long-term forecasts as does the permanent balance rule, or demanding as much information as a net worth rule.",
