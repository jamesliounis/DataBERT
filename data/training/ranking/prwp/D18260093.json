        "text": "that the sensitivity to oil price volatility varies widely across countries and discusses various factors which may determine the level of sensitivity (such as sectoral composition and the energy mix). This implies that the standard approach of solely considering net oil importer-exporter status is not sufficient. Simulations of volatility shocks in hypothetical energy mixes (with increased renewable shares) illustrate the potential economic benefits resulting from efforts to disconnect the macroeconomy from volatile commodity markets. It is concluded that expanding renewable energy can in principle reduce an economy's vulnerability to oil price volatility, but a country-specific analysis would be necessary to identify concrete policy measures. Overall, the paper provides an additional rationale for reducing exposure and vulnerability to oil price volatility for the sake of economic growth.",

        "text": "As crude oil arguably constitutes one of the single most important driving forces of the global economy, oil price fluctuations are bound to have significant effects on economic growth and welfare. Indeed, the level of oil dependency of industrialized economies became particularly clear in the 1970s and 1980s, when a series of political incidents in the Middle East disrupted the security of supply and had severe effects on the global price of oil. Since then oil price shocks have continuously increased in size and frequency. While demand for oil is likely to remain relatively slow moving, mainly driven by economic growth and to some extent climate policies, supply will remain highly uncertain, not least considering persistent instability in exporting countries and the uncertainty regarding the discovery of new resources. As a result of such uncertainties, and in the context of today's tightly traded markets, future oil prices are also expected to undergo (increasingly) drastic fluctuations.",

Principally, a positive oil price shock will increase production costs and hence restrict output (henceforth denoted as 'input channel') (Barro, 1984) . Energy intensive industrial production will be more affected than service based industries. A prolonged oil price increase will necessitate costly structural changes to production processes with potentially adverse employment effects. However, it is crucial to note that the frequency of oil price shocks (both positive and negative) increases perceived price uncertainty. According to Bernanke (1983) , such oil price volatility will reduce planning horizons and cause firms to postpone irreversible business investments ('uncertainty channel').",

        "text": "Due to countless possible exogenous supply shocks, oil prices are subject to uncertainty at any point in time. Even when prices remain relatively stable over an extended period of time, a sudden exogenous event could disrupt the balance independently of previous events and cause significant upward or downward price changes (e.g. a large earthquake may reduce economic activity and the demand for crude oil accordingly, hence reducing prices). When prices are stable, economic agents (incl. households, firms and governments) tend to overlook the ubiquitous, permanent underlying uncertainty, when making economic decisions. However, in an environment of already volatile prices, agents are more likely to take future price uncertainty into account when making investment decisions. Overall, oil price volatility typically results in an increased sense of economic uncertainty, whereas the absence of volatility may instill a false sense of stability. They are however not interchangeable terms, as uncertainty can exist in the absence of volatility.",

While there exists significant literature establishing a negative and asymmetric relationship between oil price shocks and macro-economic indicators, research has focused on actual oil price shocks rather than price volatility (and accordingly uncertainty) directly. Furthermore, emerging economies and their country specific parameters have largely been overlooked. Little has been said about why sensitivity differs across countries, and why some net exporters benefit from oil price fluctuations, while others suffer. This paper addresses these shortcomings. Like the vast majority of literature on this topic, this paper considers real, exchange rate adjusted oil prices and does not take into account taxation.",

        "text": "Given the crucial role of crude oil in the global economy, the relationship between oil prices and economic activity has received considerable attention by economists since the early 1980s. Hamilton (1983) notes that seven of eight recessions in the period 1948 to 1980 were preceded by significant oil price increases and hence establishes a causal oil-price-GDP link for the USA. Subsequently these findings were confirmed by Burbidge and Harrison (1984) , Gisser and Goodwin (1986) , Mork (1989 ), Ferderer (1996 and others. Corresponding studies for other major OECD countries by Mork et al. (1994) , Papapetrou (2001), Jim\u00e9nez-Rodr\u00edguez and Sanchez (2005) and Lardic and Mignon (2006) revealed that the negative oil-price-GDP effect prevails in virtually all industrialized economies. Furthermore, oil price volatility has also been shown to have significant impacts on stock market returns (Filis et al., 2011) , and bilateral trade (Chen and Hsu, 2013) . Findings are surprisingly similar across developed countries and extend to both net importers and exporters (e.g. UK) of oil (Mork et al. 1994) . Blanchard and Gali (2007) also recognize the economic sensitivity to oil shocks, but suggest that industrialized countries have become less sensitive since the 1970s for various reasons, including reduced reliance on oil as an input factor to industrial production.",

Using the same realized volatility measure, Rafiq et al. (2009) extend Cunado and Gracia's (2005) study by analyzing the effects of oil price volatility for various macro-indicators in the Thai economy. In a vector auto-regression (VAR) and vector error correction model, they show that the realized volatility of oil prices Granger causes GDP growth, investment, unemployment and inflation. Impulse response functions confirm that impacts of realized volatility are most distinct in the short-run, particularly for GDP. This result, together with the variance decomposition, supports Bernanke's (1983) theoretical explanation of postponed investments due to expected oil price volatility and the associated uncertainty.",

        "text": "To understand the nature of the oil-GDP relationship, it is crucial to consider the existence of asymmetry, i.e. adverse effects of oil price increases exceed stimulating effects of oil price decreases. However, the empirical evidence for the nature of this asymmetry is ambiguous. While it is generally agreed that increases have adverse effects, evidence for the effects of decreases is far from conclusive. Mork (1989) distinguishes between positive and negative oil price shocks and finds that oil price increases reduce GDP while decreases have hardly any impact. However, Mork et al. (1994) find that oil price increases and decreases both have negative consequences for the US economy, while results for the UK, Japan, France, Norway, Germany and Canada are inconclusive. Mory (1993) and Lee et al. (1995) find that oil price decreases have no impact on the US economy. Lardic and Mignon (2006) show that standard cointegration is rejected for most of the twelve European sample countries, while asymmetric cointegration is determined to be of major relevance in explaining the impact of oil price shocks. The underlying reasoning is that asymmetry is caused by asymmetric monetary policy, i.e. more drastic policy measures in response to oil price increases, than to decreases (Hamilton and Herrera, 2004) . Ferderer (1996) indeed confirms a strong link between oil price shocks and monetary policy responses, but nevertheless argues that oil prices Granger cause GDP directly. Hence he concludes that asymmetric monetary policy alone is not sufficient to account for the asymmetric oil-GDP relationship. In addition to monetary policy, downward stickiness of wages and prices due to, e.g. institutional regulation or contractual commitments, is a standard explanation for asymmetric effects. For the purposes of this study asymmetry is of major importance: While in a symmetric scenario a positive and a negative oil price shock would cancel each other, in an asymmetric setting the presence of price movements (i.e. volatility) per se will impact on economic indicators.",

Industrial production series and consumer price indices are obtained from the IMF Intl. Finance Statistics database and seasonally adjusted 4 . A 'global oil price' is obtained by deflating an average of the WTI and Brent spot market prices (in USD/barrel) using a price index for non-fuel primary commodities. To obtain a more accurate measure of the domestically 'perceived' oil price, the global oil price is adjusted for the respective country's daily $-exchange rate and inflation. Hence, for each country a time series of continuous daily oil prices is obtained, with , where = [June, 1. ,1983; June, 2. ,1983; . . . , ; Jan. ,31. ,2011] ; i.e. 7017 observations. It should be noted that adjusting global oil prices for domestic exchange rate and inflation effects is common practice in this literature (see for instance Mork et al., 1994 and Abeysinghe, 2001 ) -however it should also be pointed out that such domestic oil prices reflect the perceived prices before any kind of policy intervention. In practice oil prices tend to be distorted further through fiscal policies, such as taxes or subsidies (for a detailed discussion of fuel pricing see Kojima, 2013) . 1 illustrates that oil prices have undergone considerable fluctuations in the period 1983-2011, with the global nominal oil price varying between US$ 145.7 (03/07/2008) and US$ 8.7 (25/07/1986) with a standard deviation of US$ 25.7",

        "text": "Strikingly, in all countries industrial production responds negatively to an unexpected positive volatility shock (ceteris paribus). Notably, this includes both net oil importers and exporters. The negative effects on economic activity are the strongest in the second month after the shock -with the exception of Malaysia (first month). These impulse responses are found to be statistically significant. However, positive rebound effects (third month) in Germany, S.Korea and India are associated with low t-ratios. Overall it is confirmed that effects on economic activity do not persist: the system absorbs a realized volatility shock within twelve months. This also implies that the VAR-processes meet the stability condition. Following Lee et al. (1995) and Jones et al. (2004) , it is possible to approximate the total impulse response of industrial production to a realized volatility shock, with the accumulated impulse response over twelve months (cf. Table 6 .). As Awerbuch and Sauter (2005) summarize, standard literature estimates the US economy to contract by approximately 0.5% following a 10% oil price increase. The accumulated IRF however suggests a mere 0.021% contraction following a 10% increase in oil price volatility. This discrepancy is best understood by considering a specific example: From 2008m01 to 2008m7 the US real oil price increased by 30.1% from $86.3 to $123.5. This corresponds to a 1.5% GDP contraction according to standard literature. However, in the same period the realized volatility measure increased by a factor 15, which would be associated with a 3.2% contraction of US Industrial Production according to the accumulated impulse response functions. In Malaysia realized volatility increased by a factor 12.5 in the same period -implying a 10.1% contraction of industrial production. In light of this drastic contraction, it is important to bear in mind that national output in Malaysia depends strongly on oil revenues: the state owned oil and gas company Petronas accounted for 40% of government revue in 2008 (CIA, 2011).",

In the literature (e.g. Cunado and Garcia, 2004) it is suggested that the sectoral composition of an economy is one critical factor determining how sensitive an economy is to oil prices. This is based on the reasoning that industrial production is particularly energy and commodity reliant, and will thus be more strongly affected by oil prices. Blanchard and Gali (2007) for instance show that relying less on oil in industrial production processes has reduced sensitivity in developed countries. In addition, developed economies are typically more service intensive, while their industrial sector often benefits from efficient technology making it less energy intensive.

        "text": "However, it appears that factors other than the sectoral composition also influence a country's sensitivity. For instance, Figure 8 suggests that domestic oil consumption-production ratios may also play a role in determining the level of sensitivity. For instance, the USA and India have had significant domestic oil production, which accounted for 46.8% and 38.6% respectively of domestic consumption throughout the sample period. This implies that these countries could cater for a significant percentage of consumption domestically, rather than relying on volatile external markets. Contrarily, in Japan, Germany and S.Korea domestic production is negligible relative to consumption. Accordingly these countries rely heavily on imports from international markets and thus expose themselves to global market volatility. Figure 7 also shows that Malaysia's domestic production has significantly exceeded consumption throughout the sample period. The fact that Malaysia has been estimated to be most sensitive to oil price volatility hence appears to contradict the logic that domestic oil production can reduce sensitivity to oil price uncertainty. However, the domestic consumption-production ratio may translate into the import-export ratio in different ways -domestically produced oil is not necessarily directly consumed domestically, if for instance refining capacities are insufficient. In this case even oil producing countries may need to export large quantities of domestically produced unrefined fuel, and in return import refined oil from international markets, thus exposing themselves to market volatility. Figure 7 also shows that in the USA and India, which both have significant domestic oil production, exports were negligible relative to imports. Malaysia however, despite significant domestic production, has considerable imports, servicing close to 40% of domestic demand in 2007, and as such is the third largest oil importer among all net oil exporters 10 . Under these conditions a global oil price increase raises export revenues, but also raises import costs. An increase in oil price volatility however is likely to have negative effects on both export revenues and consumption. Therefore, it is possible that even net exporters can suffer from positive oil price shocks, if imports are of significant size, and negative effects offset increased export revenue. In Malaysia this effect is likely to have been re-enforced by its sectoral composition, as well as a technological lack of alternative energies: The Malaysian energy portfolio consists of 96.6% fossil fuels.",

Like Malaysia, Norway is to be classified as a net oil exporter, whereas the relative dimensions of oil consumption, production, imports and exports require a clear distinction between the two. In Norway 91% of domestic production is exported and imports are less than 5% the size of exports. Furthermore, 60% of its energy demand is serviced by renewable energies, while the remainder is accounted for by domestic fossil fuel production; i.e. largely independently of global oil markets. Thus, a given global oil price increase is less likely to harm the Norwegian economy, but may increase its revenues from oil 10 Countries with expensive or limited refining capacities often export domestically produced non-refined oil, and import refined oil. exports.

        "text": "However, running similar time series analysis as for the countries in our original sample, results suggest that Norway's economic activity does suffer from increased oil price volatility: The Granger-causality test confirms that oil price volatility has a causal impact on economic activity. The accumulated impulse response of industrial production to a realized volatility shock amounts to -0.0037 (similar to India). Intuitively, Norway's economy is bound to be sensitive to oil price volatility, as the petroleum industry accounts for 48% of all exports and 33% of government revenue. This illustrates that countries can indeed benefit from an oil price increase under certain conditions, but not from increased price volatility. The comparison of Malaysia and Norway illustrates how oil price uncertainty may negatively affect an economy through its international trading activities, as these cause consumption or revenue uncertainty respectively. While on the demand-side Norway is largely decoupled from global oil market fluctuations, its export revenues are highly exposed. Similarly, Malaysia is exposed to uncertainty due to significant oil imports and exports. Overall this supports the claim that merely considering net-oil-exporter/importer status is not sufficient, and that country-specific transmission channels of oil price volatility need to be investigated. To further understand a country's level of exposure to oil price uncertainty, we consider its energy generating portfolios ('energy mix'), which contain elements of higher and lower price volatility. Broadly speaking, all fossil fuels (mainly coal, natural gas, crude oil) are highly price volatile, as they are sensitive to exogenous supply shocks. As most countries strongly rely on fossil fuels as their main energy source 11 (globally 87%), they are thought to 'import' this uncertainty from global markets into their national generating portfolios. As fossil fuels are highly cross-correlated (cf . Table 8 ), reducing the percentage of oil in the overall energy mix is unlikely to reduce the effects of price uncertainty, if the overall percentage of fossil fuels remains constant. To reduce the overall exposure to volatility, it is necessary to increase the elements of lower price volatility in energy generating portfolios. In this sense, the main alternatives to fossil fuels (nuclear and renewable energies), both classify as 'low volatility' assets, as they are sourced independently of volatile global fossil markets (i.e. domestically). While this study focuses on renewable energies, nuclear energy is also argued to be an important carbon-free source of energy with various benefits such as being non-location specific and scalable (see Kessides, 2010 , for an evaluation). Another useful special case to consider in this context is Iceland: Similar to the previous example of Norway it has large share of renewable energy (73%), and meets its energy needs largely through geothermal power. However, while Norway relies heavily on revenues from oil exports, Iceland's trading activities with crude oil are insignificant. Thus, Iceland has little exposure to global oil price fluctuations and is largely de-coupled from global oil markets. Indeed, for Iceland the null hypothesis \u0397 0 \u2032 :\"RV does not Granger Cause IP\" cannot be rejected at 5% (nor 10%) significance -hence oil price volatility cannot be confirmed to have a causal effect on industrial production. Furthermore, in a vector autoregressive setting lagged realized volatility is found to have no significant explanatory power for current industrial production. This suggests that Iceland may have successfully reduced its sensitivity to oil price volatility by increasing the low-variance, renewable share in the generating portfolio.",

These figures serve as a stylized illustration of the inverse relationship, suggesting that lowering the fossil share in the energy mix will in principle increase the resilience of an economy to oil price volatility (i.e. reduce its exposure and vulnerability). However, in practice oil prices can still have a significant impact on energy prices, even if the fossil share is small, for instance if national energy prices are determined by marginal prices.
