It develops a model of women's life-cycle, in which women make sequential fertility decisions. Expectations about the life horizon and child survival depend on women's perceived exposure to HIV infection, which is allowed to differ from the actual exposure. In the model, women form beliefs about their HIV status and about their own and their children's survival in future periods. Women update their beliefs with survival to each additional period as well as when their HIV status is revealed by an HIV test.",

First, I simulate life-cycle fertility in an environment with no HIV exposure. The results indicate that the presence of HIV has an average negative eect on fertility. Overall, women in the no-HIV environment have on average 0.15 more births over their life-cycle. However, there is heterogeneity in the eect of the presence of HIV on fertility, with some women decreasing the number of births and fewer women increasing it. I also simulate the eects of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and HIV testing programs on fertility outcomes. Although these programs are not necessarily intended to inuence fertility, they have the potential to aect reproductive choices by altering beliefs about HIV status, life expectancy, and child survival. Such policy interventions are implemented in Malawi and are continuously expanding in scope. I nd these programs to have negligible eects on the overall number of births. However, elimination of mother-to-child transmission will reduce fertility by infected women who respond to child mortality by additional pregnancies either because they have high marginal utility of an additional child or because they assign low likelihood to being infected.

Wolpin (1984) presents an estimable dynamic discrete-choice fertility model in an environment where infant survival is uncertain and uses the model to study the response of fertility choices to experienced infant mortality. Mira (2007) Hotz et al. (1997) , Schultz (1997) , and Wolpin (1997) survey the literature on fertility. Mira (2007) . Specically, a woman makes annual decisions of whether to become pregnant beginning at the age of her marriage and ending when she becomes infecund at a xed age F (assumed to be 45). A woman gives birth in the period following the one in which she became pregnant. If never infected, a woman survives with certainty to age T (assumed to be 60). An infected woman might die prior to reaching the terminal model period. HIV infection of a mother at time of birth also increases mortality probabilities of children of ages zero to three. Given that HIV infection is asymptomatic for the majority of the infection duration, women cannot observe their HIV status.",

Given that the non-pecuniary cost of pregnancy is not aected by beliefs about HIV status, this implies that the woman would be less likely to get pregnant if she assigns higher probability to being infected. On the other hand, if a woman has high valuation for children, she might choose to increase her fertility when she assigns some probability to being infected. She would do so in expectation that a larger share of her children will not survive. In addition, even without a change in the total number of births a woman gives, the presence of HIV might change the timing of her pregnancies. A woman might assign no or small likelihood to being infected in the present but decide to give birth at younger ages if she perceives a higher likelihood to being infected in the future.

Table 3 shows the average number of beans. The overall sample average is 1.52 beans. The average number of beans chosen in each region conforms to the ranking of HIV prevalence in the general MDICP sample. The averages are 1.78 beans in Balaka, 1.69 in Mchinji, and 1.16 in Rumphi. The 2004 HIV prevalence rates for these regions are 7.9 percent in Balaka, 6.4 percent in Mchinji, and 4.4 percent in Rumphi . The table also shows that average beliefs decrease with schooling and are higher for women married to a polygamous husband. Respondents were asked to list all of the children ever born to them, but year of birth is missing for children who died more than two years before the interview. I therefore use only birth outcomes reported for the years 2004 to 2007. Depending on the year of marriage, year of birth, and the rounds in which the woman participated, I observe between 1 and 4 potential fertility years for women of ages 16 to 45. In total, I observe 3,148 years of potential fertility with births in 920 of them (29.2 percent). Table 4 shows the annual birth probabilities of married women by 5-year age groups. The annual birth probabilities decrease from 0.405 for ages 16 to 20 to 0.06 for ages 41 to 45. ",

In 2006 and 2008, rapid blood tests were adopted, eliminating the time delay between testing and provision of results.For my analysis, I am using a subsample of married women in their rst marriage, who did not become pregnant from a relationship with men other than their future husbands prior to marriage. I restrict the sample to women in unbroken rst marriages because I abstract from modeling any decisions related to marriage or partnership. I also restrict thesample to include only women who were interviewed in at least one of the 2006 and 2008 rounds. Data collected in these rounds include family rosters, containing information on all children of respondents, and the elicitation of subjective expectations. I exclude women who were born before 1960, because the last age of fertility in the model is assumed to be 44 and 2004 is the earliest year included for fertility outcomes. After excluding additional women for missing information, the estimation sample consists of 1006 women. Tables 1 to 4 and Figures 1 and 2 provide descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis. The average age of women in the sample is 26.6 in 2004. 29 percent of the sample resides in Balaka (south), 35 percent in Mchinji (center), and 36 percent in Rumphi (north). The median number of years of schooling is 5. The women in Balaka have the lowest schooling levels with 31 percent of women never having attended school and only three percent having attended some secondary school. The women in Rumphi have the highest schooling levels, with 99 percent of women ever having attended school and 26 percent some secondary school. The average age of marriage in the overall sample is 17.5 and is similar across regions. Polygamy is most prevalent in Rumphi, with 33 percent of the women in the sample from that region married to a polygamous husband. The share of polygamous women is 27 percent in Mchinji and 20 percent in Balaka. As shown inTable 2, HIV testing take-up rates were high in all the rounds: 87.9 percent in 2004, 93.3 percent in 2006, and 94.6 percent in 2008.

A woman receiving a negative test result, for example, might not change by much her survival expectations if she believes she is in high risk of getting infected in the periods just after the test.The results of simulating testing at age of marriage and ages 25 and 35 are presented in Panels D, E, and F respectively. 1.3 percent of women are simulated to be infected at the time of their marriage, 4.1 percent at age 25 and 5.7 percent at age 35. At ages 25 and 35, women have already given 3.3 and 6.1 births on average. All three simulations result in a negligible eect on the average number of births and child mortality women experience over their life-cycle. As expected, type 0s and 1s, who assign probabilities of zero and 0.03 to the accuracy of the test result, do not alter their choices. Type 2s all receive negative test results. However, given the probability of 0.21 they assign to the accuracy of the test results and their high perceived risk of infection, the total average number of births they give does not change. Type 3s, who assign the highest probability of 0.76 to the accuracy of the test results, reduce their fertility after receiving a positive test result. The group that received a positive test result at the time of marriage reduced the average number of births by 0.42, from 4.98 to 4.56. The women of type 3 who receive a positive test result at ages 25 and 35 have 0.39 and 0.21 fewer births. The smaller eect at age 35, relative to that when tests were given in earlier ages, is partially due to the fact that mortality from HIV accelerates with age, leaving the women fewer periods during which to make fertility choices. Finally, in Panel G of Table 15 I present a simulation of a scenario in which women are oered a test at age 25. Unlike the former testing simulations, women perceive the test result as accurate and fully update their beliefs after receiving a test result. There is a negligible eect on the overall average number of births and experienced child mortality. There is very little impact on the fertility behavior of women who receive a negative test result. Women who receive a positive test result, however, see an average reduction of 0.19 in the number of births. HIV-positive women of type 0 and 1, who do not reduce fertility in the results presented in Panel E, have 0.07 and 0.05 less births in this environment. Type 3s who receive a positive test result have 0.57 fewer births than in the baseline environment. 7 Conclusion In this paper, I specied and structurally estimated a dynamic model of fertility in an environment with high HIV prevalence. My analysis takes into account uncertainty about HIV status and the discrepancies between perceived and actual exposure to HIV infection. Women's perceptions about their exposure to HIV infection and about their own HIV status aect their beliefs about their own and their children's life expectancy. Beliefs about life expectancies, in turn, aect fertility choices by changing the prole of expected lifetime utilities associated with each choice. I estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood with longitudinal data from the Malawi Diusion and Ideational Change Project, which contain measures of subjective beliefs about own HIV status. The model ts well the fertility patterns in the data, as well as the distribution of reported beliefs about own HIV status. Model simulations are informative about how HIV aects fertility and about the impact of policies aimed at reducing HIV, such as HIV testing programs and provision of antiviral therapy, on fertility and child mortality. Results show that the presence of HIV reduces fertility, both for women who are infected and who are not infected. The presence of HIV reduces the average number of life-cycle births by 0.15. I also nd that HIV testing is eective at reducing fertility of infected women, leading to a reduction in child mortality and orphan hood; however, the partial updating of beliefs following a test mitigates this eect. I also nd that prevention of mother-to-child transmission through dissemination of antiviral drugs would have a negligible eect on the average number of life-cycle births, although it reduces the incidence of child mortality.",
