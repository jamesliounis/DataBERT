These constraints are also common in other regions (e.g., Africa), so efforts to document IGM on a global scale have taken an alternative path given by the measurement of mobility in education. These measures are of interest in and of themselves, but they are also a proxy for economic status given the close relationship between education and income.",

However, analyzing IGM at a more geographically disaggregated level, as argued in Narayan et al. (2018) , is valuable because it can help researchers understand the importance of localized patterns and drivers of IGM, as shown for the case of developed countries. Along these lines, Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez (2014) state that the United States can be better described as a collection of societies, some of which are \"lands of opportunity\" with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in which only a few children escape poverty. Thus far, this type of analysis has not been conducted in LAC countries as a whole due to the inadequacy of most survey data for this purpose. This paper fills that gap in the literature by generating estimates of IGM in education at smaller geographical levels.",

The analysis covers 24 countries spanning more than half a century (between 1960 and 2012) . I rely on samples of co-residents (i.e., children living with their parents or older relatives). To minimize the impact of coresidence, I investigate mobility in education at the bottom of the educational attainment distribution by focusing on primary education, which can be measured with a high degree of confidence between ages 14 and 18. Furthermore, an important share of the population does not attain more than primary education in the period analyzed and this focus allows me to create indicators that are directly comparable to the estimates recently generated for 27 countries in Africa (see Alesina, Hohmann, Michalopoulos, & Papaioannou, 2021) , a continent that shares the feature of having high levels of income inequality despite its lower levels of income and higher poverty rates.",

In LAC, the distance between the most and least upwardly mobile countries is similar to what has been recently documented in Africa, although the least mobile countries in Africa are less mobile than the least mobile country in LAC. I find only small differences by gender, but I do document a declining trend in the mobility gap between urban and rural populations. At the sub-national level, there is heterogeneity in mobility across districts/provinces, and some countries show lower levels of mobility in the northern regions (e.g., Brazil), whereas the opposite is true for Mexico. However, the variability is much lower in countries with lower number of regions and less population. The level of mobility at the sub-national level is highly positively correlated to the share of primary completion of the previous generation, which suggests a high level of inertia. In addition, geographical correlates do not appear to be highly correlated to mobility except for distance to the capital.",

(2018) that focus on 18 countries from Latin America. This paper expands over them in terms of country coverage of the region and cross-country comparability. In addition, these estimates use the same type of data of recent estimates available for Africa, allowing a cross-regional comparison that was not available. 3 On the other hand and more closely related to this paper, it contributes to the pool of studies using administrative data or census data. For instance, Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2021) study mobility among different marginalized groups and analyze geographic differences in India; Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2022) use 1940 census data to study the role of school quality in mediating upward mobility in the US; Van der Weide, Ferreira de Souza, and Barbosa (2020) study mobility at the sub-national level in Brazil; and most closely related to this paper, Alesina et al. (2021) document patterns of IGM in Africa using census data and estimate regional childhood exposure effects using migrants. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to document IGM at a very disaggregated regional level for almost the entire population in LAC.",

In contrast, in this paper, I use census data obtained from IPUMS International (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, IPUMS, 2019), hosted at the University of Minnesota Population Center, which reports harmonized representative samples (typically 10%) of full census micro data sets for a large number of countries. In particular, I use 91 samples of population and housing censuses from 24 countries, which are run to compute the total population and contain an educational attainment question in their questionnaire. 4 The key advantage of this data set is that it contains the entire population (or at least a large share of it publicly available) at a point in time, allowing me to analyze mobility at a very disaggregated geographical level. However, the main disadvantage of this data set is that it does not link all the individuals with their parents because both (individuals and parents) need to be part of the same household.

However, Munoz and Siravegna (2021) show that the average coresidence bias when computing upward mobility (measured as the likelihood of completing primary for those whose parents did not complete primary) for individuals aged 21-25 years (with coresidence rates of less than 50% on average) is approximately 2%. In addition, the ranking obtained using these coresident samples closely follows the one obtained with a sample that includes all children (the Spearman rank correlation between the estimates with the full sample and those with coresident samples is 0.91). Given these findings, the potential for coresidence bias in my estimates is small as they are computed using individuals aged 14-18 (or 14-25) years, a group with much higher rate of coresidence. 6",

I find a positive gap that has been declining from 36 percentage points (i.e., upward mobility in urban areas is on average 36 percentage points higher than in rural areas for the cohort born in years [1950] [1951] [1952] [1953] [1954] [1955] [1956] [1957] [1958] [1959] to 20 percentage points as one moves towards older birth cohorts. Similarly, the gap in downward mobility is closing from below moving from 29 percentage points for 1950 birth decade to 15 percentage points for 1980 birth decade. Figure A14 and Figure A15 in the Appendix show estimates by sub-population rather than the gap between them for countries with data for at least 4 decades, suggesting that the gap has been decreasing because of an increase (decrease) in upward (downward) mobility.",

I estimate upward and downward mobility 17 by country, birth decade of the \"children\" and gender. I do not find systematic differences by gender for older birth cohorts but it appears that there is a trend towards higher upward mobility for women as they have 3 percentage points higher upward mobility in the 1980s birth cohort (see Figure 8) while the gap in downward mobility move around similar values (the gap in favor of women is approximately 3 percentage points for 1980s birth cohort) with a flatter trend. Figure A16 and Figure A17 in the Appendix show estimates by sub-population rather than the gap between them for countries with data for at least 4 decades, suggesting that the gap has been increasing in favor of women because of an increase (decrease) more than proportional for them in upward (downward) mobility.",

This limits the analysis of trends over time and the conclusions that can be derived from comparisons between them at given points in time or for a given cohort. Nevertheless, I document estimates of mobility by country for the different birth cohorts that are available. Figure 9 reports these estimates. It is clear how the level of upward mobility has been increasing at the same time that downward mobility has been falling. This is not surprising given the fact that educational attainment has increased in 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s other countries mean among countries with data 1950s-1980s (b) Downward mobility Notes: These estimates correspond to the probability of completing at least primary education for those whose parents did not finish primary school in the case of upward mobility and probability of not completing primary education for those whose parents completed primary school in the case of downward mobility. They are estimated by country, birth decade of the \"children\" and gender. III.2 Spatial variation of intergenerational mobility in LAC Table 3 summarizes the estimates of mobility at the province level. These results show that there are countries with substantial variance in mobility levels across provinces. This is for example the case of Paraguay, Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Peru, where the difference in upward mobility between the most upwardly mobile to the least upwardly mobile is more than half the range found in the case of countries in Latin America. However, there are also particular cases with either high or low upward mobility at the country level and a very small variation within country, such as Jamaica and Haiti, although somewhat expected as they correspond to countries with small number of administrative units and population.",

For example, Mexico shows a somewhat lower level of upward mobility in the south and you can identify a lighter spot in the middle of the country that corresponds to the region of the capital. In contrast, Brazil shows much lower level of mobility in the northern regions and higher mobility in the East coast near the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

I also consider other characteristics of the districts that are proxies of the level of development at the beginning of the period of study.These are the urban share of the population, the share of employment in agriculture, the share of employment in industry, and the share of employment in service. These last four covariates are computed restricting the sample to only individuals born before 1960."

In contrast to the estimates that focus on primary education, these measures are computed using individuals between ages 19 and 25. First, I estimate upward and downward mobility considering secondary education instead of primary. Second, I estimate upward mobility as the likelihood of finishing at least secondary education for those whose generation above were not able to complete primary school. These indicators are more prone to suffer from coresidence bias but they still provide valuable information. For example,Munoz and Siravegna (2021) show that the rank correlation between indicators of upward mobility using secondary level computed with all children versus coresidents is approximately 0.86."
