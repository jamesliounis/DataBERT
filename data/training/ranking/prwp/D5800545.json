Conditions in such areas vary widely from dismal, temporary shelter in squatter settlements to relatively well-constructed, informal housing that may persist for many decades. Common characteristics include uncertain tenure status, poor basic services such as water and sanitation, low-grade construction and overcrowded living conditions. Apart from physical deprivation, slum dwellers also often face more subtle disadvantages such as poor integration with the rest of the city and the social stigma attached to an inferior residential location.",

        "text": "With continuing rapid growth of urban areas, improving the life of slum dwellers is high on the agenda of national governments and the international community. The Millennium Development Goals, for instance, advocate significant improvements in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 (United Nations 2005) . Over the last several decades, strategies to achieve better living conditions of slum dwellers have included sites and services programs, resettlement to new housing developments, and land titling. We will not discuss the merits of these strategies in detail in this paper. Each strategy has had its share of success stories and failures. Given the scale of the problem, we argue instead that all available options need to be at the disposal of policy makers and adapted to local conditions, including strategies that enable slum dwellers to leave informal settlements. This is the focus of this paper in which we investigate what enables people to move out of a slum area into the formal housing market. For many households, slum areas are not just temporary residences, but are homes for many decades. Yet, some residents manage to move out into the formal housing market. The main question in this paper is why some households manage to use the informal housing market as a stepping stone towards improved housing, while for others, slums essentially become poverty traps. More specifically, in this paper we investigate the determinants of residential mobility in Bhopal, India, using a comprehensive household level data set. We are particularly interested in the personal and household characteristics that enable slum dwellers to graduate to formal housing categories-in our survey sample, one in five households succeeds in getting out of a slum settlement. We find that in the absence of formal housing finance options, the ability of households to accumulate savings significantly improves their chances for moving out of slums.",

Globally, almost one billion people live in slums according to UN estimates (United Nations 2003) . To address this problem, development agencies and national governments have supported a range of shelter related programs (Werlin 1999, Sivam and Karuppannan 2002; Mukhija 2002; Buckley and Kalarickal 2004) . Initially, policies favored sites and services programs where infrastructure could be provided relatively cheaply on newly developed land. In Indian cities, most settlement sites were at the urban periphery, where the cost of network services extension is considerable and commuting to urban jobs expensive. Resettlement programs were managed within relatively low budgets by providing a low level of services. With the persistence of large slum areas and the realization that many slums could not be simply removed, urban upgrading projects became more widespread. Retrofitting existing settlements with better services is usually more expensive, but it avoids the social disruption of moving residents into new greenfield developments.",

        "text": "The question of resettlement versus in-situ upgrading raises a dilemma. Moving slum dwellers to new housing in other parts of the city can destroy the social networks on which slum dwellers rely for income and other support. Even if entire communities get moved, residents may lose their access to jobs and services that were available in the old, often more centrally located informal settlement. With slum upgrading, on the other hand, service quality may be improved, but the social stigma attached to living in a slum location remains, even after living conditions have improved. Perlman (2003) provides evidence from slums in Rio de Janeiro to suggest that the stigma of having a residential address in a squatter settlement has adverse consequences on the probability of getting a job. There is also a growing body of analytic work showing that neighborhood attributes may affect economic and social outcomes through the behaviors, attitudes or characteristics of others who live within the same area. Examples are the ability of neighbors to provide job referrals or peer group effects on educational performance of children.",

But they tend to be costly, are subject to lengthy legal challenges, may encourage selling out to better off residents, and often reward those who illegally occupied land owned by the state or others. Development agencies therefore often shy away from full-scale land titling projects. Housing policy reform can help overcome housing supply constraints by removing burdensome and ineffective barriers to housing investment. This includes regulatory reform such as removal of floor-area ratios and financial sector restructuring (Diamond 2000; Bertaud, Buckley and Owens 2003; Bertaud and Bruckner 2004) . Such reform may lead to lower housing prices and greater affordability, making formal dwellings accessible to lower income residents.",

        "text": "To complement policy development aimed at direct intervention and regulatory reform, it is equally important to understand how people manage to transition from slums into the formal housing market in the absence of targeted policies or projects. This paper identifies characteristics of slum dwellers who manage to move out of informal settlements and discusses policies that may support this transition. Among these factors we specifically consider the role of savings. The Indian housing market can be classified into several broad segments: an informal market, composed of dwelling units in squatter settlements, but also including resettlement layouts and unauthorized layouts; and a formal market, composed of publicly produced housing units and private developers. Although the focus of our study is on a comparison of slums versus more formal housing, these categorizations hide considerable heterogeneity in the structural and regulatory characteristics of different types of housing supply mechanisms that are common to most Indian cities (see also, e.g., Sivam 2002 Sivam , 2003 . Table 1 shows the distribution of our sample across housing categories encountered in Bhopal. About 30 percent live in notified and non-notified slum and squatter settlements. Although squatter settlements are spontaneous developments to start with, their consolidation is driven by organized groups of landgrabbers. While squatter housing may be initially developed by households on open lands in close proximity to employment centers, these settlements get consolidated by groups who construct dwellings for sale and rental purposes. Figure 2 shows the distribution of welfare levels across households in six broad housing categories, where the welfare measure is per capita annual household consumption in Rupees. There is significant variance within each housing category with households in slums having the lowest consumption expenditures. 3, unauthorized colonies (4), public housing (5,6,7&8), private housing (9) and historic core (10), see Table 1 .",

Residents were asked about the type of housing, tenure status, and access to basic services in their previous residences.

Eighteen percent moved to resettlement areas, 11 percent to unauthorized colonies and about 35 percent to various types of publicly provided housing developments.

An obvious point of departure is housing finance in an environment where formal credit tends to be accessible only to wealthier households. Apart from informal credit suppliersmoneylenders, pawnbrokers or friends and relatives-personal savings constitute a large proportion of housing finance, particularly for low-income households who are often employed in the informal sectors. For four cities in India in the mid 1980s, Lall (1989) shows that this proportion was higher in smaller towns due to lower overall incomes as well as the limited potential for institutional financial support. In Delhi, for instance, about 14 % of informal sector households had access to formal housing finance, while in two small towns-Cuttack and Quilon-the share was less than seven percent. Own savings, in contrast, provided housing finance for between 38% in Lucknow to almost 95% in Cuttack.",

Even though there has been some liberalization and reform in the housing and finance sectors, these developments have mostly benefited middle and higher income households (Sivam and Karuppannan 2002) . This is also reflected in our survey data from Bhopal. We find that most of the 1652 sample households who own their dwelling unit had to rely solely on personal savings to finance their ho mes. Access to housing finance is very limited, with 74 percent of all survey households relying only on own sources for financing their homes (Table 4 ). In addition, 14.5 percent rely on informal non-commercial borrowing to finance housing purchases. Similar to Igel and Srinivas (1996) , we distinguish informal credit by transactional credit suppliers, such as money lenders or pawnbrokers, from personal loans from family or other closely related persons who do not charge interest. Personal savings thus present the only way to home ownership for most lowincome households. Among the sample households in Bhopal, almost thirty percent manage to save regularly, either through chit fund savings or other forms. The proportion is higher in better off households. For instance, among households in public and private housing, between 43 and 58 percent of households report to save regularly. More than 60 percent of households that save do so on a monthly basis.",

A possible reason why migrants do better is that they ma y be more entrepreneurial than native slum dwellers, as reflected by their decision to move across cities or regions in search of better opportunities. While we can not offer conclusive evidence on why migrants may move out of slums at a higher rate, the survey information shows that migrants in the sample have higher educational attainment compared to natives, and most have moved to Bhopal in search of employment opportunities. Migrants may thus use slums as an initial residence after arrival before moving on into the formal housing market. Dependency ratios do not have any effect on household mobility in these estimations.

People with higher education attainment are likely to have a better understanding of the future benefits of savings as they discount benefits over a longer horizon. As the household head's own education attainment is likely to be endogenous, we use education attainment of the father of the household head as an instrument. Owning agricultural land holdings provides a safety net, increases options for consumption smoothing and may thus allow the household to save on a regular basis.

The fact that a small but significant share of low income slum households manage to save regularly-about 13 percent in our sample for Bhopaldemonstrates that there is a potential for encouraging wealth accumulation among the poor.

The survey of 2508 households was conducted between August and October 2003 and is designed to be representative of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation area across all welfare and housing categories. Approximate household locations were captured using global positioning systems receivers. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the sample in the Bhopal municipal area. The survey includes questions on welfare status, housing quality, tenure status and mobility, education attainment, skill levels, savings behavior, and asset holdings, as well as questions on quality of access to infrastructure services."
