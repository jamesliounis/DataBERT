In this paper we test this idea via a lab-in-thefield experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome, Italy. In a dictator game, migrants are asked to allocate 1000 \u20ac between themselves and people of their choice in the Philippines. Different games then allow them to explicitly set aside some of the money sent for educational purposes, varying the amount of control offered. Three levels of control are tested: the option to simply label some amount of money as for educational purposes only; labeling the funding and having it sent directly to a school to pay for a particular student's educational tuition; and combining labeled money sent direct to a school with reports on student attendance and grades. We also randomize whether the household in the Philippines is told the migrant's choices in the game, to test whether migrants are able to exhibit more control when the remittance receivers have less information.",

We use this to examine the actual demand for control over remittances for education purposes.

        "text": "The most closely related work to our paper is Ambler et al (2014) . They work with Salvadoran migrants in Washington, D.C., and examine the demand for a new financial product that allowed migrants to target remittances towards the education of a specific student they selected in El Salvador. Money was sent via an ATM card, that the student was told was intended to support their education, but for which there was no enforcement on how the money was used. They find zero demand for this product when offered by itself, but do find positive demand for the product when it is accompanied by matching funds. Our study contrasts with this finding by showing there can be positive demand from migrants for education-labeled remittances and through the use of a lab-in-the-field experiment to examine the mechanisms driving this demand. This paper also contributes to a second, related literature, which examines the role of soft and hard commitments on financial decisions. Karlan and Linden (2014) test the demand and impact of two savings accounts for education in Uganda: a school-based commitment account that can only be used for educational purposes, and a soft commitment product that was labeled for education use but could be withdrawn for any purpose. They find more savings under the weaker commitment product, suggesting individuals may wish to bind their future behavior, but not too tightly. Benhassine et al (2013) show that simply labeling a cash transfer as intended for education can have similar positive effects on school participation as imposing that transfers be conditional on school attendance. Consistent with the idea that ear-marking, or labeling, money for a specific purpose can increase saving, Soman and Cheema (2011) find that low-income Indian workers save more when salaries are earmarked, especially when pictures of the household's children are placed on the earmarked envelope. Our findings of increased remittances when migrants can label accounts, and little additional remittances from directing the payments straight to the school, suggest that soft commitments may also be enough for educational remitting.",

In particular, the standard unitary model of the household seems particularly unlikely to hold in a migration context due to information asymmetries and to limits on monitoring within the household (de Laat, 2008; Chen, 2013; Ambler, 2013 , Doi et al, 2014 ).",

The first is the extensive margin of whether or not the migrant chooses to remit any of the money at all with others in the Philippines. 87.8 percent of migrants do choose to remit in the basic, no-label option. The second outcome is the total amount remitted to anyone in the Philippines. Migrants could divide the money up with as many individuals in the Philippines as they liked, with the maximum being 9 individuals. We total this up, and find the mean amount remitted is 614.6 \u20ac under the basic, no-label option. That is, migrants are sharing more than they keep for themselves. We also consider the total number of people in the Philippines they choose to remit to (an average of 2.03 under the basic option), and the amount remitted to each beneficiary (conditional on making any remittances). Then to examine the extent to which differences are arising from changing remittance behavior with the most closely connected household, versus with other households in the Philippines, we examine the number of individuals within the most closely connected household that they choose to allocate money to, whether or not they choose to allocate money to someone outside this main household (23.8 percent do under the basic choice option), and the amount remitted to people outside the main household (90.2 \u20ac on average under the basic option). Adding the option of direct payment to the school, or direct payment and monitoring, only leads to modest changes relative to education labeling alone. Although there is a statistically significant difference between education labeling alone and the direct payment option for several outcomes, the magnitudes of these differences are relatively small. With direct payment the total amount remitted increases by 107.4 \u20ac relative to the basic, no-label option, which represents only a 2 percent higher increase than that under education labeling alone. Moreover, the last row of Table 2 shows that for all but one outcome we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equality of the three forms of directing the remittance for education purposes. The one exception is in the number of individuals in the main household that money is shared with. This is 0.06 to 0.08 persons higher with either direct payment option, a 4 to 5 percent increase on the basic option mean. Figure 1 shows the CDFs of the total amount remitted under the four choice structures. We see the change in the amount remitted when moving from the basic, no-label, option to any of the other three options occurs across the entire distribution, while the other three choices have very similar distributions to one another.",

The mean is 93.7\u20ac, with a standard deviation of 253\u20ac. We then also consider the additional difference in the total amount they choose to remit when given the further option of directing payments straight to the school versus education labeling alone. The mean for this variable is 13.8\u20ac, with a standard deviation of 156\u20ac. Again we standardize these variables in terms of hundreds of euros. Table 4 reports the results. In the first column we see that individuals who choose to remit more money via the direct payment option during the game are significantly more likely to take up the EduPay product. Each 100\u20ac more allocated to the direct payment option in the game is associated with a 2.4 percentage point higher take-up rate. A one standard deviation increase in the amount chosen to be remitted via direct payment option in the game is therefore associated with an 8.7 percentage point higher take-up rate, which represents a 32 percent increase relative to the mean take-up rate of 27.1 percent. Column 2 shows this effect continues to hold in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance once we add control variables. We also see that migrants with children in the Philippines are more likely to sign up for this product, whereas those with lower incomes are less likely to use the product.",

Strengthening this commitment from the soft commitment of labeling to the hard commitment of directly paying the school (and potentially monitoring the schooling of the sponsored student) results in little additional change in remitting behavior. Furthermore, we find behavior in this game is useful for predicting take-up of a new financial product designed to enable migrants to direct remittances to schools in the Philippines. Migrants who remit more for education purposes in the game, and who remit more with education labeling than without, are more likely to want to use this new product. The demand for the new product seems driven more by a demand for the ability to label remittances for education, than for the hard commitment entailed by paying the school directly.",

Second, schools typically took two to three weeks to provide the invoice and bank account information, and so migrants, being nervous about meeting tuition deadlines, opted to send money through other means.

The intercept points were five fixed locations :the Santa Pudenziana Filipino community church, the Bank of the Philippine Islands Rome branch, the Embassy of the Philippines, the headquarters of an important Filipino NGO (OFSPES), and the central train station in Rome (Termini Station).3 These regions, all on the island of Luzon, are: 1) Region 3 [Central Luzon];2) Region 4 [the provinces of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Rizal, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Palawan, and Romblon]; and 3) the National Capital Region (the group of contiguous cities comprising metro Manila). the migrants have a college or a university degree and have been living in Italy for about 7 years (median). Only 21 percent are never married, but only 5 percent have their spouse with them in Italy. Nearly 68 percent of the respondents are employed as domestic workers, with the other main occupations being housecleaners (8 percent) and nannies (6 percent). The median wage is 900 euros per month. Almost 96 percent have remitted regularly to the most closely connected household in the Philippines in the last 12 months, and 72 percent remit monthly. The median amount of remittances is 380 euros per month. 81 percent report having sent remittances in the past year for the specific purpose of funding the education of someone in the Philippines, with a median of 970 euros per year sent for this purpose. The most closely connected household to the migrant in the Philippines has an average of 4.45 individuals in it. The head is the migrant's parents in 29.5 percent of cases, the migrant's spouse 22.6 percent of the time, and the migrant's sister or brother in 17.2 percent of cases. 62.9 percent of migrants have one of their own children in this household, and 32.1 percent have a nephew or niece in this household. Communication between the migrant and this household is frequent, with 52 percent communicating daily, and 93 percent at least weekly. 71 percent of migrants declare themselves to be \"very well informed\" on what happens in this household.",

This last case then mimics the three key features of the EduPay product: labeling, direct payment, and monitoring.",

This results in a 4.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of remitting at all, and a 93.7 \u20ac increase in the total amount remitted, both significant at the 1 percent level. This increase in the total remitted is approximately a 15 percent increase on the amount remitted under the basic choice option. We see that this increase reflects migrants remitting to both more people (0.15 more people), and remitting more to each person that they do remit to. Most of the increase appears to be occurring within the most closely connected household, with no increase in the likelihood of remitting to someone outside this main household, and 82 percent of the total increase in remittances going to individuals inside the main household.",
