        "text": "Two emerging features of the changing patterns of trade integration suggest that the impact of specific provisions included in Economic Integration Agreements (EIAs) should be reconsidered from a broader perspective than traditional trade diversion and creation. First, tariffs on goods have been extensively bound and reduced to an average below 5%, whereas technical, sanitary, and regulatory measures at the border have spread. Second, it is often argued that progress is more easily achieved within EIAs with regard to deep trade liberalization because the multilateral scene has become too heterogeneous to converge easily on ambitious and mutually beneficial liberalization agendas. These two trends reinforce each other: the agenda of trade negotiations has shifted from tariffs to more complex issues that are hardly addressed in the multilateral arena, and EIAs offer a more versatile negotiating environment.",

Because technical regulations are typically more stringent in high-income countries, either de jure or de facto (through stricter enforcement), what is at stake in such EIAs is a convergence of standards to the more stringent Northern ones and their adoption by developing countries. There is abundant literature on the standards divide (Wilson and Abiola 2003) that indicates the potential detrimental effects of high-income countries' standards on exports from developing economies (Otsuki et al. 2001) . However, the way in which the adoption of Northern standards by Southern countries-when they manage to match them-affects trade patterns remains an open question. This is the question addressed in this paper.",

However, these benefits typically come at a cost, even if that cost is sometimes reduced by technical-assistance programs such as the European Pesticides Initiative Program, and the higher cost and changed market positioning may price those exports out of other Southern markets. The Southern partner will then redirect its exports to the Northern partner, a trade deflection that may hurt actual or potential South-South trade.",

        "text": "The size of this trade deflection is an empirical question that depends, inter alia, on how specific and stringent the standards are. When the Northern partner's standard is idiosyncratic (national or regional), the Southern partner's adaptation to that particular standard may make it costlier to also produce for other markets with different standards or, at least, may not help in those markets. For instance, adopting a standard imposed by the European Union (EU) does not necessarily facilitate clearance of the product in the United States (US). This effect may be mitigated when harmonization takes place on the basis of international standards. Although there is no theoretical argument establishing a cost hierarchy to standards and regional standards are not necessarily costlier to implement than international ones, a number of papers (see, e.g., Otsuki et al. 2001; Wilson and Otsuki 2004) have empirically shown that international standards are less trade-inhibiting than domestic or regional ones, with a smaller negative trade impact and even, in some cases, a positive one. 1 Accordingly, the main objective of our paper is to assess whether the liberalization of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) in North-South EIAs contributes to reinforcing hub-andspoke trade patterns centered on large Northern blocs, which are potentially damaging for South-South trade integration. Put differently, the hypothesis is that as a result of the deep integration associated with standards provisions included in the EIA, the Southern partners' trade expands with the North, but at the expense of their trade with non-bloc Southern partners. The net effect of these two opposite forces is a priori indeterminate and subject to empirical estimation.",

First, to the extent that the Southern partner's producers adapt their entire production processes to Northern standards, negative externalities on health or the environment may be reduced, with positive welfare effects. However, the adoption of Northern standards may raise the production costs and prices in the South and may therefore be welfare-reducing.

This equation is estimated both for trade in goods as a whole and for manufactured products only because the impact of TBTs may differ between manufactured and agricultural products. The identification of classical trade-diversion effects in a gravity equation relies on changes in importing countries' trade patterns, with imports from third countries replaced by within-bloc imports (see, e.g., Carr\u00e8re 2006) . By contrast, our identification of deflection effects relies on changes in exporting countries' trade patterns because our conjecture relies on a cost-raising effect rather than a tariff-preference one.",

        "text": "A first strand examines standards provisions in several EIAs and investigates whether they go beyond the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on TBT. These papers do not quantify the trade impact of this regional liberalization. Covering 28 EIAs where the EU or the US is a partner, Horn et al. (2009) show that all but two US agreements include TBT provisions. Furthermore, for five EU and 11 US agreements, these provisions are legally enforceable, meaning that the agreement specifies clear legal obligations, which are more likely to be implemented. Piermartini and Budetta (2009) survey 58 EIAs with TBT provisions. They carefully analyze the legal text of these EIAS and scrutinize whether the TBT provisions refer to the WTO TBT agreement and whether regional liberalization of TBTs through harmonization or mutual recognition is pursued. They also examine transparency requirements, institutional and administrative frameworks, and cooperation between members on TBTs. Their study provides rich information. For instance, harmonization appears to be frequently used for standards and technical regulations, whereas mutual recognition is favored for conformity assessment procedures. Moreover, EIAs signed by the US promote the mutual recognition of conformity assessment procedures, whereas EIAs signed by the EU also frequently promote further harmonization of technical regulations. In view of this last observation, Piermartini and Budetta (2009) raise the issue of whether regional harmonization might lock countries into EIAs, hampering multilateral trade liberalization. However, they do not test their conjecture. Lesser (2007) extends Piermartini and Budetta's (2009) mapping to 82 EIAs, with a special focus on Chile, Singapore, and Morocco.",

        "text": "A second strand of the literature seeks to quantify the trade effects of agreements covering standards and uncovers potentially damaging effects for developing countries, in accordance with Baldwin's intuition. Chen and Mattoo (2008) examine regional standards liberalization through harmonization and mutual recognition agreements between industrial countries, controlling for the presence of rules of origin in the latter case. On the basis of a sample covering disaggregated manufacturing trade flows between 42 countries (28 OECD and 14 non-OECD countries) over 1986-2000, they find that harmonization fosters trade between member countries but reduces it with the rest of the world. Mutual recognition with rules of origin has a qualitatively similar effect, whereas mutual recognition without rules of origin increases trade both within and outside the bloc. Baller (2007) studies the trade impact on both member and non-member countries of TBT liberalization through mutual-recognition and harmonization agreements. Her analysis includes North-North, North-South, and South-South agreements and uses a two-stage gravity estimation for two sectors: Telecom equipment and medical devices. She finds that mutualrecognition agreements significantly increase the probability and volume of trade for member countries. Interestingly, third-party developed countries outside the bloc also benefit from harmonization, whereas third-party developing countries do not. Reyes (2011 Reyes ( , 2012 provides a possible explanation for Baller's result. Using detailed firm-level data, he shows that the harmonization of the EU's electronics standards on international ones in the 1990s induced entry by new US exporters, making the market more competitive and encouraging trade (in this case, with a Northern non-member). However, this change in market structure was accompanied by a retrenchment by Southern exporters on the EU markets, damaging trade with Southern non-members. It is difficult to ascertain the mechanism that induced this substitution, but one conjecture is that the EU market became tougher, inducing the exit of weaker Southern players.",

When the harmonization of domestic regulations is not explicitly called for, the argument is essentially related to production lines-that once the Southern-based producer has been forced to adapt its production processes to Northern regulations for products bound for that market, it is likely to adopt the same processes for all of its production to avoid separate production chains and higher fixed costs.

First, OLS estimation of (1) excludes zero lines and therefore raises a potential selection issue. One way to address zero flows consists of using a two-stage estimation procedure. The decision to export is estimated in the first stage, whereas the second stage focuses on the value of exports. The Heckman model is often used in the trade literature. However, in the presence of fixed effects in the first stage, the Heckman model leads to the incidental parameter problem. Helpman et al. (2008) also develop a two-stage estimation procedure that accounts for both the extensive (decision to export from i to j) and the intensive (volume of exports conditional on exporting) margins of trade. Although this approach offers a better understanding of the determinants of trade flows, it provides biased estimates in the presence of heteroskedasticity in trade data (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2009) . The RESET test (Ramsey 1969 ) performed on our data suggests the presence of heteroskedasticity in our sample. Therefore, to avoid biased estimation results, the Poisson estimator suggested by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) is used. The Poisson estimator provides estimates that are comparable to elasticity estimates from the standard linear-in-logs specification and corrects for heteroskedasticity in the error term. The performance of the Poisson estimator has been challenged in the literature on the grounds that Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) do not consider the case in which the dependent variable has a substantial proportion of zero values. However, Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2011) show that even in the presence of many zeroes, the Poisson estimator is well behaved. In addition, our data are aggregated, which reduces the proportion of zeroes in our sample.",

One approach to address this issue consists of using instrumental-variable techniques. Critical to this approach is the selection of instruments, which should be correlated with the probability of an EIA between two countries but uncorrelated with their bilateral trade flows. In their study using disaggregated data, Chen and Mattoo (2008) use standards harmonization in adjacent industries (i.e., industries classified in the same two-digit sector) as an instrument. Because our focus is on aggregated trade flows, the definition of instruments is more complex in our case. As an alternative to IV estimation, we rely on country-pair fixed effects to control for the potential endogeneity of EIAs and their clauses, following Baier and Bergstrand (2007) or Anderson and Yotov (2011) . Although this approach may not eliminate all of the potential endogeneity bias, it is intuitively plausible that standards harmonization, particularly on regional standards, correlates positively with trade flows, biasing coefficients upward. Our key result is that harmonization depresses South-South trade, and harmonization on regional standards fails to raise North-South trade. This result is unlikely to be driven by endogeneity bias. Furthermore, as highlighted by Helpman et al. (2008) and Arkolakis et al. (2012) , firm heterogeneity may bias aggregate trade flow results and affect our empirical results. However, the decision by firms to enter markets is likely dominated by cross-sectional variation. Therefore, the inclusion of country-pair fixed effects in our estimations should largely account for this potential firm-heterogeneity bias.",

Our third robustness check addresses the lagged trade effects of trade agreements and TBT harmonization. Baier and Bergstrand (2007) showed that the effect of EIAs cannot be fully captured in the year of their formation because most of them have phase-in periods. We therefore allow for gradual phasing-in of EIA and standard harmonization by including one lag for these variables in the estimation. The results are presented in column (7).

Our analysis shows that South-South trade is negatively impacted by harmonization and that North-South trade is negatively affected when the harmonization is on regional standards. Most of the action takes place in relation to regional agreements signed by the EU with developing countries. Our findings confirm Piermartini and Budetta's (2009) intuition: harmonization on a regional basis may lock countries into some EIAs and reinforces hub-and-spoke trade structures. These results call for further research, especially at the sector level. One may also explore whether differences in terms of trade impact are observable between the developing and least developed countries.",
