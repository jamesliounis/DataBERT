In the past, electricity tariffs were very low in these countries, inducing inefficient electricity consumption. Furthermore, electricity tariffs did not cover the operation costs, leading to large subsidies to utility companies and thus imposing a heavy fiscal burden on the budget. In the 1990s governments in Europe and Central Asia started to implement market reforms, including restructuring energy utility companies, liberalizing energy markets, and raising energy prices to the cost recovery level. The main objective of these reforms was to reduce fiscal subsidies, improve operational efficiency of the utility companies and raise end-user energy efficiency. However, the substantial increase in energy prices in the region has had an adverse impact on poverty and the environment when pricing reforms were not combined with measures to mitigate the losses from a price increase on the poor households.",

Along with the other countries in South East Europe, Montenegro recently signed a regional energy treaty, which commits the signatory countries to liberalize the non-residential energy market by January 1 st 2008. 2 This treaty includes a set of measures intended to support the development of a regional electricity market, such as raising electricity tariffs to the cost-recovery level, enforcing payments discipline, restructuring energy companies, establishing an independent energy regulator, revising tariff methodologies, and putting in place social safety nets to offset the adverse impact of tariff increases on vulnerable households.

        "text": "There is some debate about the appropriate cost recovery level that should be used as a benchmark in setting electricity tariff levels in Montenegro. By some estimates, electricity is no longer subsidized in Montenegro and the average residential tariff of 4.85 c\u20ac/kWh, including taxes, has reached the current short-run cost-recovery price level. 4 The long-run cost recovery level for the region is estimated around 7.0 c\u20ac/kWh and it includes the provision for investments in maintenance and upgrading of the infrastructure (Figure 1) . 5 However, the cost recovery level in Montenegro could be higher than the regional average, for example, if the country faces higher generation costs. The electric utility company in Montenegro (EPCG) is requesting the Regulatory Agency to approve an increase of the average residential electricity tariff to 10.7 c\u20ac/kWh and it has argued that an increase of this magnitude would be necessary to cover the rising labor costs and local communal taxes. This paper does not aim to resolve the debate of what is the appropriate electricity tariff level and argue in favor of a particular estimate of the cost-recovery level. Instead, we focus on an illustration of the anticipated poverty and environmental effects in several policy scenarios.",

        "text": "The Government of Montenegro faces an important policy dilemma. Residential electricity tariffs could more than double over the next four years if the regulatory agency approves the price increase requested by the electric utility company. Even a smaller increase in residential electricity tariffs to 7.0 c\u20ac/kWh is likely to be extremely unpopular. It could also give rise to environmental externalities from an increased reliance on fuelwood, the main alternative household energy source, as households switch away from electricity. However, the cost of maintaining residential tariffs at the current price level in the face of the rising cost recovery price, as our analysis shows, would be prohibitively expensive. Maintaining tariffs below cost recovery levels would also undermine the government's commitment to the development of a regional electricity market. To resolve this dilemma, the Government of Montenegro could evaluate a range of alternatives that combine the price increase with measures that would mitigate the effect of this dramatic price increase on poor and vulnerable households.",

Fuelwood is the main alternative to electricity for space heating and it is used by more than half of the population either as the only source of space heating or in conjunction with electricity. Higher electricity tariffs may result in increased demand for fuelwood, if an increase of electricity tariffs induces a significant number of households to switch to fuelwood for heating during the winter months. We investigate the potential impact of electricity tariff reforms on household heating fuel choice by estimating a fuel switching model. The switch to fuelwood for space heating could potentially have a negative impact on forest resources, particularly in the North, by inducing deforestation and on household health by increasing indoor air pollution. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that the impact of electricity tariff reforms on household choice of space heating fuels and the level of fuelwood consumption should be carefully monitored.",

In this overview of energy consumption patterns in Montenegro we focus on winter energy consumption, because space heating accounts for a substantial share of household energy consumption. Also, we want to be able to examine the trade offs between the two main sources of heating energy used during the winter months in Montenegro, which are electricity and fuelwood. Since energy consumption during the winter months is a necessity, it is not surprising that poor households spend a higher share of total expenditures on energy. Households in the poorest quintile spend more than twice as much (12.9% versus 5.2%) of their budget on energy expenditures than households in the highest quintile of the income distribution. Although many households do not heat their entire living space, energy consumption in Montenegro is very inefficient. Average energy consumption per square meter of living space in Montenegro is about 2.5 times greater than in Northern Europe, where the climate is more severe. 7 Higher electricity tariffs would encourage energy efficiency investments, however, the burden of higher electricity tariffs on the poor and their choice of heating fuel must also be considered.",

        "text": "Poverty and the choice of space heating fuel. Households in Montenegro use primarily electricity and fuelwood for heating during the winter months. We find that more than half of the population (56.6%) uses fuelwood for heating. 8 Among the poor the dependence on fuelwood is even higher, with 86 percent of poor households relying to some extent on fuelwood for heating. The percentage of households using fuelwood is higher in rural areas (79.3%) and in the northern part of the country (71.1%), where the availability of fuelwood is greater and the climate is colder. A more detailed analysis follows, examining the pattern of energy consumption geographically, by income quintile groups, and across socioeconomic groups. Table 1 reports wood and electricity expenditures as a percentage of total household expenditures for households in different income groups and regions. The regional differences in household energy consumption patterns are striking. Fuelwood expenditures are considerably higher in the North (average of 4.9% of household expenditures) and for the households in the poorest quintile in the North and Central regions (over 5% of household expenditures). Fuelwood expenditures amount to approximately half of household total energy expenditures in all income groups in the North. In contrast, households in the South spend less than 1 percent of household expenditures on fuelwood. The share of fuelwood expenditures in total energy expenditures is 20 percent or less for households in the South.",

A survey of household electricity expenditures in other eastern European and central Asian countries, shown in Figure 2 , reveals a similar pattern of electricity expenditure shares between low and high income households. Given that electricity expenditures are a substantial component of the total budget of the poorest households, an increase in electricity tariffs will likely have a major impact on their welfare. 2005For some households that use only electricity as a source of heating, the impact of higher electricity tariffs may be particularly severe. As shown in Table 2 , the share of electricity expenditures in total household budget falls across all social and economic categories as income rises. In all but three instances, the share of electricity expenditures for households in the lowest income quintile group exceeds 10 percent of household expenditures. Particularly vulnerable are poor households with disabled persons and on family material assistance, with electricity expenditures reaching 13 percent of household expenditures, and households headed by an unemployed or retired person, which have electricity expenditures shares four times higher than similar household in the highest quintile group. Thus, at current prices electricity expenditures already exceed what is considered the benchmark affordability level of 10 percent of household expenditures. 9 The next section examines how higher electricity tariffs would affect household welfare and electricity expenditure shares, particularly the burden of higher electricity tariffs for the poor and vulnerable households.",

        "text": "Estimating the welfare loss associated with higher electricity tariffs. 10 In the absence of electricity price variation to estimate a household demand function for electricity we calculate the welfare loss making different elasticity assumptions of household response to the proposed increase electricity price tariffs. The welfare loss is calculated as the loss in consumer surplus from the price increase, expressed as a percentage of total household expenditures. We assume three different electricity price elasticities. At one extreme, we assume that the price elasticity of electricity demand is zero and households do not change the quantity of electricity they consume when they face higher prices. This is our \"worst case\" scenario, in which household losses are the most significant. At the other extreme, we assume an elasticity of -1, which indicates that households' response to electricity price changes is proportional to the magnitude of the price change. In this scenario, a 10 percent increase in electricity prices generates a 10 percent reduction in electricity consumption. A more realistic case is an intermediate scenario, which assumes an elasticity of -0.5. In this scenario household demand is inelastic but it is responsive to higher electricity prices. Table 3 presents the results of the analysis of welfare losses associated with higher electricity prices. The analysis suggests the welfare losses of the poorest quintile are approximately twice as large as the welfare losses of the richest quintile. The welfare losses for the poorest households are larger because the poor spend a higher share of expenditures on energy than the non-poor. Assuming the initial reforms result in an increase of the price of electricity to 7 c\u20ac/kWh, the welfare loss of the poorest households would range from 2.66 to 3.41 percent of household expenditures. However, if households use only electricity for heating (and assuming they cannot switch to fuelwood), the welfare losses of the poorest households would range from 3.86 to 4.96 percent of household expenditures. The welfare losses are of course greater for higher electricity prices. The welfare losses assuming a zero elasticity are proportional to the price change, i.e. the welfare loss associated with a 50 percent increase in price would be twice as large as the welfare loss associated with a 25 percent increase in price. When demand is elastic, however, the rise in welfare losses is less than proportional to the price increase. 11",

We are particularly interested in the welfare losses incurred by the poorest households.

We focus on households using only electricity for heating. In this scenario it is interesting to compare the current budget share spent on electricity and the welfare losses expressed as percentage of total household expenditures. The sum of the budget share of expenditures and the associated welfare loss when the price elasticity is zero represents the total electricity expenditures for the poor at the new electricity prices, assuming that households do not switch to other energy sources for heating. This is a reasonable approximation if we believe that the household demand function is fairly inelastic, since households are likely to be consuming the minimum amount of energy necessary to withstand the cold winter temperatures. If households are already at their minimum electricity consumption level and they have no possibility to switch to other heating fuels, then the impact of higher electricity prices on household budgets would indeed be severe. Some poor households, such as those with disabled household members or receiving family material assistance, are spending 13 percent of their budget on electricity. Assuming a zero price elasticity, they would be spending nearly 20 percent of their budget on electricity if prices increase to 7 c\u20ac/kWh.",

This is because when the elasticity is not zero, the welfare losses include additional expenditures on electricity, as well as the consumer surplus loss incurred on the value of units not consumed at the higher price. Thus, when we calculate the welfare losses for an elasticity of -0.5, we present the consumer surplus loss and financial loss (or would induce households to invest in more energy efficient electrical appliances and better insulation in their homes in the long run. After such adjustments households would be able the same level of comfort using less energy. additional expenditures) separately. As Table 4 shows, the consumer surplus loss outweighs the financial loss incurred as a result of higher electricity tariffs. The burden of higher electricity tariffs on household expenditures is lower when households reduce their consumption of electricity. Previous studies have estimated price elasticity of demand for heating to fall somewhere between -0.2 and -0.4, with poorer households being in the more inelastic range of these estimates. 12 Therefore our calculations of welfare losses for zero and -0.5 elasticity assumptions fall within the range of reasonable elasticity estimates. 1.4 Notes: 1 Welfare losses expressed as a percent of household expenditures and calculated assuming electricity price increase to 7 c\u20ac/kWh using the 2004 ISSP Montenegro Household Survey.",

Electricity subsidies can be financed through a direct transfer of government funds or through a cross-subsidy between different groups of consumers. In this paper we refer to both types of transfer, whether from the government or from other consumers, as a subsidy. It is common to provide subsidies directly through the energy system by designing an Increasing Block Tariff (IBT), also called the \"lifeline tariff,\" or through a Volume Differentiated Tariff (VDT). 13 Another approach is to provide means-tested income transfers to qualifying households through a general social assistance program. \"Social tariffs\" combine the elements of these two approaches (see Table 5 ). For example, an IBT or other types of electricity discounts could be provided only to the qualifying customers, identified by administrative selection. A lower price is charged per kWh up to a pre-determined consumption threshold (lifeline limit). Consumption above the threshold limit is charged a higher price per kWh. All households consuming electricity benefit from the lower tariff below the threshold.",

A systematic review of electricity consumption subsidies in 22 countries reached a conclusion that an IBT, the most common tariff approach to providing subsidies, tends to have high coverage of the poor 14 According to EPCG, if old debts are excluded, the collection ratio varied between 62.4 and 89.4 percent between 1999 and 2004, and in 2004 it varied between 69 and 100 percent by region. It is important to evaluate the relationship between tariff increases and arrears to see if high tariffs lead to deterioration in the payment discipline. Such data are not available in the survey data we use in this paper, so we are not able to investigate this relationship. 15 For an in-depth discussion of the ways to design a successful means-tested direct income transfers program see Coady, Grosh and Hoddinot (2004) . Targeting Transfers in Developing Countries. Review of Lessons and Experience. The World Bank. Washington, D.C. but be poorly targeted. Modifying the block structure of an IBT can result in small improvements in terms of better targeting of the subsidy to the poor households. Introducing a VDT or well-targeted income transfers through the social protection system rather than the electricity sector can result in significant improvements. 16 While it is usually true that an IBT does not result in well-targeted subsidies, in Montenegro electricity consumption is highly correlated with income. Households in the top decile of total per capita expenditures consume almost three times as much electricity as households in the bottom decile (Appendix Table 2 ). Although per capita consumption of electricity is almost constant with respect to income, the average household size is almost twice as large in the top as in the bottom decile. Figure 3 clearly shows the strong correlation between total household electricity consumption and household size. As a consequence of this strong correlation, an IBT or a VDT will be better targeted in Montenegro than in most other countries.",

Second, we estimate the total annual subsidy received by each household as the average level of electricity consumption multiplied by the subsidy per unit. Third, we calculate the total subsidy received by the poor and non-poor households. Last, we compare the coverage and targeting 16 Komives et. al.

The future cost-recovery tariff in these simulations is assumed to equal 7 c\u20ac/kWh. 2 In Scenarios 1 and 2 we calculated from the household survey data that this is the amount that would need to be financed either by the government or the energy company in scenarios where it is not covered by a cross-subsidy from high volume to low volume consumers.",

Clearly, all households are subsidy recipients in Scenario 1 when everybody is charged a tariff below the cost-recovery level (Table 7) . In Scenario 2 the price of the first block is below the cost-recovery level, and at the cost-recovery level for the second block. In this case all consumers are subsidy beneficiaries. In Scenario 3 all consumers receive a subsidy for the first 300 kWh; however, high volume consumers pay a higher price than the cost-recovery level for consumption in excess of 300 kWh. Since non-poor households are high volume consumers, our calculations show that overall they would be cross-subsidizing the poor. This result is unique to the countries like Montenegro, where higher income households consume significantly more electricity than low income households, making it relatively easy to implement quantity-based targeting with an IBT structure. 19 However, it is necessary to have a very large difference between the price for consumption below and above the threshold, and it may not necessarily be politically feasible.",

However, this tariff scheme would perform worse in terms of coverage. As shown in Table 7 , only two thirds of the poorest households would receive any subsidy. The remaining 26 percent of households in the bottom decile consume more than 500 kWh and they would pay for their consumption at the higher rate, assuming that they do not adjust their consumption level in response to the change in tariff policy. Targeted transfers in Scenario 5, which assumes that current FMS recipients qualify for an increased transfer to offset higher electricity tariffs, would reach a low share of the poor. The Government of Montenegro would need to develop a well-targeted and broad-based program of social assistance if benefit provision through direct income transfers were to be the chosen mitigation option. However, this would be an expensive program and the Government does not currently planning to re-design the social protection system in order to broaden the recipient base and improve benefit targeting. Limitations of benefit incidence analysis. In this section we have conducted a static analysis, assuming that households do not adjust their consumption of electricity to the price increase. In reality, some households will adjust by reducing their electricity consumption and switching away from electricity to fuelwood. To the extent that the poor switch at a higher rate than the non-poor, the distribution of the beneficiaries of a subsidy can change in the policy scenarios examined. This is especially true for the VDT scenario. The poorest households whose consumption is close to the 500 kWh threshold are likely to reduce their consumption below the limit so that they would qualify for the lower tariff, especially if some mechanism is in place to prevent them from accidentally exceeding the limit and switching to the higher tariff.",

However, it is also important to recognize the limitations of this approach. The distribution of a subsidy does not imply anything about the distribution of the welfare impact of different programs. For example, poor households with low consumption of electricity may have a higher valuation of each additional unit of consumption and it may be more difficult for them to substitute away from electricity than it is for households with a high consumption volume. By the same token, households with no access to substitute fuels or facing technical constraints in switching fuels would also incur higher welfare losses from an electricity tariff increase than households with easy access to substitute fuels. Furthermore, switching to fuelwood gives rise to externalities from an increased rate of deforestation. Benefit incidence analysis is not intended to address any of these issues. This type of analysis is useful for comparing the distribution of the subsidy via different mechanisms, but not to determine the socially optimal level of a subsidy.",

Although the price of electricity does not vary across households, the price of fuelwood varies considerably across the country. Since the price of electricity does not vary, we cannot directly estimate its impact on heating fuel choice. We therefore examine the impact of the price of fuelwood relative to the price electricity. 23 Household per capita expenditures are used instead of income, due to a large number of missing observations on reported income. The importance of income/expenditures in household fuel choice is well documented. 24 As income rises, household consumption of biomass fuels decreases and the uptake of modern fuels increases. However, one may be concerned that the inclusion of income and household characteristics which may partly determine 20 Lampietti, Julian, Anthony Kolb, Sumila Gulyani, and Vahram Avenesyan (2001) . Utility Pricing and the Poor: Lessons from Armenia. World Bank Technical Paper No. 497. 21 The model used here follows Rasmus Heltberg's analysis in Fuel Switching: Evidence from Eight Developing Countries. Energy Economics (2004). 22 During the winter, households use fuelwood for heating as well as for cooking. This is simply because they typically have only one cooker in the house, mainly in the living and dining rooms (very often, those two rooms are connected). 23 We define the relative price as the ratio of the price of fuel wood to the price of electricity. The price of fuel wood is converted into kWh units, using the standard energy conversion factor of 2,610 kWh in one cubic meter of fuel wood. This assumes moisture content is one third of weight. The efficiency of using fuel wood is clearly determined by the type of wood stove used and the effective energy content of one cubic meter of fuel wood will be different for households using different types of wood stoves. 24 See Barnes, D.F., Krutilla, K., Hyde, W. 2004 income levels may lead to bias estimates. We therefore compare the results of the model estimated with and without the household per capita expenditures variable. We find that the inclusion of household per capita expenditures does not significantly affect any of the other explanatory variables coefficients, and report the results including per capita expenditures as one of the explanatory variables (as do most other energy studies).",

Larger household are also more likely to use fuelwood than smaller households. Ownership of a wood plot also significantly increases the probability of using fuelwood for space heating. Thus household characteristics matter a great deal in the choice of heating fuel. Larger household size, which could indicate the availability of free household labor to chop and transport fuelwood, and ownership of a wood plot, may make fuelwood an even cheaper alternative heating fuel. Female headed households and households headed by a less educated individual are more likely to use fuelwood, even when household income is controlled for.

Our main interest here is to predict the number of household that may switch to fuelwood as a result of electricity price increases.

Table 9 shows the predicted changes in the proportion of households using electricity only, fuelwood only, or using both electricity and fuelwood., assuming an increase in electricity prices to 7c\u20ac/kWh.
