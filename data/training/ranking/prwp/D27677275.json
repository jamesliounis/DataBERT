        "text": "Health insurance is thought to be an important determinant of healthcare utilization and health outcomes, particularly among children (Olson et al. 2005; Kaiser Family Foundation 2002) . Studies have shown that children's health insurance is positively correlated with immunization rates, checkups, and overall health care utilization; insured children may also have improved health outcomes and lower mortality (Abdullah et al. 2009 ; Currie and Gruber 1996; Newacheck et al. 1996; Newacheck et al. 1998; Palmer et al. 2015; Todd et al. 2006) . However, causally attributing these observed differences in outcomes to health insurance coverage is difficult due to adverse selection: parents may choose to enroll in coverage if they have children who are likely to be sick (Polimeni and Levine 2011 ). On the other hand, parents with more resources or education may be more likely have health insurance coverage for their children, resulting in advantageous selection (Fang et al. 2008) . Studies examining the effects of health insurance coverage on outcomes are complicated by potential biases due to selection into enrollment. This paper overcomes the usual empirical challenges to measure the causal effects of health insurance using an experiment that randomly assigned parents in Managua, Nicaragua access to free health insurance. We study the effects of insurance among children (ages 15 and under) . Although recent studies on health insurance also utilize random or quasi-random research designs, these either occur in the United States or estimate impacts only among adults (Banerjee et al. 2014; Barofsky 2015; Finkelstein et al. 2012; King et al. 2009; Levine et al. 2011; Newhouse 1993; Sheth 2014) . The results from these existing studies may not apply to children or to the developing country context because the elasticity of health care demand has been found to be larger in the developing country setting and larger for children as compared to adults (Zhou et al. 2011; Gertler and van der Gaag 1990; Sauerborn et al. 1994 ).",

        "text": "In addition to analyzing effects among insured children, we also examine how having an insured parent affects healthcare utilization among children who are ineligible for the insurance themselves. This allows us to see how families adjust their health demands in response to parental insurance coverage. A model of healthcare demand within a household predicts that parents efficiently optimize, equating the ratio of marginal benefits to costs across all family members, rather than separately for each individual member (Jacobson 2000) . If one member becomes insured, the net effect upon uninsured members' utilization is ambiguous if parents reallocate time or financial resources across household members in response to the decreased cost of utilization. The net outcome may be either towards or away from uninsured children, depending upon whether the income or substitution effect dominates. Alternatively, following health insurance enrollment of some members, parents could reallocate resources to increase utilization for uncovered members to ensure equity across their children (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham 2014; Ejrnaes and Portner 2004; Griliches 1979; Hertwig et al. 2002) . The empirical literature measuring the effects of parental health insurance enrollment thus far has generated mixed results and none are based upon randomized studies. 1 To study the effects of insurance on insured and uninsured children, we utilize an age-eligibility cut-off rule that gave coverage only to children under the age of 12.",

A related literature examines how parental insurance eligibility affects health insurance enrollment of eligible children, finding positive spillovers on children's enrollment into Medicaid in the United States (Dubay and Kenney 2003; Sommers 2006; Aizer and Grogger 2003; Busch and Duchovny 2005) .

It is possible that health insurance actually made eligible children with insured parents sick more often despite their increased utilization at providers, through iatrogenic illnesses from waiting rooms, for example (Steel et al. 2004) .

Individuals without valid income data were imputed to be the median and regressions were run with a dummy variable indicating the missing value. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the family level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Source: Authors' analysis based on data described in paper. Sample in odd columns is all parents with at least one child age 15 and under at baseline; sample in even columns is all children under aged 15 years and under at baseline. Above are coefficients from OLS regressions of whether or not the child's parent enrolled in health insurance on baseline variables. Children are 'Eligible' if they are age 11 or under; children age 12 and over are 'Ineligible' for health insurance and therefore not enrolled. All regressions include market and round fixed effects. Missing income values are imputed to the mean, and an indicator variable is included in the regression.
