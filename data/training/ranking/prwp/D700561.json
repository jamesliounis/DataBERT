The paper illustrates that a rapid reconnaissance survey of water vending activities and the willingness of households to pay for improved water services can yield valuable inforn tion for water supply planning and unexpected policy insights.",

Not only are they concerned about the equity (and political) consequences of raising water prices, but also they fear that people cannot or will not pay higher prices and will not connect to (or will disconnect from) the piped distribution system if prices are raised. If a significant number of households disconnect from the piped distribution system or reduce consumption, as a result of a price increase, total revenues could decline.

Operating costs such as labor, gasoline and oil, water (purchased from private boreholes), and maintenance are about 80 percent of the total monthly costs; the capital costs of the truck account for the remaining 20 percent. As illustrated in Table Al , the capital costs have been calculated using three different capital recovery factors (0.12, 0.16, and 0.20) .

For all four sizes of tanker trucks, monthly profits are much larger in the dry season than in the rainy season. The 1000-gallon and 1500-gallon tanker trucks essentially just cover their costs during the rainy season, but in the dry season all sizes of trucks are able to make large profits. As a percent of total capital at risk (i.e., the market value of the tanker truck), the annual profits of tanker truck owners range from 45 percent to 87 percent, depending on the size of the truck and the capital recovery factor assumed.",

Jn order to keep track of the sales of their drivers, the owners have developed an elaborate record-keeping system which involves posting two union employees at each borehole to record the amount of water purchased by each tanker truck driver. This information enables the owners to determine whether drivers are reporting all of their sales and thus presumably prevents tanker truck drivers from selling water on the side and pocketing the cash (no information is available on the costs of this record-keeping or other union activities, and no such costs have been included in the estimates of the profitability of tanker truck ownership). An owners' association which can arrange such extensive cooperation among its members may well have the ability to prevent the entry of new tanker trucks into the industry and thus to maintain prices above free market levels. Such market control could account for the high profits currently being achieved by owners of tanker trucks.",

Over the last few years anyone contemplating the purchase of a tanker truck would have known that the World Bank-financed New Onitsha Water Scheme promised to greatly increase the quantity of water in the existing distribution network. This knowledge should have created significant uncertainty about the future profitability of tanker truck vending. As it turned out, however, the opening of the new system was repeatedly delayed, and, even when it opened, the existing distribution network was so inadequate that much of the business of the tanker trucks was not seriously threatened. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the water supply situation in Onitsha may have resulted in a smaller number of tanker trucks than would otherwise have existed, and this restricted capacity may have enabled the individuals already in the business to exert some market control and charge higher prices.",
