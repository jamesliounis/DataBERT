In his view, the early compilations assembled by the International Labor Organization and the World Bank referred to different population concepts, different income concepts, and different parts of the national economy. To underline his doubts, Kuznets once asked (rhetorically) at a University of Wisconsin seminar \"Do you really think you can get good conclusions from bad data?\" Economists with interest in inequality are indebted to Kuznets for his sage warning. 1 We are even more indebted to Kuznets for violating his own warning when, earlier in his career, he famously conjectured about his Kuznets Curve based on a handful of very doubtful inequality observations. His 1954 Detroit AEA Presidential Address mused on how inequality might have risen and fallen over two centuries, and theorized about the sectoral and demographic shifts that might have caused such movements. Over the last half century, economists have responded enthusiastically to his postulated Kuznets Curve, searching for better data, better tests, and better models.",

For these three advanced countries, incomes had become more unequal between the late nineteenth century and the 1950s. He presented no data at all regarding earlier trends, yet bravely conjectured that \"income inequality might have been widening from about 1780 to 1850 in England; from about 1840 to 1890, and particularly from 1870 on in the United States;",

None of our ancient inequality observations would rate a \"1\" on the Deininger-Squire scale. Yet, like Gregory King in the 1690s and Simon Kuznets in the 1950s, we must start somewhere. Section 2 begins by introducing some new concepts that we use for the analysis --the inequality possibility frontier and the inequality extraction ratio, measures of the extent to which the elite extract the maximum feasible inequality. These new measures open the door to fresh interpretations of inequality in the very long run. The next section presents our ancient inequality evidence. Section 4 examines income gaps between top and bottom, and the extent to which observed inequality change over the very long run is driven by those gaps as opposed to the distribution of income among those at the top or the top's income share. Section 5 explores how the stylized facts are changed when conventional annual income measures are replaced by lifetime income measures. We conclude with a research agenda.",

The remainder of the total income is the surplus that is shared among the richer classes. When average incomes are very low, and barely above the subsistence minimum, the surplus is small. Under those primitive conditions, the members of the upper class will be few, and the level of inequality will be quite modest.",

The Gini coefficient corresponding to such a distribution will be only 4.7 percent. If total income improves over time to 2000 units, then the sole upper class member will be able to extract 1010 units, and the corresponding Gini coefficient will leap to 49.5 percent. If we chart the locus of such maximum possible Ginis on the vertical axis against mean income levels on the horizontal axis, we obtain the inequality possibility frontier (IPF). 2 Note also that by virtue of the fact that any progressive transfer must reduce inequality measured by the Gini coefficient, we know that a less socially-segmented society must result in a lower Gini. 3 Thus, IPF is indeed a frontier.",

        "text": "Income distribution data based on household surveys are, of course, unavailable for pre-industrial societies. The earliest household surveys of income and expenditures date from the late eighteenth century in England and the mid nineteenth century in other countries. We believe that the best estimates of ancient inequalities can be obtained from what are called social tables (or, as William Petty (1676) called it more than three centuries ago, political arithmetick) where various social classes are ranked from the richest to the poorest with their estimated population (family or household head) shares and average incomes. Social tables are particularly useful in evaluating ancient societies where classes were clearly delineated and the differences in mean incomes between them were substantial. Theoretically, if class alone determined one's income, and if differences in income within classes were small, then all inequality would be explained by the between-class inequality. One of the best examples of social tables is offered by Gregory King's famous estimates for England and Wales in 1688 (Barnett 1936; Lindert and Williamson 1982 ). King's list of classes summarized in Table 1 is fairly detailed (31 social classes). King (and others listed in Table 1 ) did not report inequalities within each social class so we cannot identify within-class inequality for 1688 England and Wales or for any other of the Table 1 observations. However, within-class inequalities can be roughly gauged by calculating two Gini values: a lower bound Gini1 which estimates only the between-group inequality and assumes within-group or within-social class inequality to be zero; an upper bound Gini2 which estimates the maximum inequality that is compatible with the grouped data from social tables assuming that all individuals from a higher social group are richer than any individual from a lower social group. In other words, where class mean incomes are such that y j >y i , it also holds true that y kj >y mi for all members of group j, where k and m are subscripts that denote individuals. Thus, in addition to the between-class inequality component, Gini2 includes some within-class inequality (see equation 2), but under the strong assumption that mean incomes for all members of a given social class are poorer or richer than those respectively above or below them. This strong assumption is unlikely to be fulfilled in any actual social table, but it allows us to move beyond an accounting limited only to between-class inequality. 9",

The fourth possibility is unlikely: since our estimates of inequality are based only on a few classes, they are likely to be biased downwards, not upwards. The last possibility offers the more likely explanation. It could well be that the subsistence minimum was less than $PPP 400 for some societies. 15 In particular, this is likely to be the case for subtropical or tropical regions where calorie, by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) , who, in calculation of multidimensional inequality (income times life expectancy), use a calibration to transform these two variables into one.",

Consequently, if recorded inequality is stable, the inequality extraction ratio must fall; and even if recorded inequality goes up, the ratio may not. This can be seen in Figure 4 where we plot the inequality extraction ratio against GDI per capita. Thus, the social consequences of increased inequality may not entail as much relative impoverishment, or as much perceived injustice, as might appear if we looked only at the recorded Gini. This logic is particularly compelling for poor and middle-income countries where increases in income push the maximum feasible inequality up relatively sharply, since the IPF curve is concave. The farther a society rises above the subsistence minimum, the less will economic development lift its inequality possibility frontier, and thus the inequality extraction ratio will be driven more and more by the rise in the Gini itself. This is best illustrated by the United States where the maximum feasible inequality already stands at [ Figure 4 around here]",

        "text": "We conclude by stressing three key aspects of inequality that ancient preindustrial experience has uncovered. First, as measured by the Gini coefficient, income inequality in still-pre-industrial countries today is not very different from inequality in distant pre-industrial times. In addition, the variance between countries then and now is much greater than the variance in average inequality between then and now. Second, the extraction ratio -how much of potential inequality was converted into actual inequalitywas significantly bigger then than now. We are persuaded that much more can be learned about inequality in the past and the present by looking at the extraction ratio rather than just at actual inequality. The ratio shows how powerful and extortionary are the elite, its institutions, and its policies. For example, in a regression using ancient inequality evidence (not included in the text) a dummy variable for colony has a strong positive impact on the extraction ratio. Furthermore, while a relation between conflict and actual inequality has proven hard to document on modern evidence (see Collier and Hoeffler, 2004) , we conjecture that the introduction of the inequality possibility frontier and the extraction ratio might shed brighter light on that hypothesis. Third, differences in lifetime survival rates between rich and poor countries and between rich and poor individuals within countries were much higher two centuries ago than they are now, and this served to make for greater lifetime inequality in the past. Fourth, unlike the findings regarding the evolution of the 20 th century inequality in advanced economies, our ancient inequality sample does not reveal any significant correlation between the income share of the top 1 percent and overall inequality. Thus, an equally high Gini could and was achieved in two ways: in some societies, a high income share of the elite coexisted with a yawning gap between it and the rest of society, and small differences in income amongst the non-elite; in other societies, the very top of income pyramid was followed by only slightly less rich people and then further down toward something that resembled a middle class. Why were some ancient societies more hierarchal while others were more socially diverse? While this paper has focused on inequality description in ancient societies, it has not explored the social structure underpinning inequality or its determinants.",

Yet, despite these incomes being extravagantly high, this is only a part of the story since Gini without the British is still at a rather high level of 45 (as opposed to 48-49 with them).

        "text": "Income Class Note: Average household size (5.25) assumed to be the same across all income groups Income distribution data. The source is Malanima (2006: p. 31) , who uses the tax census data from 1811. This tax census is, for the purposes of establishing an estimate of income distribution, better than others because it surveyed not only tax paying units but also the poor (the indigent). Each of the 14 provinces of the Kingdom was supposed to place people in predetermined nine categories, running from the poorest to the richest (by family income). The percentage of people placed in each category was \"free\" (that is, left to each village, city etc.) with the only stipulation that not more than one-sixth of the population may be placed in the bottom category (the \"indigent\") and hence be exempt from taxation. The problem is that it imposes an equality of conditions across provinces and leads to an underestimation of incomes in the rich areas like Naples-city. For example, people with a same income may be placed in category III in Naples and in higher category IV in a poorer province. Similarly, the number of poor in Naples (which was probably high) might have been underestimated (because of the imposed threshold of one-sixth). Yet, with the exception of the Naples-city (then the third largest European city containing about 6 percent of the total Kingdom's population), which also displayed relatively high inequality, 27 income differences between the provinces were too small to lead to significant and systematic misplacing of households. The ratio of mean rural incomes between the richest and poorest province was less than 1.5 to 1 (and rural population accounted for 85% of the total population). 28 Another problem is that the authorities in each province might have been tempted to underestimate people's incomes and to push more people into lower classes so that taxes would be minimized. This is reflected in the fact that some 75 percent of families were grouped in the second class (just above the indigent; see Malanima 2006 , Table 3 , p. 9). 29 Malanima, however, revises these original data, uses information about salaries and other sources of income, and constructs a new distribution (which we use here) composed of nine groups, each consisting of 10 percent of the population, and the top decile divided into three groups (see Malanima 2006: Appendix) . We thus obtain an income distribution composed of twelve groups ranked by their estimated per capita income.",

Taking relative shares of urban and rural populations (85 and 15 percent), we estimate the subsistence minimum at 35 ducats per person annually. Mean income is thus 1.9 times the subsistence. Taking $PPP 400 for the subsistence, results in mean income of $PPP 752. This can be contrasted with Maddison's (2004) Income distribution data.

Goldsmith provides minimum wealth (census qualification) for the three top classes (senators, knights and municipal senators) and an estimate of their mean incomes. The problem was that -taking these estimates as given, and assuming that the bulk of the working population lived at slightly above the subsistence minimum ($PPP 400)-one finds an overall lower mean income than given by Goldsmith and used here (HS 380) . This is why we introduced, following Goldsmith who spoke of that class but did not put any numbers on it, a fourth rich class of \"other rich people\" who were neither Roman knights nor municipal senators (both of which needed to fulfill the census requirements). There is no doubt that that \"fourth\" rich class existed but putting a number on its size and average income is obviously difficult. We decided to take as their mean income the average of the two other higher classes' incomes (leaving out as decidedly the richest the class of Roman senators).",

The estimated Gini of between 37 and 40 might seem low in the light of the excesses of wealth in Rome (see Table below with data gathered from Tacitus's Annals) But this extraordinary wealth was limited to a very few people at the very top. It is very unlikely that they would be even selected (so few they were) to participate in a modern random household survey. Moreover, their extraordinary wealth was not out of step with what we observe today. For example, the fabulously rich triumvir Marcus Crassus (-115 to -53) whose wealth was estimated at 200 million HS (Schiavone, 2000, p.71) and hence his income at HS 12 million per year, 31 has more than a counterpart in today's Bill Gates and other super rich. Crassus's income was equal to about 32,000 mean Roman incomes. Using today's US GDI per capita, the equivalent would be an income of about $1 billion per year. But this is an income that is easily made by many of today's hyper-billionaires and yet the overall inequality is not much affected by it. Bill Gates's fortune is estimated at $50 billion which with 5% interest yields $2.5 billion per year, i.e., more than twice as much as Crassus-expressed in mean incomes of one's own time and place. According to The Forbes' Magazine 2007 list of richest people in the world, 32 four individuals in the United States have wealth above $20 billion which would place them around Crassus's level.",

For the urbanization rate, we use a median estimate of 10 percent. Discussion. Temin (2003) argues that Goldsmith's calculation of the mean Roman income is too high. However, there are at least three counterarguments to Temin: (1) his critique of Goldsmith's calculations is not based on Goldsmith's methodology (which Temin praises) but on Goldsmith's apparent use of Rome-based wage rates for the rest of the Empire including Egypt where both wheat prices and wages were much lower in nominal terms. Temin then uses an average of the two nominal wage-rates, and obtains a significantly lower overall Imperial mean income. But that issue can be sidestepped by arguing that the Imperial numbers are expressed in Rome-city prices. This is acceptable since Temin (2003, p. 19) himself believes that real (wheat) wages in Egypt and Romecity were about the same. Thus, Temin's metrhodology of averaging two nominal wagerates seems faulty. (2) The level of infrastructural development, urbanization, size of a large standing army (almost \u00bd of a percent of total population), and the point made by Schiavone (2000) that regional differences in mean incomes might have been as high as 5 or even 6 to 1, 33 imply that an overall Imperial mean income was unlikely to have been less than HS 380 (as calculated by Goldsmith) which, using the assumptions regarding the subsistence minimum, translates into about $PPP 850 (in 1990 prices). (3) There is the consistency argument against changing Goldsmith's mean income while retaining his other calculations. Now, let us define G(y) = total income of those with incomes above y divided by total population; if it follows a Pareto distribution, then For example, if the Pareto constant is 2, then mean income of those with income greater than y, will be 2y.",

In other words, we have percentages of people with an average income and do not know lower or upper bounds of their income ranges. Notice that the same problem exists when the data are arranged in deciles and only mean income by decile is available. Second, there are very likely \"leakages\"--namely people from lower (mean-poorer) social groups whose actual incomes are higher and should be part of the top (and the reverse).

These studies find that most of the action takes place at the top of the income distribution pyramid and that differences in the top 1 percent income share account for much of the differences in overall inequality. These top share studies have also been performed on poor pre-modern India (since 1922: Banerjee and Piketty 2005), Indonesia (since 1920: Leigh and van der Eng 2006) and Japan (since 1885: Moriguchi and Saez 2005), but it is important to stress that they do not find this result, but rather assume it. So, are differences in the share of the top 1 percent also a good proxy for differences in overall income distribution in ancient pre-industrial societies? The share of top 1 percent is estimated here under the assumption that top incomes follow a Pareto distribution. Our approach is basically the same as that recently used by Atkinson (forthcoming) and by others writing before him (see the references in Atkinson). The estimation procedure is explained in detail in Appendix 3 where several caveats are listed since our social tables are different from the usual income distribution data sources.",

This would seem to indicate the absence of a middle class, that is, of those who would normally fill in the \"space\" between the mean income and (say) an income 3 to 4 times greater than the mean. The results for China display the same pattern. 17 On the other hand, the top percentile was very rich in the Roman Empire (16.1 percent of total income), but the cutoff point was very high too: 12.4 times the mean. This suggests a Roman income distribution with a long tail of rich people such that the 2 nd -5 th percentiles were also quite rich.

Three forces are likely to explain most of the variance in an augmented ancient inequality sample. First, initial resource endowments should matter, especially for ancient agricultural settlements. Different endowments imply different food crops, and different food crops imply different technologies. Some agrarian technologies imply constant returns (rice) and some increasing returns (wheat). The difference may matter for the inequality configuration of ancient inequalities. Second, whether the country is the colonizer or the colonized should matter. Throughout history, colonial powers have ruled by rewarding indigenous elites, not by mollifying the masses. Third, a mixture of political and market forces must have been at work, especially the former. More political power and patronage implies more inequality. The frequent claim that inequality promotes accumulation and growth does not get much support from history. On the contrary, great economic inequality has always been correlated with extreme concentration of political power, and that power has always been used to widen the income gaps through rent-seeking and rent-keeping, forces that demonstrably retard economic growth. 23 Development Centre.

For comparative purposes, we also show the English 1801-3 data where the top 1 percent share, as well as the steepness of the line after the top percentile, are similar to those of Rome. It seems that the main difference among the very rich in Rome 14 and England 1801-3 was that the people just below the very top of the income pyramid were, relative to the mean, somewhat less rich in England than in Rome. Finally, notice that in all three cases, the top 5 percent of income recipients received between 30 and just over 40 percent of total income. In contrast, the top 5 percent received about a quarter of total income in modern United States and United Kingdom, while the share is 27 percent in modern Chile and a third in Brazil.",

        "text": "The source is the Lindert-Williamson revision of Gregory King's social table (available at http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/fzlinder/King1688revised.htm). The data which were originally presented on per household basis are transformed on per capita basis (each individual is assigned per capita income of his/her household).Bairoch (1985: Table 13/1, p. 279)  gives the year 1700 range (based on cities greater than 5,000) to be to 16 percent. For 1688, we have used the lower bound of the range (13 percent). Obtained by interpolation fromMaddison's (2001, p. 247)   estimates of English and Welsh GDI per capita in 1600 and 1700. An alternative calculation based directly on King's estimates yield almost the same result. If we take the ratio between the mean income from King's social table (9.6 pounds per capita per annum) and the subsistence minimum assumed to be one-third above the vagrants' income (2.7 pounds), we get a mean income which is 3.5 times the subsistence which, combined with the subsistence minimum of $PPP 400, yields an average income of $PPP 1400. The interpolation based on Maddison's data is $PPP 1418.Income distribution data. Based onColquhoun 1801-3 social table revised by Lindert andWilliamson.
