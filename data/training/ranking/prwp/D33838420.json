        "text": "To understand the role of family background in intergenerational mobility, a large literature has focused on the conditional mean of children's economic outcomes given parent's economic status, while ignoring the information contained in conditional variance. This paper explores the effects of family background on the conditional variance of children's outcomes in the context of intergenerational educational mobility using data from three large developing countries (China, India, and Indonesia). The empirical analysis uses exceptionally rich data free of sample truncation because of the nonresident children at the time of the survey. Evidence from all three countries suggests a strong influence of father's education on the conditional variance of children's schooling. The analysis finds substantial heterogeneity across countries, gender, and geography (rural/ urban). Cohort-based estimates suggest that the effects of father's education on the conditional variance have changed qualitatively; in some cases, a positive effect in the 1950s cohort turns into a substantial negative effect in the 1980s cohort. A methodology is developed to incorporate the effects of family background on the conditional variance along with the standard conditional mean effects. This paper derives risk-adjusted measures of relative and absolute mobility by accounting for an estimate of the risk premium for the conditional variance faced by a child. The estimates of risk-adjusted relative and absolute mobility for China, India, and Indonesia suggest that the existing evidence using the standard measures of mobility substantially underestimates the effects of family background on children's educational opportunities, and thus gives a false impression of high educational mobility. The magnitude of underestimation is especially large for the children born into the most disadvantaged households where fathers have no schooling, while it is negligible for the children of college educated fathers. The standard (but partial) measures may lead to an incorrect ranking of regions and groups in terms of relative mobility. Compared to the risk-adjusted measures, the standard measures are likely to underestimate the gender gap and rural-urban gap in educational opportunities.",

        "text": "(1) Introduction A large economic and sociological literature provides estimates of intergenerational persistence in economic status. A higher persistence across generations is interpreted as inequality of economic opportunities for children as their life chances are tied down closely to the socioeconomic status of their parents irrespective of their own choices and eort. The bulk of the measures used for understanding the transmission of economic status from one generation to the next are based on a conditional expectation function. The focus is on estimating the expected value of an indicator of socioeconomic status of children (e.g., permanent income, education ) conditional on parent's (usually father's) socioeconomic status (for surveys, see Solon (1999) , Bjorklund and Salvanes (2011) , Iversen et al.

        "text": "2 This is a reasonable approach under two conditions: (i) the conditional variance of the relevant economic outcome does not vary in any systematic way with parental economic status, geographic location, gender, race and ethnicity etc.; (ii) parents and children are approximately risk neutral. A large body of evidence accumulated over many decades rejects risk neutrality, and strongly suggests an important role for risk aversion in economic choices under uncertainty (see, for example, Eeckhoudt et al. (2005) ). There is no systematic evidence in the literature on the rst condition, but there are a variety of economic mechanisms that can make the conditional variance a function of parent's economic status and geographic location, for example. Conditional variance in children's schooling may vary across the households in a village because of their dierent abilities to cope with adverse weather shocks. With better access to credit and insurance markets, the highly educated (high income) households are better able to deal with negative shocks such as ood and drought without any disruption to children's education. In contrast, such a negative income shock may force the uneducated poor parents to take the children out of school and 2 Although largely ignored in the literature on intergenerational mobility, some studies in the related but distinct literature on inequality of opportunity (IOP) account for the fact that conditional variance is likely to depend on the circumstances a child is born into (see, for example, Bjorklund et al. (2012) ). But their focus is very dierent. Please see the discussion in section 2 below. There is a small literature that exploits the information in conditional variance by estimating quantile regression models of intergenerational mobility.",

This adds an element of uncertainty (on top of ability dierences) for the children born into disadvantaged households, resulting in a higher conditional variance in completed schooling. The conditional variance of children's schooling attainment is likely to decline with the education of parents when such economic shocks (income or health shocks) are the primary sources behind the observed variance in the data. In this case, children born to higher educated parents not only have higher expected years of schooling (as found in numerous studies of intergenerational educational mobility), but also a lower variance in schooling attainment. Under the plausible assumption of risk aversion, this implies being born to higher educated parents brings double advantages for children part of which is ignored by the existing measures of intergenerational mobility.",

The estimates of both RIGRC and IGRC for decade wise birth cohorts show that the evolution of intergenerational educational mobility has been very dierent in China compared to India and Indonesia. China has become less mobile from the 1950s to the 1980s while mobility has improved monotonically from the 1950s to the 1980s in India and Indonesia, and the magnitude is substantial. While both measures pick the trend correctly, the standard IGRC substantially underestimates the improvements over time in India.",

The next section discusses the relevant conceptual issues with a focus on the economic mechanisms that can give rise to a negative or positive eect of father's education on the conditional variance of children's schooling, and lays out the estimating equations. Section (3) is devoted to a discussion of the surveys and data sets used for our analysis: CFPS 2014 (China), IHDS 2012 (India), and IFLS 2014 for Indonesia. These three surveys are dierent from many other household surveys available in developing countries as the samples do not suer from signicant truncation. This is important as truncation of a sample is expected to reduce the estimate variance. Section (4) reports the evidence on the conditional variance. In section (5), we develop a methodology for estimating relative mobility that takes into account both the conditional mean and conditional variance, and provide estimates of the risk adjusted relative mobility measure. The paper concludes with summary of the ndings and points out the central contributions of the paper to the literature.",

We thus expect lower average level of education for the children of less educated parents, but the conditional variance should not depend in any signicant way on father's education in this case. The second model of credit market imperfections focuses on the quantitative credit rationing, a special case of which is self nancing by the parents (the case of missing credit market for investment in education). When the parents have limited investment funds, they might choose to invest in the most able child to maximize the expected income (?).

However, as emphasized by Behrman et al.

For example, strong son preference and Purdah may imply that girls in poor households go to school only if schooling is easily accessible and, more importantly, free. They drop out after primary schooling because secondary and higher schooling requires substantial private investments by the parents and the high schools may be far away. We might thus observe low conditional variance in the households with less educated parents because of bunching around primary schooling or other thresholds determined by social norms, particularly for daughters. The richer and more educated households may invest substantially in daughter's education even with son preference, and their investment would be more closely aligned with the ability of a child irrespective of gender.

However, the impacts on the conditional variance shows a much stronger role of the family background in the recent decades which counteracts the improvements in the mean eects. In all three countries, the inuence of father's education on the conditional variance is negative and substantial in magnitude in the 1980s, suggesting that the children born to educated parents gain in terms of a much lower conditional variance, in additional to a higher conditional mean. There are dramatic dierences in the earlier cohorts across countries: the estimate is negative in China, positive in Indonesia, and a zero eect in India for the 1950s 16 The standard mean eects (see the IGRC estimates in the odd numbered columns of Table 3) show that the inuence of father's education is much higher for daughters in terms of the rst moment (expected years of schooling) in China.

As noted earlier, recent evidence suggests that the mobility CEF is likely to be concave or convex in many cases. In such cases, relative mobility varies across the distribution without any risk adjustments, and one can nd that the marginal eect of father's education on children's schooling is larger than 1, especially in the lower tail (for concave CEF) or the upper tail (for convex CEF).

Figures 1A (China) , 1B (India), and 1C (Indonesia) present the graphs of the estimated conditional mean and conditional variance functions using the full sample . The graphs show that the ratio of conditional variance to conditional mean is large in the low educated households, and the ratio declines with father's education. This suggests that the risk premium at the lower end of the distribution is substantially higher, and we expect risk adjustments to substantially reduce the estimates of both relative mobility (RIGRC larger than the IGRC) and absolute mobility (RES lower than ES) of the most disadvantaged children.",

A second important conclusion that comes out of the evidence is that, for the children of college educated fathers, the standard estimates are reasonably close to the risk adjusted estimates. For example, the standard IGRC overestimates relative mobility of the children of college educated fathers by 6.2 percent and absolute mobility by 4.1 percent in India, and the corresponding numbers for Indonesia are 5.6 percent and 2.1 percent. The biases in the corresponding estimates for China are larger, but even then, the biases are about half of that found for the subgroup where fathers have no schooling. The evidence thus suggests that the failure to consider the implications of family background for the second moment of data may not be as consequential for the children born into highly educated households.",

The estimates for various samples are reported in Tables A.4-a.8 in the online appendix section OA.2. The evidence suggests strongly that the relations between family background and conditional variance of children's schooling uncovered in Tables 2-4 are not driven by functional form misspecication of the mobility CEF. The next question we address is whether the estimated impact of father's education largely reects the omitted cognitive ability heterogeneity of children. For this analysis, we take advantage of the IFLS-2014 survey in Indonesia which collected data on multiple indicators of cognitive ability of a child (measurement taken in 2014 when the children are adult): raven test scores and two memory tests. We construct an index of cognitive ability in two steps. First, we construct the rst principal component of the dierent measures of cognitive ability. In the second step, we regress the rst principal component on age and age squared of a child to take out the Flynn eect. The residual from this regression is our index of cognitive ability of a child. We control for the ability index and its squared in the regression for conditional variance in equation (2) above. The estimates for the full sample are reported in online appendix Table A.4 (see online appendix section OA.3). The main message that comes out is that the estimated eects of father's education on conditional variance of schooling of children are not driven by omitted ability heterogeneity. Even though ability controls reduce the estimated coecient, the inuence of father's education still remains substantial and statistically signicant at the 1 percent level. The estimates for other subsamples are available from the authors. (5) Combining the Mean and Conditional Variance Eects: New (and More Complete) Measures of Relative and Absolute MobilityThe evidence presented above suggests strongly that it is important to understand the inuence of family background on the conditional variance in addition to the standard mean eects. In this section, we develop an approach that combines the mean and variance eects using standard results from the theory of decisions under uncertainty.Assume a concave payo function (utility function) dened over the possible schooling outcomes of a child i, W (S c i ). Denote the expected schooling as E(S c i ), and i",

A second important feature of the proposed measures is that they yield the standard measures of relative and absolute mobility currently used in the literature under risk neutrality. For example, consider the workhorse measure of relative educational mobility in the current literature called IGRC, estimated as the parameter \u03b2 in equation (1). For the risk neutral case, we have R = 0, and relative mobility is equal to \u03b2 (IGRC). Under risk aversion, the extent of underestimation when we omit the eects of family background on the conditional variance is given by the second term.It also important to appreciate some of the dierences between the standard measures and the risk-adjusted measures proposed here. Even though all the estimates of \u03b2 as a measure of relative mobility we are aware of fall in the open interval (0, 1), the risk adjusted measures may not be contained in this interval. For example, when the ratio of conditional variance to conditional mean is large, the risk premium in equation (9) can be large enough to make RIGRC estimate greater than 1.",

Consistent with the discussion above, the evidence conrms that accounting for risk reveals much worse educational opportunities for the children born to fathers with low or no education. The gap between the RIGRC and IGRC estimates is the largest for the children of fathers with no schooling, and the same is true for the gap between ES (expected years of schooling) and RES (risk adjusted expected years of schooling). For relative mobility, the canonical IGRC estimate underestimates the inuence of family background for this most disadvantaged subgroup of children by 41 percent in China, 63 percent in India, and 28 percent in Indonesia.

The estimates of the risk adjusted relative and absolute mobility for China, India and Indonesia suggest that the current practice of ignoring the conditional variance results in substantial underestimation of the eects of family background on children's educational opportunities. More important, the magnitude of underestimation in the standard measures is the largest for the most disadvantaged children born into households where fathers have no schooling. The existing literature on intergenerational educational mobility thus substantially overestimates the intergenerational educational mobility of disadvantaged children. The standard (but partial) measure may lead to incorrect ranking of countries in terms of relative mobility. The standard measure of relative mobility (IGRC) is likely to underestimate the gender gap and rural-urban gap in educational opportunities.",
