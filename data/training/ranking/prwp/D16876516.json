        "text": "Measuring taxation performance of countries is both theoretically and practically challenging. The actual tax collection-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is generally interpreted as a measure of tax effort and used as the basis for cross country tax comparison. The use of such ratio is reasonable if one attempts to establish trends or to compare tax revenue performance across countries with similar economic structure and the same level of income. However, when used to compare the effectiveness in revenue mobilization across countries in different income groups, the tax-to-GDP ratio could provide a \"completely distorted\" picture due to different economic structures, institutional arrangements, and demographic trends. A number of tax economists have attempted to deal with this problem by applying an empirical approach to estimate the determinants of tax collection and identify the impact of such variables on each country's taxable capacity. The development of a tax effort index, relating the actual tax revenues of a country to its estimated taxable capacity, provides us with a tempting measure which considers country specific fiscal, demographic, and institutional characteristics. This paper employs a cross-country study to estimate tax capacity from a sample of 110 developing and developed countries during 1994-2009 and the two sub-periods of 1994-2001 and 2002-09 . In this study, we extend the empirical methodology applied by Tanzi and Davoodi (1997) , and Bird, Vazquez, and Torgler (2004) . The estimation results are used as benchmarks to compare taxable capacity and tax effort in different countries. Taxable capacity refers to the predicted tax-to-GDP ratio that can be estimated with regression analyses, taking into account a country's specific macroeconomic, demographic, and institutional features. Tax effort is defined as an index of the ratio between the share of the actual tax collection in GDP and the taxable capacity. The concepts of taxable capacity and tax effort are also extended to measure total fiscal revenue capacity and revenue effort.",

Tax revenue is positively correlated with GDP per capita, and trade openness; and negatively correlated with age dependency ratio, population growth, agriculture value added, as well as bureaucracy quality index and corruption index as defined above. When we compare these results with the correlation values reported in Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , which covered a shorter time period and a smaller sample of countries, it can be seen that the correlation between tax revenues and all other variables drops; it is especially true for GDP per capita. Given that the ratio of tax revenues as a share of GDP has been increasing, especially in the low-income and middle-income groups (see Figure 1 ), this lower correlation is expected. The only exceptions are bureaucracy quality index and corruption index; their correlation with tax revenues and total fiscal revenue gets higher. Such changes in the link between actual taxes and macroeconomic variables through time are also expected to change the predicted value of taxes.",

The R-squared are almost 0.15-0.20 points higher in the new results, indicating a better fit of empirical specifications. One interesting difference between these two sets of results is that the significance and the magnitude of the income variable (GDP per capita) drop in the new set of results. It is true especially in the specifications where institutional variables are included as determinants of taxes. While the estimated coefficient of income was around 2.2 in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it is only 1.11 in the traditional tax specification; and it gets even lower and insignificant (0.503 and 0.002 with bureaucracy index and corruption index, respectively) when the institutional variables are included in the specifications. It means that with the recent improvements in taxation in developing countries and on-going effort by highincome countries to rationalize their tax systems toward greater efficiency and lower tax burden, particularly in direct income taxes, the income level becomes less important now in determining their tax revenues. On the other hand, the institutional quality of countries is more important (even more than income levels) in determining their tax revenues. The higher significance and magnitude of the estimated coefficients of the institutional variables in the new results support this argument. For example, while the estimated coefficient of the corruption index was only -0.560 in Table 1 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it is now -1.273 and statistically more significant. This observation is also true for the bureaucracy quality index. Another difference between the old and new estimation results is that the population growth rate has almost 2/3 lower estimated coefficients now, indicating a lower impact of population growth on tax collection. Table 2 presents similar results: for total fiscal revenues, all estimation results are as expected, except GDP per capita and population growth rates in some specifications. When we compare these new results with the ones reported in Table 2 of Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) , it can be seen again that GDP per capita is less significant and has lower estimated coefficients now. It is also true for the population growth rate. On the other hand, the institutional quality indicators have higher estimated coefficients, as well as higher statistical significance.",

The estimation results are reported in Table 3 Panel A. Since the data for the size of shadow economy are limited, the total number of observations drops to 840 from 1322. But the signs and significance of coefficients are robust to the inclusion of this new variable. The size of the shadow economy is a statistically significant and negative determinant of taxes. The main exception is the case where the bureaucracy quality index is included in the regression specification. In this case, the significance of the size of the shadow economy on taxes disappears. This may indicate that the bureaucracy quality index can already well capture the impacts of shadow economy. As the bureaucracy quality drops, it gets harder to monitor the economy efficiently; thus, the size of the shadow economy tends to increase.",

Similarly, countries with a tax effort index less than 1 are included in the low tax effort group, while the ones with a tax effort index more than 1 are placed into the high tax effort group. Based on these definitions, the countries are ranked into four different categories: (i) low tax collection, low tax effort; (ii) high tax collection, high tax effort; (iii) low tax collection, high tax effort; and (iv) high tax collection, low tax effort. Table 5 gives the list of countries in each group. Given that actual and predicted taxes are positively correlated as indicated in Figure 3 , the tax effort is also positively linked to the actual tax collection.

When we check the developing countries, Botswana, Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vietnam are also new countries in the group. Both Botswana and Chile were originally in the low-effort, low-collection group, but they made it to the high-effort, highcollection group after recent improvements in revenue performance. Trinidad and Tobago was initially classified in the group of high collection-low tax effort, while Vietnam moved from the group of low collection-high tax effort. Given that the level of tax intake in this group of countries is already high and stays above their respective taxable capacity, a further increase in tax revenue collection may lead to unintended economic distortions.

They should rather aim at raising the efficiency of tax collection, including reducing tax-induced distortions and improving the business climate through further rationalizing the tax regimes, rebalancing the tax mix, and simplifying administration procedures.

A sustained approach to break this trap is to conduct important parallel reformscreating favorable legal and regulatory environment to attract private investment and at the same time revamping the tax systems to cut collection costs and minimize tax-induced economic distortions and hurdle to investment; and most importantly focusing on reforms to improve the quality of governance. Le, Moreno-Dodson, and Rojchaichaninthorn (2008) provide broad guidance for revenue reforms: Short-term tax reform measures aim to streamline tax policy and tax administration procedures to reduce compliance costs, encourage formality, and lower tax barriers to firms' entry and operations.
