        "text": "As democratic citizenship is increasingly defined in terms of social and economic, in addition to civil and political, rights, it may be time to revisit Anatole France's famous critique of formal equality before the law: -Another source of pride, to be a citizen! For the poor it consists in \u2026 laboring under the majestic equality of the laws, which prohibit the rich and the poor alike from sleeping under bridges, begging in the streets and stealing bread\u2016 (France 1922: 117-118 (our translation)). His point was that advantaged social classes are able use the law's seeming neutrality to disguise the advancement of their own interests. In this paper, we ask whether this is also true in an area of the law that seems explicitly designed to benefit the disadvantagedsocial and economic rights litigation. If any area of the law is to advance equity, it should be this oneunder the new constitutions, the rich and the poor alike are guaranteed food, a minimum standard of living, and a place to live. But even here, many have expressed skepticism, arguing that the advantaged classes have been able to use the -majesty\u2016 of these rights to capture benefits for themselves.",

        "text": "Indeed, many if not most academic accounts of the use of law to achieve social change are skeptical. Since well before 1974, when Galanter wrote -Why the Haves Come out Ahead\u2016 (Galanter 1974) , it is probably fair to summarize the conventional wisdom as follows: economic, social, and procedural barriers prevent the great majority of poor people from making claims in courts (Cappelletti and Garth 1978-79) ; accumulated experience gives the rich and the powerful advantages in the courtroom (Galanter 1974) ; patterns of judicial recruitment and retention, which reflect prevailing configurations of political power, significantly affect the attitudes and calculations of judges (Dahl 1957) ; and without the active support of elected officials, opponents can easily limit and undermine the implementation of pro-poor rulings (Rosenberg 1991) . For all these reasons, and in spite of the famous cases that seem to suggest the contrary, such as the US Supreme Court's decision in Brown v Board of Education, it seems unreasonable to expect that the courts will consistently produce outcomes that are significantly more pro-poor than the results achievable through conventional politics. In the area of health rights litigation, in particular, accounts of the Brazilian experience have increasingly begun to suggest that, when courts grant demands for medications under the right to health, they are in effect skewing public policy away from those who need it most (2007, for an argument that the courts are working on behalf of some underprivileged groups; but see Wilson 2009; Ferraz 2011) .",

Most constitutions, especially the most recent ones, have incorporated a litany of social and economic (SE) rights; and many of these constitutions, or the courts that have interpreted them, have assumed that judicial scrutiny will play an important role in realization of these rights. By definition, these rights, if taken seriously, would use law to achieve broad pro-poor agendas. And social movements are doing everything they can to make sure courts take these rights seriously, litigating a vast diversity of issues under the banner of social and economic rights (Fredman 2008 ; Gauri and Brinks 2008; Langford 2008; Heywood 2009; Gauri 2011; Yamin and Gloppen 2011) .",

In 2004 the South African Constitutional Court interpreted the constitutional right to health to require a recalcitrant Mbeki government to launch a major program to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV from mothers to infants (Heywood 2009) , an initiative that likely averted tens of thousands of HIV infections (Nattrass 2004) . In a significant recent ruling, the Brazilian apex court affirmed, on the basis of the rights to life and health, widespread support among lower courts for claims for medications and health services, a litigation stream comprising tens of thousands of cases each year (Biehl and Petryna 2011) . In India, the courts have issued a large number of rulings on the constitutional rights to health care, education, housing, the environment, nutrition, and labor, many of which have had significant effects on social policies (Fredman 2008; Shankar and Mehta 2008; Gauri 2011; Khosla 2011 ).",

The mounting evidence that courts are indeed taking important steps, with increasingly important policy consequences, has shifted the terms of the -juriskeptical\u2016 debate. From questioning the courts' capacity to accomplish anything at all (Rosenberg 1991) , the literature is now returning to the Galanterian (1974) concern that somehow the haves must be coming out ahead in all this (Da Silva and Terrazas 2011; Ferraz 2011). Who is right? Are the juriskeptical academics right, that insofar as this activity is not irrelevant, it can only be harmful? Or are the constitution writers and activists right that courts and rights can be powerful tools for advancing the interests of the 5 underprivileged? Are all these constitutions and legal actions, to the extent they are effective at all, covert vehicles for preserving privilege, or should we revise our understanding of the conventional wisdom?",

The five countries in the sample included common law countries with records of aggressive (India and South Africa) and limited SE rights litigation (Nigeria), and civil law countries with aggressive (Brazil) and incipient (Indonesia) litigation. They included countries with (by global standards) recent and old constitutions, and countries with varying years of democratic experience. Judicial review is abstract and centralized in Indonesia; concrete and diffuse in India, Nigeria, and South Africa; and a blend in Brazil. The countries also vary in levels of national income and state capacity. The survey sought to unearth a complete or representative sample of cases in each country involving the right to health and health care, and the right to education. 1 These two issue areas provide further within-country variation. Importantly for our theory, the countries vary in the extent to which SE rights litigation is characterized by decisions with broad applicability beyond the individual case, or by individual cases with individual remedies. We draw on some of this variation to answer questions about the social, economic, political, and institutional conditions that affect the distributive effect of SE rights litigation.",

        "text": "We have two related concerns with the existing literature on the distributive impact of litigation. The first is that too much of the literatureperhaps because it is for the most part based on single country case studiesassumes or implies that all courts have a similar pro-poor potential, and too often presents categorical conclusions for courts in all times and places, regardless of their individual features or social and political context. The second is that the more structural accounts of courts' alleged shortcomings miss the role of politics and agency in modifying the impact of structure, underestimating the capacity of social groups and litigants to turn courts to their own purposes. In this paper we try to address these two issues. We offer some hypotheses regarding the characteristics of courts and legal systems that should produce variation in the extent to which benefits extend to the poor, showing that not all courts are the same. We examine how structural constraints that could lead courts to privilege the already privileged might yield to determined mobilization on behalf of the underprivileged. And we examine the actual results of patterns of legal mobilization that brings health care and education issues to the courts for resolution. included all available cases at any level after the new constitution of 1998, a total of twelve; and in Nigeria it included federal court decisions going back to 1979 (when the Nigerian constitution first recognized social and economic rights), and all available cases in three selected states (Lagos, Rivers, and Kano), resulting in a total of 46 cases. With this information it was possible to calculate the number of SE cases reaching courts; the likelihood that plaintiffs succeed; and, on the basis of interviews of judges, advocates, and others involved in the cases, as well as a review of the secondary literature, the level of implementation. This present paper builds on the data on success rates and overall implementation to analyze the distributional effects of the cases.",

Where better data are available, we clarify and correct their estimates. All the data on which we rely are systematized and presented in a data Appendix, which is available from the authors. Since the boundaries of the -disadvantaged\u2016 category are not entirely clear, and since the data in a few cases do not allow us to use the same definition of -disadvantaged\u2016 across different countries, we estimate the potential pro-poor impact of litigation by examining whether the poor, defined in nearly all cases as those in the bottom two income quartiles, are over-or under-represented among the beneficiaries of litigation relative to their share of the population.",

By our measure, it is close to distribution-neutral in Indonesia and in Brazil, raising a counterpoint to the literature's findings about the regressive effect of health rights litigation in that latter country. And it is sharply anti-poor in Nigeria. To summarize the argument and findings, we predict, and find, that countries and policy areas characterized by judicial decisions with broader applicability beyond the litigants tend to avoid the presumed anti-poor bias of courts, while areas dominated by individual litigation and individualized effects are less likely to have pro-poor outcomes. Even where results in fact generalize beyond litigants, we find that the more a system relies on litigation that is expected to have only individual effects, the more that litigation will center on high-end state benefits, rather than low-cost goods, and thus will be less progressive.

        "text": "To begin with, it is useful to distinguish general skepticism about law and redistribution from the more particular analysis we are making here concerning the distributive effects of social and economic rights litigation. The law as such touches every aspect of social life, and it is not easy to confirm or disprove general predictions concerning the distributive consequences of legal institutions as diverse as human rights, criminal law and penal reform, bankruptcy proceedings, anti-corruption laws, and judicial review. Galanter (1974) , in the area of civil litigation, claims that -the haves\u2016 always come out ahead, when it comes to litigating their interests. Hirschl agrees, on the subject of judicial review, contending that courts and constitutions represent conservative elite interests, and that, in interpreting constitutional rights, they advance -a predominantly neo-liberal conception of rights that reflects and promotes the ideological premises of the new \u2017global economic order'social atomism, anti-unionism, formal equality, and \u2017minimal state' policies\u2016 (Hirschl 2000 (Hirschl : 1063 . On the other hand, Dworkin (1986: 356) claims that -the United States is a more just society than it would have been had its constitutional rights been left to the conscience of majoritarian institutions.\u2016 But it is hard to imagine a convincing empirical strategy for testing such comprehensive claims; our aim is slightly more modest. Our concern is not with -law,\u2016 or with -judicial review,\u2016 or even with -litigation,\u2016 but rather with litigation seeking to enforce some vision of social and economic rights. Even here, broad categorical statements about whether litigation strategies are regressive or progressive are likely wrong simply because there are so many different kinds of litigation strategies that seek so many different goals on behalf of such radically different groups. What we offer here, is (a) a way to realistically evaluate the impact of litigation on the underprivileged, and (b) a theoretical account of what kinds of litigation might be more or less problematic Our hypotheses build on the simple economics of litigation: the more the expected results of the litigation are tied to the litigants themselves, the less pro-poor should be their effect.",

This is so for two basic reasons: First, if benefits accrue only to those who actually litigate, then only those who have the capacity to overcome all the barriers to access to justice will benefit. Secondly, when benefits are limited to litigants, then the individual benefit being demanded must justify the full cost of litigation, and litigation will tend to focus on higherend goods and services rather than on the full range of needs the poor might have, including the need for basic, primary services. On the other hand, if benefits generalize beyond actual litigants, then (a) those who cannot afford to (and do not) litigate can still benefit, and (b) the aggregate benefit of even very low cost interventions (e.g.,, the <$5/dose Nevirapine treatments that were the subject of the TAC case, in South Africa) can justify relatively expensive (third party-funded) litigation.

While much of the literature is concerned with Provision cases (Bergallo 2005; Ferraz 2011 ; Yamin and Gloppen 2011), Gauri and Brinks show that, with the exception of Brazil, legal petitions requesting direct state provision of a particular good form the minority of social and economic rights cases in every country in their study.

The benefits of new forms of regulation are genuine (if not pure) public goods, in that they are largely non-depletable and non-excludable. So long as disadvantaged individuals, actually or potentially, utilize the services subject to the new forms of regulation, they should benefit. These cases have the greatest progressive potential. Obligation cases, even when they generalize, primarily benefit those who already have access to a serviceas Odinkalu (2008) puts it, they are rights in, not rights to, education or health care. These cases have the least potential to benefit the poor, at least in areas involving basic service provision, where the poor often remain unserved; on the other hand, it is not clear that they take anything away from the poor, in that they merely readjust the rights and obligations running between providers of health care and education, for example, and the people they serve.

The more SE rights enforcement relies on Obligation cases, on the other hand, the more likely it is to benefit the better off (although with little if any direct negative effect on the poor). Finally, the effect of Provision cases depends largely on whether or not they generalize: individual cases with individual remedies and no spillover effects should target high cost goods and benefit more affluent populations; collective cases, or those that produce broad public policy changes have the potential for much stronger pro-poor effects. At the same time, we expect individual Provision cases to have the least significant impact. These cases, by definition, affect smaller numbers of people than Regulation and Obligation cases. The aggregation of thousands of individual medications cases, as in Brazil, Colombia or Costa Rica, can ultimately have a large effect, but in order to get thousands of cases it is necessary to radically democratize access to the courts (see, e.g., Wilson 2009) , thus extending the potential benefits further down the socio-economic gradient.

But decisions can also have direct and indirect effects on nonlitigants, as when litigants sue for (de facto) non-excludable goods (e.g., higher quality care in a hospital, or a handicap access ramp in a school), or when decisions change public policies in some way. In such cases, the benefits are extended to all those who share a policy space with the litigants.

One can enjoy the benefits of these indirect effects without having the resources to litigate, but only if one shares the same policy environment as the litigants. Often that means geographic proximity, a similar social class, or both. So, if a wealthy family sues to secure a ramp to their daughter's elementary school or to improve services at a hospital, everyone who attends the school or uses the hospital enjoys the benefit. But one must share a school or a hospital with this wealthy family to benefit, and the wealthy seldom share schools with the poor; they sometimes share public hospitals, but rarely primary care physicians with the poor. In short, benefitting in this way requires a close identification with the issues involved in the original litigation, even if it does not depend on being able to litigate. The crucial question, therefore, is to what extent does SE litigation generate non-excludable goods that are broadly shared across social classes? The concern, which Gauri and Brinks call policy area inequality, is that litigation will turn the state's attention away from policy areas that are the primary concern of the poor, and toward policy areas that are not shared spaces with the poor. As further explained below, our focus in this paper is precisely on policy area inequality. This is, in the end, the challenge we take on most directly. Where they seem to dominate, we will tally the socio-economic status of the litigants themselves, but our focus is on the broader, indirect effects, which seem more important to the overall distributive effect of litigation. In order to examine the consequences of this impact, we identify the areas in which the results of judicial decisions generalized to broader populations, and we determine as best we can the socio-economic composition and size of the beneficiary class. We then calculate a weighted average of the expected beneficiaries in each class, to evaluate the extent of policy area inequality. In the next section we summarize the results of our investigation for the five countries included in the Gauri and Brinks study, and then compare these results to our theoretical expectations.",

This is a more conservative estimate of the extent to which the poor benefit, for two reasons. First, we rely on surveys of people who have already been diagnosed with a particular disease, and thus who have at some point at least come into contact with medical care; once diagnosed, and given that the SUS will treat the disease free of charge, it is likely that even the poor will get treatment. It is not the case, then, that we are imputing from the prevalence of the disease among people who have no access to health care at all. Moreover, while it is possible that some low-income people never return for care after their initial diagnosis, it is at least as likely that some high-income people continue to receive private medical care for their conditions. Table 2 summarizes the results of our investigation for Brazil's health cases. Ironically, after all the twists and turns of this calculation, the distribution of indirect beneficiaries is not far from the population distribution across income levels: about 36% of beneficiaries come from the bottom 2 income quintiles. Moreover, recall that about 43% of SUS users come from this income strand. In other words, not only is the income distribution among indirect beneficiaries close to the income distribution in the population, but it is also reasonably close to the income distribution of SUS users -36% compared to 43%.

All of these were likely disadvantaged, as it is the lowest income girls who are prevented from attending school due to a lack of food in household. We estimate that over 7 million students benefited from the program's nutritional effects. Similar calculations for other cases are in Table 6 .

Summarizing, some have argued that courts will not be able to benefit poor beneficiaries because of inequalities in access to justice (Galanter 1974; Cappelletti and Garth 1978-79) , because of the attitudes and strategic calculations of the judiciary (Dahl 1957) , and as a result of the ability of opponents to undermine implementation (Rosenberg 1991) . Those arguments have usually been made in categorical terms, but we can examine the extent to which they, rather than the breadth of applicability of rulings, which is our preferred explanation, are more persuasive in explaining the variation in distributive impact that we observe. For the countries we have examined, Table 8 shows measures of access to justice (cases per 10 million in the countries in our sample); the win rates of for litigants in health and education rights cases; the extent to which the executive branch usually implements social and economic rights rulings, as observed by the analysts in the Gauri and Brinks volume, and our indicator variable for the breadth of applicability of court rulings.",

In summary, for all the seemingly commonsensical reasons to expect litigation to be an elite game, the evidence does not support a finding that only the better off benefit. In fact, in many of the categories, the primary beneficiaries of the cases in our sample were the underprivileged. When we examine the socio-demographic characteristics of the people benefited in our sample of cases, we find that approximately 55% of them are likely to be poor, uneducated, or otherwise underprivileged in some significant way. It is true, then, that litigation does not, with important exceptions, target primary health care; but it is not true that it does not target primary education. It is true that some of the cases are brought by middle class people or people who fit some definition of privilege (such as the white Afrikaans-speaking population of South Africa), but not true that these cases dominate, either in number of cases or number of beneficiaries. This is strong evidence that human rights litigation on behalf of social and economic rights is not inherently regressive.",

Cross-country and cross-policy area differences in the number of cases counsel against aggregating across these cells, but on average these cells include only 23% underprivileged beneficiaries, while the cells where we expected a more progressive effect include, on average, 70% underprivileged beneficiaries. Even if we drop the cells with very small numbers (say, less than one thousand), the cases with more regressive expected effects average 27% underprivileged, while the cells where we expected more pro-poor outcomes average a full 67% underprivileged. The discussion above and in the Appendix suggests that nearly all cases have some indirect effects. The difference between Provision cases in Brazil versus those in India, Indonesia and South Africa, is that the indirect effects are tied to, and the product of, individual cases that This does not, as noted at the very outset, answer all the questions we might want to ask.In order to determine whether using the courts is more or less regressive than appealing to the legislature, we would now have to perform a similar analysis of the beneficiaries of legislative decision-making in the areas of health and education, perhaps looking at the same time frame.We might compare this outcome to the existing socio-economic profile of beneficiaries of public policy programs in Brazil and South Africa and to the distributive effect of legislative decisionmaking since the advent of democracy in those countries. We know from other research that education policy in Brazil (as in the rest of Latin America) has traditionally been strongly regressive, because of the emphasis on free tertiary education, and that democracy has begun to redress this pattern (Brown and Hunter 2004) . At the same time, analyses of public spending in Brazil across a variety of issues including health and education show that this pro-poor impulse did not come at the expense of spending on programs that are near and dear to the more privileged (Hunter and Sugiyama 2009: 48-49) . Given the results detailed above, it seems likely that there will not be a dramatic difference in the pro-poor effect of recent legislative and judicial decision-making.",

Until we get to the fifth quintile in the income distribution, the various socio-economic strata are approximately equally represented: the 20% of the population with the lowest income accounts for 22.8% of users, the next 20%, for 23.8%, and the next two for 22.4% and 21.8%, respectively. It is only the top quintile that is sharply underrepresented. Thus for low cost medications, we simply assume that the indirect beneficiaries mirror the demographics of typical SUS users, so that 46.6% of them come from the bottom two quintiles (and thus have per capita family incomes below about $60 USD/month, according to Ribeiro).",
