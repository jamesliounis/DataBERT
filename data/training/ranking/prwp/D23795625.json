This has lead researchers on a quest to unlock the mechanisms that encourage greater entrepreneurship with the goal of promoting compatible economic policies. A key feature of this literature has been the size of government -specifically the size of government spending -which several studies have found to have a negative relationship with entrepreneurship (see Aidis et al., 2012 for a review of the literature). The intuition is twofold. First, high levels of government spending tend to be a proxy for the level of government involvement in the economy implying more burdensome regulations imposed by the government. Increasing burden of government regulations tends to discourage entrepreneurship.",

However, under this scenario it is typically assumed that there are no credit market imperfections. Thus, while the literature has argued for the moral hazard disincentive mechanisms for entrepreneurship and social spending, the presence of credit market failures may invert the relationship whereby social spending can increase human capital investment, potentially increasing an individual's likelihood of engaging in entrepreneurship activity. Of course, which mechanism dominates cannot be known a priori and is essentially an empirical question. In addition to social spending, increasing government spending in the usual public goods such as law and order and infrastructure may create an environment that is conducive for entrepreneurial activity. Individuals are more likely to start businesses if they believe their investments are protected. Improved transportation and communication infrastructure may increase the degree of connectivity and networks required for innovative entrepreneurship.",

        "text": "This study empirically addresses the central hypothesis of whether a reallocation of government spending from private subsidies to social and public goods under credit market imperfections encourages entrepreneurial activity. Our analysis exploits the GEM database, which covers 50 developed and developing economies between 2001 and 2009 and which includes all startups, regardless of their legal status. The Global Enterprise Monitor survey (GEM) covers at least 2,000 individuals annually in each country. The individual level data (approximately 650,000 usable observations) are generated through surveys which enabled the production of stratified samples, drawn from the data which correspond to the whole working age population in each participating country. Our empirical approach is to exploit individual level variation in entrepreneurship activity and cross-country variation in government spending. To achieve this we combine cross-country microeconomic individual level data with country-specific government spending data from the IMF's Government Financial Statistics database (GFS). Most of the literature has focused on total entrepreneurial activity which includes self-employment. We follow Estrin and Mickiewicz (2011) and focus on entrepreneurs that aspire to create 10 or more jobs, which is important for economic growth. We include several individual level controls from the GEM data set and macroeconomic controls from the World Bank Development Indicators (WDI). Concerns about simultaneity bias are ameliorated in our use of aggregate explanatory variables because the individual decision of a potential entrepreneur should not affect country-level institutions or economic development. However, endogeneity may arise because the mean country-level individual entry outcome may affect some of the country-level variables, so we lag all our macroeconomics and institutional variables by one year.",

There is a theoretical literature on government subsidies and entrepreneurial activity (see Li, 2002 for a review). Using a general equilibrium analysis Li (2002) presents a theoretical model where it finds that pro poor income programs are more likely improve entrepreneurial activity than targeted interest rate subsidies. Of course, the results for pro poor income programs are qualified by possible offsets by distortionary taxes to fund the increase in such programs.

This accounts both for unobserved heterogeneity across countries and also measurement error and idiosyncrasies that are country-year sample specific. This estimation model has been found to be a better fit for the GEM data set than country effects as the data set is highly imbalanced with countries appearing once or twice. Furthermore, broad compositional changes in government spending within a country take a long time, and the main variation comes from across countries. Therefore country fixed effects may wash out the more important cross-country variation in government spending.

This may shed some light on the relationship between total government spending and entrepreneurship. One possible interpretation of this result is that an expansion of government spending usually includes a sizeable increase in private subsidies which tend to be detrimental for entrepreneurship activity.

We identify a specific financing source for social and public good spending -which is private subsidies. We cannot say with certainty that the same effects will prevail when increased taxes or government debt is used to finance such expenditures. Second, while our study does provide explicit policy recommendations, in practice such policies may be difficult to carry out. Eliminating certain private subsidies or defense spending is likely to be political unfavorable, thus making a spending compositional change policy hard to implement.",
