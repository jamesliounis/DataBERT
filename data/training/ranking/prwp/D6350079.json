        "text": "There was substantial spatial variation in labor market outcomes in Brazil over the 1990's. In 2000, about one-fifth of workers lived in apparently economically stagnant municipios where real wages declined but employment increased faster than the national population growth rate. More than one-third lived in apparently dynamic municipios experiencing both real wage growth and faster-than-average employment growth; these areas absorbed more than half of net employment growth over the period. To elucidate this spatial variation, we estimated spatial labor supply and demand equations describing wage and employment changes of Brazilian munic\u00edpios. We used Conley's spatial GMM technique to allow for instrumental variable estimation in the presence of spatially autocorrelated errors. Chief findings include: a very strong influence of initial workforce educational levels on subsequent wage growth (controlling for possibly confounding variables such as remoteness and climate); evidence of positive spillover effects of ownmunicipio growth onto neighbors' wage and employment levels; an exodus from farming areas; relatively elastic response of wages to an increase in labor supply; and evidence of a local multiplier effect from government transfers.",

The underlying assumption is that targeting regional development policies on these poorer regions could simultaneously reduce aggregate poverty and regional inequality, and thereby reduce migration to large urban centers. Some of these policies include federal and state incentives for industrial location in lagging areas; provision of basic education; infrastructure development including dams and roads; support for agriculture, including familial agriculture, and community-driven development projects. More recently there has been an interest in a 'territorial approach', which would promote integrated development in a secondary city and its rural hinterland. This approach emphasizes improvement of urban amenities and services as a means of unlocking local growth.",

The income per capita ratio of the richest State and the poorest one was 8.9 in 1960 and 6.2 in 1996. (Azzoni et al., 2000) . The 2000 figure was 7.7. This analysis can be extended also to social indicators such as the human development index (HDI). Out of the 10 cities with the worst HDI in Brazil, seven were in the Northeast in 1991 and eight in 2000. 2 Within regions, there are substantial inequalities between states and among munic\u00edpios.

However, several papers find evidence that this convergence process stalled after 1985, with one or two groups of poor states tending towards a lower-income equilibrium than the richer part of Brazil.

They divided their dataset in cohorts and used a large list of variables as determinants of growth, including microdata from PNAD -National Household Survey.

The North and Northeast of the country lag far behind other regions in quantity and quality of education, and these differentials are strongly correlated with differences in labor income, as human capital theory would suggest (Fiess and Werner 2004) . However, education and other observable individual characteristics do not fully explain interregional wage and income differentials. Azzoni e Santos (2002) compared the differences in salary in the 10 largest Brazilian metropolitan areas in 1992, 1995 and 1997. Those salary differences remained significant even after controlling for cost of living measures, the traits of the workers (education, age, sex, race and family position) and the traits of their jobs (occupational position, sector and experience). Fiess and Werner (2004) estimated mover/stayer models of wage and migration. They found that low-education Northeasterners could boost their wages by 80% through migration; the differential declined with higher levels of education. Evidently, judging from the evidence cited above, the substantial degree of interregional migration is not sufficient to induce convergence between the regions.",

For instance, Projeto Alvorada sought to provide education and other services to states (and later microregions) with below-median HDI. Individual states use fiscal incentives to influence intrastate location of industrial firms, but the scope and impact of these programs is not comprehensively known. Other programs were not explicitly regional in intent but may nonetheless have had differential regional impacts. Possibly the most important of these is transport. Brazil's transport infrastructure has improved markedly over the last 40 years (Castro 2003) . Lall, Funderberg, and Yepes (2005) show that the productivity of manufacturing firms tends to increase with decreasing transport cost to S\u00e3o Paulo, the country's industrial hub. On the other hand, increased access to S\u00e3o Paulo or other metropolitan centers exposes local firms to increased competition from possibly more efficient firms, so the net effect on regional development is indeterminant. Another important policy affecting regional development was EMBRAPA's development of soybean varieties adapted to low latitudes. This innovation was responsible for the massive expansion of soybean cultivation in the Center West after 1970.",

Most of these are in the tradition of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) , and are concerned with the detection of convergence in per capita income levels or growth rates across the subnational units. The models are sparsely parameterized; growth is represented primarily as a function of prior-period per capita income, possibly with some structural conditioning variables. This approach is not ideal for the present purpose because there is little scope for exploring the impact of policy interventions such as infrastructure investments. When policy-relevant variables are included as conditioning factors, they are constrained to affect growth rates rather than income or employment levels.",

Hence local investments may be effective in alleviating poverty even if they do not result in a perceptible change in wages. It is possible, instead, that they attract labor from lower wage areas.

The labor market approach has several advantages for our purposes over Barro-type growth models. First, our model offers potentially better insight into poverty alleviation strategies because it looks at wages rather than GDP/capita -an important consideration when wealth is unequally distributed. Second, while the growth models use regions as units of concern, looking only at mean income levels, the labor market approach looks also at employment. It is entirely possible for regional mean incomes to diverge even while incomes of individuals increase, if employment expands faster in higher-wage markets. Models focused only on mean income may entirely overlook such an outcome. Third, growth models typically employ a sparse set of policy-relevant variables. Here we examine the impact of a range of policy levers, including education, infrastructure, and transfers, while allowing for differential effects in regions with different agroclimatic conditions. Finally, our fine-scaled geographic approach facilitates an examination of local growth spillovers, allowing examination of the premises of territorial development policies.",

Although the 1991 total fertility rate for these MCAs was a full point lower than that of the E+W-areas, the dynamic areas had a substantial higher proportion of recent immigrants in 2000; this suggests that these regions are growing via immigration, presumably drawn by economic opportunity.

Failure to account for this autocorrelation could lead to inaccurate estimates of standard errors. To address this issue, we use the GMM technique of Conley (1999) (as did Araujo, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2004 and Baicker 2005) . In contrast to the more standard spatial econometric approach using a weight matrix, Conley's nonparametric technique requires only that users locate data points in a real or virtual space. Users specify a cutoff distance beyond which spatial autocorrelation is thought to be unimportant. For our analysis we use the latitude and longitude of the MCA centroid to locate the data points. This technique is attractive because it is computationally feasible for large numbers of observations; allows for the use of instrumental variables; and is robust to misspecification of the degree of autocorrelation among neighboring observations.
