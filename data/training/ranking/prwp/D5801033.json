The WTO Dispute Settlement Body addressed these measures and as a consequence, Argentina dismantled most of them, leading to four main conclusions.",

Probably under the belief that the Agreement on Safeguards that at the time was being negotiated would eventually provide the legal basis to sustain its \"safeguard\" measures, Argentina did not negotiate a market reserve at the Uruguay Round. Within Mercosur, the error in political calculus was associated with the Tratado de Asunci\u00f3n that, after a short adjustment period, banned the use of safeguards for regulating intra-regional trade flows. Nevertheless at the time when this Treaty was signed in 1991, imports triggered by the unilateral trade liberalization program were still much lower than the levels they would reach two years later.

It also contrasts with market reserves negotiated by industrial countries for their footwear industries. For example, in 1993 Japan applied quotas for leather footwear imports and also fixed custom duties according to material used. Since 1994, the European Union applied a system of quotas on imports from China and Hong Kong and there also was an antidumping measure on Chinese footwear imports of around 50%. (European Confederation of the Footwear Industry, 1995) The US is the country that is more open to imports, and this has resulted in an almost total migration of manufacturing activities to developing countries (Shetty 1995 , American Apparel & Footwear Association, 2004 and US. International Trade Commission, 1999 . On the other hand, several developed countries enjoy escalation in their tariff structures (CNCE 1997 and Trade Development Council, 2003) .

Ad valorem duties on casual footwear (e.g., athletic footwear, sport oxfords, sneakers, and espadrilles) currently range from 20 to 67%\u2026\" Concerning the effects of the Uruguay Round, these authors state that \"the evidence indicates that the footwear industry in industrial countries emerged relatively unscratched\". Supporting this view, de Paiva Abreu (1996 page 66) asserts that while the average tariff reduction implemented by developed countries on industrial products was 28%, the reduction for footwear imports was only 6.1% i.e., the lowest among the sample of industries included in this study.",

The availability of abundant raw material and relatively low wages favored the development of clusters that became highly efficient. In the early1990s this industry comprised 8,500 companies, which employed more than 300.000 workers (Salazar deBuckle, 2001, andBekerman et al., 2000).15 In this industry, the incidence of labor costs is very important. For example, the national economic census of 1994 shows that in 1993 salaries represented 59.3% of gross value added in leather footwear manufacturing, 58.8% in the case of footwear made of fabric, plastic and other materials, and 57.8% in footwear parts manufacturing.

When the investigation was launched, Argentina established provisional safeguard measures consisting in new DIEMs, which were almost identical to the ones that had been abolished. The decision to initiate an investigation under WTO rules was triggered by consultations requested by the United States and the European Commission (EC) under the WTO dispute settlement regulations. These consultations referred to the compatibility of the DIEMs on textiles and footwear with the tariff-ceiling binding by Argentina in the Uruguay Round 19",

Although the application of the DIEMs was not legally based on GATT Article XIX, at the time when the measures were introduced in late 1993, they did not violate any of the multilateral rules. The measures adopted in favor of two labor-intensive industries (textiles and footwear) worked as an element of political balance in the framework of a major structural reform program which, as mentioned in Section II, was accompanied by a strong growth of imports and increasing unemployment rates.However, once the commitments of the Uruguay Round were accepted, in which Argentina binded the maximum tariff at 35%, a conflict arose between the measures in existence and the new rules. By initiative of the United States and the EC, the WTO dispute settlement system was activated, and in the end most of the measures had to be dismantled.The first case, \"Argentina -Measures that affect imports of footwear, textiles, apparel and other articles\" (See Section IV.2), was initiated by the United States and as said, this case ended with Argentina eliminating the measures in favor of textiles and apparel.27  Then, when Argentina's CNCE arrived at a positive determination in favor of the footwear industry, the EC initiated a second case(WTO 1999).",
