        "text": "This paper describes the methodology and findings for the extreme hazard exposure analysis of the Chinese wastewater sector to flooding and earthquakes hazards. This analysis is undertaken for changing flooding, under climate scenarios, and earthquake exposure of a spatially accurate wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) database for China, covering a total of 1,346 assets with additional attributes quantifying the treatment capacity and users dependent on each plant. For flooding, we apply and downscale a global river routing (CaMa-Flood) model that quantifies the change degree of flood exposures from the present time-period to the near future time-period (2016-2035) to a far future time period (2036) (2037) (2038) (2039) (2040) (2041) (2042) (2043) (2044) (2045) (2046) (2047) (2048) (2049) (2050) (2051) (2052) (2053) (2054) (2055) . We find evidence that most climate models project increasing number of WWTP assets face climate-induced flood hazards in both the near and far future, potentially affecting as many as 208 million users by 2050. However, there are spatial and temporal variations from these projections which means that planning for resilient wastewater infrastructure requires more detailed understanding of the vulnerability attributes of WWTPs including their exact location, the number of users they serve as well as their flood protection standards. For earthquakes, we examine the exposure of WWTPs to earthquake hazards through both seismic shaking and induced liquefaction. Overall, we demonstrate the significant risk that earthquakes can have on the WWTP process-especially on centralized systems. By considering liquefaction susceptibility in combination with shaking, we expose a number of WWTPs that face an increased level of exposure to damages following earthquakes compared to looking at shaking in isolation.",

In the far future, all 11 models agree that there will be a net increase in plant exposures and user impacts for all 1 in 50 and 1 in 100 flood exceedance probability events. \uf0b7 Under RCP8.5 emission scenarios, 9 out of 11 climate models are in complete agreement of a net increase in plant exposure numbers and user impacts for all flood exceedance probabilities in the near future. In the far future, all 11 models agree that there will be a net increase in plant exposures and user numbers for all 1 in 100 flood exceedance probability events. \uf0b7 The net user impacts of increasing flooding exposures for events exceeding 1 in 30 return periods can be as high as approximately 180 million in the near future under RCP 4.5 emission scenarios, which potentially grows to about 208 million in the far future. The averages of net users facing increasing exposures increases from 47 to 61 million between the near and far futures. \uf0b7 The changes under RCP 8.5 are similarly severe with about 121 million net users impacts from increasing WWTPs flooding for events exceeding 1 in 30 return periods in the near future, which potentially grows to about 187 million in the far future. The averages of net users facing increasing exposures increases from 40 to 72 million between the near and far futures. \uf0b7 Spatially we observe that in the near future, flood hazards for RCP 4.5 are concentrated along the Yangtze River, in southern Hubei, northern Hunan, central Anhui, northern Jiangxi and Shanghai, all of which are highly populated and the WWTPs here serve high numbers of users. Provinces such as Guangxi, Guizhou and Ningxia face wide-spread increasing flood hazard whereas Shaanxi (north), Shandong (northwest), Qinghai (centralnorth), Heilongjiang (east), Tibet (central) experience regional specific flood hazard. Although the WWTPs here serve less users in general, if existing ones are not designed to an appropriate level, they will face increase flooding hazards. \uf0b7 In the far future, flooding hazard escalate in large parts of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. The WWTPs located in these regions, not previously exposed to flooding hazards at return period 50, now face increasing risks. For RCP8.5, concentrations of increasing flooding probability are similar to RCP4.5 during the period 2016-2035, along the Yangtze River. Notable differences are in regions such as northern Heilongjiang and northern Inner Mongolia, which suffer increasing flood hazard whereas they do not in RCP4.5. By 2055, hazards become widespread with very few areas left intact.",

In this report, we make use of an accurate dataset to identify the number and locations of Chinese wastewater treatment plants exposed to changing probabilities flooding in the context of climate change, as well as those plants that are exposed to significant earthquakes. We limit wastewater network impacts to treatment plant facilities, ignoring any conveyance infrastructure, overflows, and pumping assets located upstream. Further to this analysis, we calculate the number of users each WWTP asset serves, according to population and usage data. Only direct outage, i.e. those caused directly by the hazard are considered. Outages caused by dependent infrastructures, such as to electricity networks supplying the WWTPs are not considered herein.",

As we do not know the exact location for each plant, we resort to a thorough process of searching plant addresses online and geocoding these in Google Earth and/or Baidu to our database. We then validate this dataset with Google Satellite Images to verify their exact locations. Unfortunately, the location information of several of these treatment plants is either missing or inaccurate, with sometimes the stated plants locations being kilometers away from their actual locations as seen by satellite imagery. As such, we were able to locate 1,346 WWTPs, out of the orginial number 2,743. It is noted that the assets are represented as points in the centroid of the WWTPs, as opposed to the locations of control rooms or elsewhere. In addition, we only focus on complete facilities rather than individual assets within the plants and do not consider exposure differences in treatment stages within a plant nor do we taken into account of the type/quality of outlets which may affect the extent to which WWPTs are impacted post-disasters.

As these were created at the global scale, we note that they may underestimate the hazard in local areas for fault lines not captured in historical catalogues. As a result, rather than relying on absolute values of horizontal acceleration, we instead group PGA into five discrete categories: Very High VH (>0.65g), High H (0.34g -0.65g), Medium M (0.18g -0.34g), Low L (0.092g -0.18g), and Very Low VL (<0.092g). It should be noted that these labels are qualitative, and the actual impacts do not necessarily correlate with the description given the great variability in local conditions and design standards.",

These are based on a readily available dataset created for use at the global scale (Zorn and Koks, 2019) using a calibrated geospatial prediction model (Zhu, Baise and Thompson, 2017) . This approach defines liquefaction susceptibility based on a range of parameters such as: distance to rivers, depth to groundwater, annual precipitation, distance to coast, and 30-m averaged shear wave velocity (Vs30). As with PGA, site specifics such as soil drainage, the use of infill, and Vs30 (amongst others) are overlooked in the method. Regardless, this method has shown promising predictive capacity and is adopted in a number of national and global applications (Lin et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019) (Lin et al. 2018 , Koks et al. 2019 .",

        "text": "We draw two main conclusions from this analysis. First, there will be more assets and users that face increasing flood hazards in both the near future by 2035 and far future by 2055 ( Figures 1-4 ). However, this number varies depending on the individual model and return periods examined. For instance, the highest from Model BCC-CSM1-1 projects the number of assets exposed to net increase flooding hazards is 472 and a potential 17.5 million users could be affected for RCP 4.5 at return period 30 by 2035. The lowest for the same set of assumptions projects 29 and a potential of 7.8 million affected users. In particular, we find that the number of assets and their users facing net increasing flooding hazards are almost always higher for a lower return period than a higher return period, implying that the focus on extreme events is often overlooked and we should be paying more attention to flood risks at lower magnitudes. . WWTP and user exposure to net change (positive, zero or negative) of flood hazards for all models at return periods greater than 1 in 30, 1 in 50 and 1 in 100 years for RCP8.5. Time period: (1986-2005) to (2036-2055) Second, the spatial variation is extremely important for planning climate resilient infrastructure as exposure of infrastructures to natural hazards is highly location-sensitive. To demonstrate this, we select WWTPs and superimpose changing flooding hazard maps for return period > 50, varying RCP and time period for model MPI-ESM-LR ( Figure 5 ). This model represents the medium range of all models, which is a reasonable scenario of flooding extent in the future periods concerned.",
