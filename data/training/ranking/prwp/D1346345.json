Suppliers in these sectors tend to be either subsidiaries of MNCs or operate in outsourcing within MNC networks of manufacturing and distribution. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that furniture producers tend to be integrated into larger retailers. Therefore, we shall refer to them as production and marketing networks. Table 1 identifies SITC categories for parts, components and final products of these four production networks. Although networks correspond to SITC divisions (two-digit classification), components and parts from other SITC divisions have been occasionally included. For instance, the telecommunication network embraces TV tubes, electronic microcircuits, etc. as well as parts used in their production. The reason is that these may be used as components in the production of TV and radio receivers. Similarly, SITC items in a motor vehicle production network (SITC 78) include engines (7132), electrical equipment used in motor vehicles (7783) as well as parts for special vehicles-works trucks for handling of cargo (74411). The SITC Rev. 2 system falls well short of allowing precise estimates of foreign trade activity within a network. Leaving aside standard weaknesses of foreign trade statistics, the problem is that it does not allow distinguish among various uses of a part or component. For instance, piston engines (7132) include a whole array of engines for cars, trucks, tractors, works trucks and armored vehicles. Parts (7139) include not only parts for piston engines (7132) but also parts used in production of engines for boats (7133).

But trade deficit in parts is hardly surprising. Consider that highly developed countries run trade surplus in parts, especially high in such large items as parts of motor vehicles and parts of telecommunication equipment (Yeats 1998) . If anything, this demonstrates that fragmentation of 1993 1993 1998 1998 1993 1993 1998 1998 production involves moving production facilities to less developed countries with parts supplied from highly developed countries.

CEEC seem to have become part of this global trend, which indicates that they are not missing the boat of emerging global division of labor based on production fragmentation. The share of parts in their trade has been on the increase, although not in all major SITC double-digit groups. Furthermore, data for Malaysia, Mexico as well as for some CEEC suggest that at some point exports tend to grow faster than imports. Another symptom of the likely involvement in a finer and deeper international division of labor is the increase of the share of parts in imports of a given product category. While one may not discount the possibility that some of these operations involve assembly due to high effective rates of protection of final products, high import content also indicates upgrading of final products. Three observations can be derived from Table 5 , which provides information on the part content in imports in major two-digit SITC product groups. First and foremost, a very considerable overall increase in the share of parts in total imports of products (made of them) by about one-third from 21 percent in 1993 to 28 percent in 1998 points to the growing involvement of CEEC-10 in division of labor based on fragmentation of production. Note that the 'part content' of imports increased for all identified product categories. The value of these imports increased more than three-fold between 1993 and 1998 and grew 19 percent in 1998. The highest growth in 1998 that occurred in \"other transport equipment\" (75% increase in 1998) and \"office machines and equipment\" (72%) suggests CEEC growing involvement in international networks (see Section 5).",

These imports may be used for producing a final product sold domestically rather than shipped back to feed a global production process. If these imports are further processed, as production fragmentation would impose, and then delivered for further processing in another country, then foreign trade data should capture these transactions. Thus, at a minimum, there should be not only imports but also exports of parts within the same product category. Although without firm-specific data one can be never sure whether the import-export transaction does not involve completely different firms, i.e., firms operating in different production and distribution networks, there is at least likelihood that production sharing occurs. This leads to the third modification. Since the likelihood increases when a product has RCA exceeding unity for both producing (as measured on exports) and assembly operation, we use the values of RCA in the manufacture and assembly jointly to identify the phenomenon of production sharing. The intuition is as follows: A double RCA (above unity) means more specialization in exports of part i and relatively larger imports of part i than in the EU.",

Taking first the extent to which export earnings (aggregate value of exports of final products, components and parts) of a network pay for imports of parts and components, only four CEEC were in red in 1998. The ratio of export earnings to imports was below 100 percent for Bulgaria and three Baltic economies: Since there is no automotive industry in these countries, this comes as no surprise. Export revenues of other CEEC were several times higher than imports with the exception of Poland when export revenues were roughly equal to import expenditures in 1998. This marked a significant turnaround in comparison to 1997-export earnings covered then 77 percent of the value of imports. Until then Poland seemed to rely mostly on assembling motor vehicles including piston engines from imported parts for domestic consumption rather than for shipments within the respective network. 18 Calculations of 'export' RCA indices for both final products and parts and components and 'import' RCA indices for parts and components shed further light on respective areas of specialization of CEEC in 1998 (Table 15) . They tend to specialize in production of components and parts rather than final products, although they are two exceptions. Slovakia and Slovenia appear to have comparative advantage in production of motor vehicles (SITC. 781) and Slovenia also in production of trucks (SITC. 782). These lines of specialization consist in large part of assembly operations, as the value of 'import' RCA index for parts and components was above unity for both Slovakia and Slovenia. At a more desaggregated level, note that both Slovakia and Slovenia have \"import\" comparative advantage in the same categories of components and parts (marked in bold italic in Table 15 ). Two other countries-Czech Republic and Poland-have comparative advantage in assembly operations, i.e., the values of \"import\" RCA indices were above unity in 1998. Czech Republic imported significant amounts of ignition starting equipment, piston engines and motor vehicle parts while Poland relied on significant imports of piston engines and motor vehicle parts. 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998 Larger number of CEEC has the values of 'import' RCA for components and parts exceeding unity that usually indicates participation in transborder production chains as well as the existence of assembly operations in a country.

Producers are usually too small to conduct directly their sales in foreign markets. They have to become part of a supplier network of a large retail chain and often have to rely on parts supplied by firms designated by a retailer. Furniture producers in CEEC operate as suppliers to large retailers in the EU turning out product according to their specification and very often with provided by them parts.

One suspects that a large portion of these cross border flows relates to assembling operations with some parts destined for the EU for the final assembly and some shipped to CEEC-10 for further processing.

The most dramatic increase occurred in Slovenia with the share of 'furniture network' exports growing from 6 percent in 1993 to 9 percent in 1998. The largest increase occurred in parts with their share in EU-external imports of parts of chairs (82119) growing from 6 percent in 1993 to 50 percent in 1998 with the Czech Republic capturing 19 percent and Slovenia 16 percent of EU imports (Appendix Table   11 ). Yet, it seems that the 'network' analysis combined with a broader discussion of development in trade in parts provides a pretty good yardstick to gauge the significance of trade related to this finer division of labor. The discussed networks combined together cover most of trade in parts between CEEC-10 and the EU. The share of parts covered by these networks in total exports of parts amounted to 61 percent in 1998 and that in total imports of parts from the EU was 58 percent. The share of total networks' trade (total exports and imports of parts and components) in CEEC-10 trade turnover with the EU in manufactures excluding chemicals increased from 12 percent in 1993 to 21 percent in 1998 (Table 20) . The value of both aggregate exports and imports carried out within the networks significantly increased. The share of final products, components and parts in EU-destined exports of manufactures (excluding chemicals) increased from 17 percent in 1993 to 26 percent in 1997 and 31 percent in 1988, and that of imports from 22 to 26 percent in both 1997 and 1998. Their share in EU-external imports almost tripled from 2.7 percent in 1993 to 7.7 percent in 1998, expanding faster than their share in EU imports of manufactures without chemicals, which grew from 4 percent to 7.5 percent over 1993-98.

This share remained stable between 1993 and 1997, and slightly increased on the import side. Note, however, that the value of both exports and imports of parts roughly tripled over this period. Yet this trade remains relatively small rarely exceeding the value of US $20 million. Leaving aside trade in parts within the Czech and Slovak customs union, only trade between Czech firms and those from Hungary and Poland would have passed this threshold.

In Slovak exports to the EU, which increased over 1993-97 from US $73 million to US $500 million, automotive parts (SITC 78) were largely responsible for the increase.

Expansion in these exports as well as in automotive parts (SITC 78) drastically changed the composition of Hungarian exports and to a lesser extent that of Polish exports of parts. Parts for electrical machinery (SITC 77) appear to have driven exports of parts originating in Latvia and Lithuania-in Latvian exports their share increased from 4 to 14 percent and in Lithuanian exports from 16 to 22 percent.The share of aggregate EU-oriented exports and imports of parts in EU-oriented manufactured goods exports and imports may be used as a yardstick to assess country's involvement in production sharing. The share in exports or imports alone would not provide a good indication of the scope of production fragmentation, as the latter involves shipment of parts for further processing in both directions.Table 10provides data on the values of trade in parts as well as their share in trade in manufactures with the EU.On the basis of turnover in parts one may distinguish between three groups of countries according to the intensity of their integration into EU manufacturing operations as measured by the size of trade in parts. The first most integrated group consists of Hungary, Estonia and the Czech Republic. The share of parts in manufactures ranges between 19 and 21 percent",

Hence, different firms may be involved in different stages of processing or they may operate within different networks (Daewoo as opposed to Fiat, for instance). Some may assembly them into a different component used domestically, whereas others may process and ship them back to the EU. Yet, while various combinations of values of RCA indices for exports and imports may occur indicating different layers of involvement in production sharing activity, a double 'revealed comparative advantage' indicates participation in production fragmentation. 4.1. Change in Comparative Advantage: an overview Because of lower wages and opportunities offered by dismantling of central planning, one would expect some assembly operations migrate to CEEC with the CEEC increasing also their specialization in the manufacture of parts. Indeed, this is what appears to have happened. While not a single country seemed to have the revealed comparative advantage in assembling (i.e., RCA on imports) in 1989, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia already acquired it in 1993 (Table 11). By 1997 Poland and Estonia have also become specialized in assembly operations. Simultaneously, the values of RCA indices for manufacturing of parts increased for most CEEC except Bulgaria. If anything, this may suggest their growing integration into EU-based processes of production and marketing.Indeed, the comparison of the pattern of RCA values in CEEC trade with that of countries that have based their industrialization strategy on integrating into production and distribution networks of MNCs suggests strong similarity at least for some CEEC. Note that, as expected, Malaysia and Mexico, economies highly integrated into the economies of their respective partners have RCA above unity in both production and assembling (Mexico's RCA in exports appears to have oscillated around unity). Turkey has comparative advantage in the EU markets in assembling but not in exports. On this count, Turkey appears to be less integrated into the EU production sharing than Estonia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. Again considering geography and levels of economic development this comes as no surprise.",

The Czech profile is most notable for the absence of comparative advantage in office machinery parts and telecommunication equipment parts. Otherwise it covers all major machine-building and transportation equipment parts. Estonia's 'double' RCA power is perhaps most notable for specialization in telecommunication equipment (764). Hungary's profile displays significant diversity, albeit less than that of the Czech Republic. (It shares double comparative advantage in 10 product groups with the Czech Republic.) Hungary is the only CEEC with the double comparative advantage in office machinery parts (759), while Estonia is the only other CEEC with RCA above unity in exports of office machinery parts (759). Slovakia is the only CEEC with a double comparative advantage in motor vehicle parts and accessories (784). RCA profiles of Latvia and Lithuania are similar.' 1 Slovenia and the Czech Republic share double comparative advantage in two categories of furniture parts (82119 and 82199). Second, they all tend to have a large number of product groups with comparative advantage in assembling: Bulgaria -18 product groups, Czech Republic -43, Estonia -17, Hungary -36, Latvia -17, Lithuania -20, Poland -35, Romania -29, Slovakia -30, and Slovenia -26. But specialization in exports of parts varies considerably across CEEC: Bulgaria -9 product groups, Czech Republic -33, Estonia -12, Hungary -20, Latvia -6, Lithuania -3, Poland -17, Romania -12, Slovakia -18, and Slovenia -17. While the number of products with RCA in assembling varies, there is no clear pattern of overlapping specialization across countries. They all share comparative advantage only in assembly operations based on parts of spinning machinery (72449). There are four groups of parts in which nine CEEC have comparative advantage in assembly: tools of special industries (72819) excluding Bulgaria; hand power tool parts (74519) excluding Hungary; parts to non-electric machinery (74999) excluding Estonia; and parts and accessories of telecommunication equipment (764) excluding Slovenia.1 2 Eight CEEC have revealed comparative advantage in parts of other 10 These include parts of steam-generating boilers (all except Slovenia and Lithuania), parts in building electric generators, and rotary electric engines parts, electrical machinery, tools (each 5 countries).",

Note the convergence in change in the composition of trade of manufactures in CEEC-10 and the EU. The composition of both EU-oriented exports from CEEC-10 and imports from the EU has moved considerably toward these of the EU. The share of all products (i.e., final products, components and parts) of discussed networks in CEEC-10 trade in manufactures (excluding chemicals) increased from 20 percent in 1993 to 26 percent in 1997. This share in EU trade was 30 percent in 1993 and 33 percent in 1997. In the case of CEEC-10, however, dramatic increase in exports within networks was responsible for the increase-the share in exports increased from 17 percent to 26 over 1993-97. This seems to suggest that CEEC-10 have entered the same track as the EU in terms of evolving trade patterns within the discussed networks and trade in other parts and components.. However, not all CEECs have. There is a huge difference in the extent to which CEECs have become of this new division of labor driven by fragmentation of production. The difference is between first-tier EU candidates plus Slovakia and countries that were invited to accession negotiations in 1999. The former have obtained high levels of integration into the EU-based networks and experienced a very fast expansion of exports over 1993-98. The latter, excluding Lithuania witnessed the relative contraction of the significance of this trade. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and",

        "text": "Bulgaria, which exports almost 60 percent of parts to partners outside the CEEC-EU region, is an extreme case. In addition to Bulgaria, Lithuania and Romania have EU-shares below Turkey's level of 51 percent. Russia remains a relatively important partner for Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and to a lesser degree for Estonia. Romania exports 8 percent of its parts to NAFTA and East Asia.Taking the EU and CEEC as a single region, which overlaps with a Pan-European Cumulation Area (without Switzerland) does not significantly change the picture. On average, the share of extra-regional exports in CEEC exports of parts amounts to 14 percent. percent of extra-regional imports in total CEEC imports of parts.Viewed in a comparative perspective, the geographic concentration of CEEC trade in parts on EU markets does not strike one as excessive. The combined shares of exports and imports from the EU and CEEC (86 and 78) are similar to the shares of NAFTA in Mexican trade in parts. Moreover, the share of the EU in Mexican trade does not diverge significantly from the share of NAFTA in CEEC trade. On the other hand, however, the geographic pattern of Malaysia is much more diversified, which may be due to its location between East Asia's major markets in Japan and NAFTA. So is Turkey's pattern. NAFTA and East Asia are mainly suppliers (rather than purchasers) of parts not only to CEEC but also to Turkey and Mexico. While NAFTA and East Asia account for 17 percent of all imports of parts by CEEC, they purchase only 4 percent of their exports of parts. But almost 30 percent of Romania's imports are from there. Around one-fifth of Hungarian and Polish imports are from NAFTA and East Asia. On the export side, NAFTA accounts for around 5 percent of Polish and Romanian exports. On the import side, parts from NAFTA account for 14 percent of Romania's import demand-twice as much as for the second country, Bulgaria with the share of 7 percent.The foregoing discussion focusing on values and regional shares in trade in parts and components does not take into account the size of partner country markets. The size is important in any assessments concerning the extent of concentration of trade within the region above the 'normal' level as determined by the region's (or a country's) share of world trade in parts and components. One way to account for it is to do this is to use trade intensities as a measure of trade"

Indeed, without infusion of technology and marketing know how, chances of survival, not to mention expansion, were slim at best. Some others (e.g. Hungary, which only produced buses but not passenger cars) keen to attract FDI responded favorably to foreign firms willing to establish their manufacturing operations (see Box 1). Not all countries, however, followed the path of offering subsidies to large multinationals in the guise of market access restrictions. Baltic states, which did not inherit automobile plants,decided instead to open their markets to cars, while aborted or derailed transition in Bulgaria and Rumania in 1992-96 effectively kept away foreign investors.Restructured automotive industry has become a major player in trade with the EU for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. These five countries accounted in 1998 for 99.6 percent of all exports of motor vehicles from the region and for 97 percent and 95 percent of exports and imports of parts and components respectively.

Exports outpaced the growth in imports: While in 1993 export earnings covered 38 percent of import expenditure of the network, this ratio increased to 63 percent in 1997 and 96 percent in 1998. Exports of parts and components, which increased from U$ 355 million in 1993 to US$ 3.3 billion in 1997 and US$ 4.8 billion in 1998 were mainly responsible for the growing role of the network in generating export eamings. Last but not least, this dramatic change was not the result of import restrictions, as these were subject to commitments to the EU under the European association framework, but triggered by the expansion in exports. Their share in imports of these countries of manufactures from the EU rose slower from 13 percent in 1993 to 16 percent in 1997.Hungary has recorded the most vigorous development indicating a very fast integration into EU-based automotive networks of production and marketing. Although-except for busesit did not have an indigenous passenger car manufacturing industry and production of car parts was negligible before the collapse of central planning, Hungary became in 1988 the largest exporter of automotive network among CEEC and second largest importer of parts and components after Poland. Hungary accounts for 35 percent of CEEC-10 exports of automotive products up from 14 percent in 1993.Its share in EU-external imports of parts tripled from 0.3"
