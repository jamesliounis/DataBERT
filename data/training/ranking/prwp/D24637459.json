Despite the falling costs of distance in recent years, firms still prefer to be located close to one another at a particular locality in order to share the common input markets of labor and intermediate inputs and thus minimize trade and transaction costs. This is referred to as economies of agglomeration, and the literature is generally supportive of this (e.g., Procher, 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Mare and Graham, 2013) . In many developed countries and rapidly growing emerging economies, firm agglomerations and industrial clusters have been established (e.g., Yusuf et al. 2008 ).",

Electricity access is limited to about 30 percent of total population in the region. Many roads, other transport infrastructure, and services are poor in terms of delivery and/or condition. Importantly, unlike general households, firms have more flexibility in choosing their locations, depending on available infrastructure services at each locality. Firms are clearly selective in this regard. Particularly, the literature suggests that transport connectivity is crucial to the locational choices of firms. In Hungary, road availability is found to be a significant determinant of investment (Boudier-Bensebaa, 2005) . Foreign direct investment tends to be concentrated in countries with good transport infrastructure (Cie\u015blik and Ryan, 2004; Milner et al., 2006) . Access to ports is also important for investment decisions (Belderbos and Carree, 2002; Deichmann et al., 2005) .",

Inequality of infrastructure access is significant, and the economic structure varies markedly across regions. While the coastal areas have good access to one of the major regional seaports at Dar es Salaam, the inland areas are more than 1,000 km away from the coast. Dar es Salaam is the primary city with a population of 4.4 million, while the regions around Lake Victoria are agriculturally very fertile. This is clearly posing a challenge to promote industrial clusters, while ensuring a balanced growth path of the whole economy. The paper analyzes how these characteristics affect firms' location decisions.",

This is contributing to a significant improvement in the electricity supply, which has long been a crucial constraint on the economy (IMF 2013). 1 By contrast, agriculture growth remains relatively modest. Tanzania is traditionally a large exporter of coffee, tea and tobacco, but despite high international crop prices, the supply response has been slow.

For instance, firms based in Dar es Salaam have easy access to the port and thus international markets, but the transport cost from Mwanza (1,000 km away) to the port is $150 per ton. From Kigoma, it is about $180 per ton ( Figure 8 ). But these inland areas are much closer to major actual and potential agricultural production areas ( Figure 9 ). Given these infrastructure and economic conditions, firms are, in theory, supposed to decide where to locate. In Tanzania, there are about 45,000 enterprises that are formally registered according to the Central Register of Establishments data in 2010. Firms are currently concentrated in Dar es Salaam and other major cities. The largest firm agglomeration lies in Dar es Salaam, in which 4.4 million people or about 10 percent of total population live, and accounts for about 25 percent of total firms (Table 2) . This is followed by other major regional cities, such as Arusha, Moshi and Mbeya. These secondary agglomerations are located dispersedly in the country (Figure 10 ). The geographic distribution of firms is relatively less skewed in Tanzania than in Kenya (Figure 11 ). In Kenya, nearly 60 percent of total firms are based in Nairobi. In the East African region, the firm distribution is much more even in Rwanda, though the size of the country is different (Figure 12 ). Notably, however, the primary concentration of firms in Dar es Salaam seems to be accelerating. About 2,300 firms were newly created or formally registered in the three districts in Dar es Salaam in 2010 alone. Particularly, other manufacturing sectors than agrobusiness are increasingly concentrated in Dar es Salaam (also see Figure 10 ). The following analysis aims at exploring the possible motivation behind firms' location decisions. ",

Three measurements are considered in this paper: (i) local connectivity, (ii) accessibility to the domestic market, and (iii) accessibility to the global market. Local connectivity is measured by road density at the district level. The domestic market accessibility is measured by the transport cost to the nearest city with more than 100,000 populations. Finally, the proximity to the global market is measured by the transport cost to the port (either Mombasa or Dar es Salaam). See Figure 8 above. 4 In order to instrument these infrastructure variables, two instruments are considered: (i) straight-line distance from each district to the nearest hydropower station, and (ii) straightline distance from each district to the linear proxy rail line between Dar es Salaam and Kigoma.

The results indicate significant agglomeration economies. Thus, it is important to foster firm agglomerations and increase industrial competition.

The IIA assumption requires that preferences between any pair of two choices are independent of the third option. In our context, this means that the relative attractiveness of one location to another is not changed even if the underlying characteristics of the third location are changed. But this is likely to be violated, because the attractiveness of one location is interdependent on all other locations, particularly surrounding ones. Mathematically, 0 the equation in n (e.g., Procher, 2011; Mare and Grahanm, 2013). The spatial interdependence comes from two sources. First, there is often spatial interdependency across locations. While infrastructure is a typical network industry (e.g., roads are connected to each other), agglomeration economies themselves imply spatial interdependency around the neighboring areas. Second, from the empirical point of view, it is likely to have some omitted variables in the model. Spatial autocorrelation lies in \u03bej if there are any unobservable location-specific characteristics.",
