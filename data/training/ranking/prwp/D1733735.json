Most of these reforms have been in the direction of multi-pillar systems, the advantages of which were first articulated by Swiss experts in the early 1960s (Helbling 1991) . Multi-pillar structures have long characterized some of the more advanced OECD countries, especially Switzerland and the Netherlands in Continental Europe and most Anglo-American countries around the world. The World Bank publicized the benefits of multi-pillar pension systems for developing countries in the 1990s both through the publication and dissemination of a policy research report (World Bank 1994) and through its operational work around the world (Holzmann 2000) .",

        "text": "Except for their multi-pillar structure and contrary to some claims (Orszag and Stiglitz 2001 ), the reform programs of different countries are far from identical. They exhibit many differences in the relative importance of different pillars, in the way in which the public and private pillars are organized, and in the way the transition is structured and financed. There are, however, a few basic features that the reform programs share in common. They all involve: a restructuring and downsizing of traditional social security systems that operate as unfunded (or partially funded) public pillars; an expansion in the role of funded private pillars; a willingness to allow large foreign financial institutions to play a central part in the management of accumulated assets, often in joint ventures with large local groups; and creation of a more robust and effective regulatory and supervisory framework. This paper does not re-examine the case for a multi-pillar structure and does not focus on the relative importance of different pillars. The financial pressures caused by demographic aging are often used as an argument for moving from unfunded to funded pension systems. However, demographic aging will also cause financial pressures on funded pillars. Pension contracts are long-term contracts spanning sixty years or more and are by definition intergenerational contracts whether they operate through government agencies or financial markets. The argument in favor of multi-pillar structures that underlies the approach of this paper is the premnise that the evaluation of the merits and demerits of different pension pillars suffers from what may be called \"empirical agnosia\". This concept is different from \"ignorance\", which refers to something that some people know but others do not. The term \"agnosia\" refers to things that no one knows. Given the long span of pension contracts, one would need data covering much more than one hundred years to be able to assess the relative merits of each pillar. The insuperable problem that causes the \"agnosia\" lies in the fact that technology is in a complete state of flux over such long periods. Not only production technology, but also electronic, regulatory, financial and especially medical technology undergoes radical change over such long periods. Thus, in the unlikely event that they became available, long-term data would be very difficult to interpret. \"Empirical agnosia\" suggests that despite any potential costs, diversifying across providers may be a more efficient policy, since it would protect against the effects of a complete failure of one or other of the pillars.",

Financial markets suffer from prolonged, persistent and large deviations from long-term trends and cannot be relied upon as the sole provider of pension benefits. * Third, funded pillars provide benefits that are based on long-term capital accumulation and financial market performance. They need to be privately managed in order to minimize dependence on funded public pillars and avoid government domination of the economy and financial markets. * Fourth, if both public and private pillars are needed, arguing that public pillars have lower administrative costs is of little relevance. What is important is to seek arrangements that minimize the costs of both pillars while promoting higher efficiency. * Fifth, both public and private pillars can be organized in many different forms. The structure of pension systems in different countries reflects local and historical conditions. Local conditions also shape the structure and objectives of pension reform, including the organization and financing of the transition from one system to the next. What may work well in Chile or Mexico may be totally unsuitable for Greece or Slovenia, Egypt or Tunisia. The cost of transition, the demographic structure of a country, the state of development of its financial markets, and the political acceptability of pension reform all are important variables that must be, and are, taken into account in shaping pension reform programs.",

Most of the discussion covers the accumulation phase of pension systems, although some reference is made to the problems that are likely to be faced during the decumulation phase. One of the first questions concerns the need to provide for compulsory participation and offer tax incentives. This is followed by a discussion of different ways in which both compulsory provision and the offer of tax incentives can be structured. The remainder of the paper then focuses on the different ways in which funded pillars can be organized. The paper highlights the differences in approach around the world, belying any claims of uniform solutions (Orszag and Stiglitz 2001) . It also makes a number of practical suggestions regarding the implementation of some policies that would promote retirement saving by encouraging participation in funded pillars and ensuring the safe and efficient management of accumulated assets.",

In fact, the growing number of poorly catered homeless people in most highincome countries, not to mention the large numbers of beggars in poor countries, should cast considerable doubt on the relevance of this argument.

This is perhaps why both social security and occupational pensions 2 have enjoyed a high degree of popularity as long as their promises have been credible and generous. The growing dissatisfaction with social security around the world stems from the fear that the value of benefits will not be sustained. In many developing countries, the existence of widespread evasion undermines the argument that social security is popular. However, widespread evasion may not be the result of unpopularity but rather of faulty design and poor administration.

However, even in these countries, and especially in Singapore, the real rate of return credited to workers' accounts has been very low, despite the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and the attainment of high economic growth with low inflation (Valdes-Prieto 1998). In many countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, the investment performance of central public sector agencies has been disastrous (World Bank 1994) and the quality of service has been very poor. In OECD countries, private pension funds have generally achieved higher investment returns than public pension funds (Davis 1995) , while the quality of service of private funds has also been superior. 14 None of the reforming countries in Latin America has imposed limits on operating fees and on agent commissions. However, a strong case can be made for such limits in mandatory pension systems, especially those offering constrained choice. '5 For a 40-year contribution period, a collection fee of 1 percent of contributions is equivalent to an asset fee of about 5 basis points. This is a useful simplified key, although it should be borne in mind that the relationship between collection and asset fees is nonlinear. For a contribution period that covers the last 30 years before retirement, the simplified key is 7 basis points, while for a contribution period covering the last invest more heavily in corporate equities and bonds (Rocha et al 2001) . The problem with employer funds is that such good performance is found among the pension funds of larger employers that operate the traditional defined-benefit plans.

The first concern relates to the facilitation of what could be called an institutional flight of capital from developing countries with poorly functioning capital markets to high-income countries with strongly developed and efficient markets. One solution to this problem, advocated by Bodie and Merton (2001) , is to use international asset swaps with pension funds based in other countries. In this way, international diversification of pension fund assets would not involve a large outflow of capital. The only movement of capital across the exchanges would cover the net gains or losses suffered by national pension funds in these asset swaps 20 . As '9 The empirical evidence has been compiled by Gregorio Impavido and Alberto Musalem in a series of papers (Catalan et 2001, Impavido and Musalem 2000) . It is important to note that in many countries (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore and Switzerland) foreign pension funds and other international investors may have been as important in stimulating local market development as the domestic pension funds (Vittas 2000) . 20 The fear of institutional capital flight is one of the main reasons for which policymakers in developing regards, the use of derivative products, authorization could be extended on an individual basis to pension funds demonstrating the use of effective systems of asset management and internal control. This approach was formally introduced in Switzerland in 2000, although it was practiced informally over a longer period.",

'8 Tight investment limits on equities and foreign assets should be tolerated in the early years of pension reform, if adoption of conservative policies would overcome opposition to the implementation of pension reform and authorization of private pension funds. However, as a practical rule, investment in domestic equities should be allowed once pension fund assets reach 5 percent of GDP, while international",

Moreover, the result would not be much different from pension funds offering constrained choice of indexed funds. 22 For instance, a pension fund may publicize an investment policy that allocates 60 percent of assets in a broad equity index and 40 percent in a broad bond index. If it were to deviate from this policy and allocate 80 percent in equities and this resulted in a lower return than the publicized allocation it could be required to make up the shortfall in returns.",

However, in the long run, adoptlion of the \"prudent expert\" approach with publication of \"statements of investment policy objectives (SIPOs)\" would be preferable and more efficient. Various guarantees covering aspects such as minimum pension levels and relative investment returns need to be provided to protect workers from aberrant asset managers but care must be taken to address effectively the risk of moral hazard.The paper also argues for greater individual choice, including the creation of a dual regulatory structure. One part would involve heavy regulation with constrained choice of investment funds, limits on operating fees and on account switching, and strong government safeguards and guarantees. This would cater for those workers with low risk tolerance. The other part would be more liberal but based on strong conduct rules. It would offer greater choice of investment funds, allowing multiple accounts and liberal account switching, imposing no limits on operating fees and providing no or fewer state guarantees. This would cater for workers seeking a higher return and willing to tolerate a higher level of risk.The preceding discussion shows that there are many options. Decisions on which options to choose will reflect their political acceptability. Clearly, it is easier for countries to build on what they already have, unless current arrangements are totally deficient and unsustainable. ",

Singapore introduced a minimum-sum annuity requirement in 1988.Pension systems that are based on personal pension plans require either the purchase of life annuities or the use of scheduled withdrawals (also known as income drawdowns in the United Kingdom or allocated annuities in Australia). Scheduled withdrawals, which were an innovation of the Chilean pension reform of 1981, are recalculated annually, taking account of investment returns and the remaining life expectancy of pensioners (and their dependents), but they do not provide longevity insurance. In Chile, and other countries following its lead, lump-sum withdrawals are allowed if the annuity payment exceeds a certain replacement rate (usually 70 percent of reference salary).In designing pension systems a differentiation of compulsory accumulation from compulsory annuitization is advisable. This is because private annuity markets suffer from structural problems and are not well developed even in the most advanced countries'\u00b0. To a large extent, the underdevelopment of annuity markets is due to the crowding out effect of social security and occupational pensions that predominate in advanced countries. Pending the development of more efficient annuity markets, it would be preferable to limit compulsory annuitization to a level of around 35 percent of average earnings and subject any excess balances to scheduled withdrawals, but with flexible arrangements for major health and other emergencies(Blake et al 2000, James andVittas 2000). The development of variable annuities with floors and caps as well as the use of more transparent participating annuities could address some of the problems facing annuity markets. The 35 percent target should apply to the combined pension from the unfunded public pillar and the private funded one. Thus, workers should be encouraged to accumulate enough retirement savings to support a replacement rate of around 70 percent of pre-retirement income, but only half of that should be required to be annuitized."

        "text": "Supporters of centralized public management point to the lower marketing and operating costs of public agencies and argue that the lower investment returns of past experience were due to failure to ensure the insulation of fund management from political interference. Several countries, including Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden, have created in recent years public pension funds with better incentives to attain higher investment returns and strong safeguards for insulation from political interference. However, in all cases, the public pension funds represent a fraction (in some cases very small) of total pension fund assets under management. Moreover, the new investment rules for such public funds have yet to pass a test of political interference. Proponents of an effective nationalization of pension fund management(Orszag and Stiglitz 2001, Heller 1998)  underestimate the implications of a vast public agency not only for political interference in corporate governance and performance but also for the functioning and innovation record of financial markets.The choice between closed and open funds is a more delicate one. A weakness of openfunds, such as those found in Chile, Argentina and other Latin American countries, is their high level of operating fees. This is mainly due to high selling commissions and other marketing costs and is related to the right given to workers to switch their accounts among competing pension fund management companies. Employer-based pension funds have much lower operating costs, mainly because they avoid these marketing costs(Rocha et al 2001).It should, however, be stressed that the level of operating fees of Latin American open funds tends to be exaggerated. This is because operating fees are levied in the form of collection fees and these translate into very high asset fees during the first years of operation of open funds' 3 . Calculated over the whole active career of workers, the fees of open funds in Chile and several other Latin American countries are much lower and correspond to between 70 and 150 basis points of assets under management(James et al 1999). These fees compare favorably with those charged by most mutual funds in the United States and other countries but are higher than the operating costs of employer-based closed funds(Rocha et al 2001).The operating fees charged by open funds in Latin American countries may come down as the systems mature and regulatory measures are taken to reduce their marketing intensity (limits on account switching, allowing multiple accounts and multiple funds, etc.)\" 4 . Such a trend is already evident in Chile, where operating fees have declined substantially over the years. They amounted in 2000 to a collection fee of 13.9 percent of contributions, equivalent to an average asset fee of less than 70 basis points for a 40-year active contribution period' 5 . Moreover, what really matters is the net investment return after deducting operating fees. On this score the Chilean and other Latin American pension funds have achieved, and continue to report, very high net real rates of return.Employer-based closed funds tend, in general, to have lower operating costs as well as high investment returns, especially in Anglo-American countries where they have tended to '3 Operating fees may take several different forms. Collection fees are based on contributions and a,re similar to the front load fees charged by most mutual funds. Asset fees are levied on account balances. Performance fees are calculated on investment returns in excess of a stipulated level. Exit fees are charged when workers switch out of a fund. Benefit fees are levied on pension payments. In Chile and most Latin American countries, only collection and benefit fees are allowed. Mexico has permnitted all types of fees, but collection fees predominate."
