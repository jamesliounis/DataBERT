  "abstract": "Financial market instability has been the focus of attention of both academic and policy circles. Rating agencies have been under particular scrutiny lately as promoters of financial excesses, upgrading countries in good times and downgrading them in bad times. Using a panel of emerging economies, this paper examines whether sovereign ratings affect financial markets. We find that changes in sovereign ratings have an impact on country risk and stock returns. We also find that these changes are transmitted across countries, with neighbor-country effects being more significant. Rating upgrades (downgrades) tend to occur following market rallies (downturns). Countries with more vulnerable economies, as measured by low ratings, are more sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates.",

Naturally, following the series of currency crashes in the 1990s, most of the discussion has centered on currency crises. The latest crisis in Turkey in February 2001 will certainly contribute to keeping an avid interest in the triggers of crises well into the new millennium. But currency collapses are not the only ones to have attracted attention. The daily volatility of stock and bond markets in non-crisis times have also stirred interest, with, for example, the vagaries of the NASDAQ index in the United States making the daily headlines of newspapers around the globe.",

When a credit rating agency downgrades sovereign debt of a country, all debt instruments from that country might have to be downgraded accordingly because of the sovereign ceiling doctrine. As a result, commercial banks in the country that turn out to be rated as sub-investment grade can no longer issue internationally recognized countries and find that news regarding the creditworthiness of a sovereign borrower affects other countries' stock and bond markets.",

        "text": "Neither has previous research examined whether economic vulnerability may trigger a large reaction of domestic financial markets to international events. For example, hikes in world interest rates may affect more drastically countries with economies in distress (with banking fragilities, liquidity problems due to high concentration of short-term debt, or near insolvency) than countries with healthier economies. 3 This \"vulnerability\" effect may, in fact, explain some conflicting results in the empirical literature that examines international transmission of shocks. For example, Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Kamin and von Kleist (1999) find that U.S. interest rate shocks do not affect sovereign bond spreads, while Herrera and Perry (2000) find that they do. Interestingly, the Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Kamin and von Kleist (1999) studies include data only up to 1997 (before the crises) while the Herrera and letters of credit for domestic exporters and importers, isolating the country from international capital markets. Similarly, corporations will not be able to issue debt in international capital markets. 2 The word contagion here is used in a broad sense to denote cross-country spillover effects, regardless of the nature of the shock. For alternative definitions and related papers see www.worldbank.org/contagion. 3 On a similar vein, Frankel, Schmukler, and Serven (2000) study the transmission of international interest rates to countries with different exchange rate regimes. Perry (2000) sample includes observations on the crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil, and thus comprises episodes with very fragile economies. This paper complements the previous research on rating agencies by also examining these possible cross-country and security-market spillover-effects of rating changes. It also contributes to the literature on contagion and international transmission of shocks by examining the effect of domestic vulnerability, as measured by the ratings of international agencies, on the extent of international spillovers. Our results can be summarized as follows.",

While examining the determinants of this time-varying relationship is beyond the scope of this paper, we will now examine whether hikes in interest rates in financial centers are transmitted more strongly to vulnerable economies. We divide the sample into two equal parts according to the country ratings. The results indicate that vulnerable economies are more strongly affected by the vagaries of international financial markets than healthier economies. The effect is about 50 percent higher. Table 5 reports similar estimations for stock market returns. The results are less strong than in the case of sovereign debt. This is not unexpected since assessments on sovereign risk should affect more closely yields on sovereign debt rather than stock returns. Still, stock returns seem to react more strongly to fluctuations in interest rates in financial centers when the economy tends to be more fragile, as captured by low ratings from credit agencies.",

To capture whether credit ratings have a persistent effect on the mood of investors, we rely on event-study methods commonly used in the finance literature. The event-study methodology also allows us to examine the claim that rating agencies behave procyclically, upgrading countries in good states and downgrading them in times of crises. Thus, we examine the behavior of asset markets around the time of the rating changes (+/-10 day-windows). Standard event study methodology requires linking rating events to abnormal returns. That is why we base the event study on the yield spreads between sovereign government debt and the benchmark instruments from industrial countries. In the case of stocks, we use the dollar \"stock spreads\" between emerging markets stock prices and the S&P500 U.S. stock market index. With respect to the behavior of markets in the days leading to the rating changes, the evidence seem to support the hypothesis that rating agencies may have contributed to amplify the boom-bust pattern in emerging markets. Overall upgrades occur when markets are rallying and downgrades when emerging markets are collapsing. This effect seems to be stronger in the case of downgrades. For example, bond spreads increase up to 9 percent in the 10-days prior to downgrades. Similarly, the stock market spreads decline up to 7 percent. Naturally, these fluctuations could reflect an anticipation effect.",

On the contrary, spreads continue to increase by at least 2 percent. The effects are somewhat stronger when we examine downgrades of foreign-currency denominated bonds only. Spreads widened an extra 5 percent. In contrast, the effects of upgrades seem to be long lasting in the stock market, with domestic stock markets gaining an extra 2 percent return relative to that of the stock index in the United States. This is not the case for downgrades. spreads, while the bottom one uses stock spreads.

Most of the previous research has focused on quantifying the effects of changes in ratings of a country on sovereign risk as measured by the yield spread of domestic instruments relative to developed country benchmark instruments. In this paper, not only did we expand this exercise with updated data, but also we tested new hypotheses to have a more complete characterization on the effects of sovereign rating changes. We found that rating changes have effects both on the instruments being rated and on other instruments within the same country. We found that sovereign ratings have a significant impact on stock returns. We also examined whether ratings of other countries' sovereign debt have the potential to trigger contagion in financial markets. We found that rating changes have spillover effects to other countries.",

One important restriction in all these studies is that country risk obeys a common linear specification. One possibility is that interest rate hikes may have more damaging effects in countries near insolvency or with very fragile economies. We investigated this possibility and examined whether countries with lower ratings are affected more severely by changes in U.S. interest rates. We found that countries with more vulnerable economies are affected 50 percent more by fluctuations of interest rates in the rest of the world. While our results help to understand better the movements of financial markets in emerging economies, we are far from explaining daily volatility.

The coefficient for the changes in ratings (domestic and foreign) is negative and statistically significant, although small when compared to the average daily change in spreads. In days of rating changes, spreads only change by about 0.5 percent while the average absolute change of spreads in our sample is about 2 percent.The second column examines separately whether changes in domestic ratings have different effects from changes in ratings of foreign countries. Interestingly, we now find that changes in ratings of domestic debt not only have a statistically significant effect, but this effect is also economically important, with rating changes leading to changes in the spreads of about 2.5 percent. Foreign ratings also matter, but their effect is substantially smaller averaging about 0.4 percent over the sample. Our sample on ratings includes ratings on foreign-currency debt and domestic-currency debt. The first rating captures sovereign risk while the second also makes an assessment of devaluation risk. Since we are examining sovereign yield spreads, ratings on domestic-currency debt should not affect yield spreads once controlled for ratings directly related to country risk.",
