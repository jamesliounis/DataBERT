Buiter (1983) goes into some detail in presenting a set of stylized accounts that corresponds to an estimate of the comprehensive net wealth or permanent income accounts for the public sector. From these accounts he derives the government budget constraint. He essentially extends the permanent income hypothesis to the public sector. 7 Buiter argues that in a first best world not only private agents, but governments and international organizations as well, would decide on spending, saving, lending, production and portfolio allocation constrained only by comprehensive wealth or permanent income.",

Changes in export tax revenue were also the result of changes in the tax rate (it was especially high in the early 1970s). These factors explain the slight changes in the composition of revenue during these years. The collapse in export duties seems to be the result of several factors. A general collapse of economic conditions meant that more people were turning away from commercial activity into subsistence. An overvalued cedi combined with a decline in cocoa production meant reduced exports and hence, reduced receipts from export taxes (and reduced receipts due to lower import levels). This was compounded by the growth of black market cocoa exports and of the parallel market in general which is not subject to taxation. (see Rimuer (1989) and May (1985) ",

This may result from the fact that an increase in the real exchange rate would assist exports thereby improving access to the foreign exchange necessary to import. To the extent that the ability to export increases the ability to import, a depreciation in the currency could lead to a rise in revenue from import duties. A depreciation also raises import tax revenue by increasing the domestic value of imports. An increase in the terms of trade (defined here as the unit value of exports over the unit value of imports) was also found to increase import duties.

In the heavily controlled Ghanaian economy, these high rates of inflation resulted in negative real interest rates and, because of the fixed nominal exchange rate, in overvaluation of the currency. These in turn implied implicit taxes on financial intermediation and reduced incentives for exports.

When exchange markets are officially rationed this can lead to high premia in parallel foreign exchange markets. He provides an estimate for the inflation tax maximizing rate of inflation in Ghana and finds that the in the past the prevailing rates of inflation in Ghana were higher than this optimum or maximizing rate. A paper by Chhibber and Shafik (1988) looks at the inflationary consequences of exchange rate devaluation in the presence of 113 parallel markets for foreign currency. May(1984) provides a theoretical framework to examine the way in which exchange controls and black markets for foreign exchange are related to lobbying for import licenses and to smuggling activities. He also develops a methodology based on a paper by Tanzi (1982) , to assess the importance and magnitude of the parallel market economy in Ghana. He shows how the incentive to smuggle is related to the black market premium: smuggling will only occur if the import premium outweighs the black market premium. Azam and Besley (1989) present a simple general equilibrium model determining both the parallel mairket exchange rate and the price of consumer goods, with particular application to Ghana.",

While this may be true, any analysis based on historical data and evidence that ignored the dual foreign exchange markets would not present a true picture of the economy.

The issues surrounding fiscal deficits are certainly not new, but the economic developments of the past decade have led to renewed interest in fiscal themes. In the developed countries, the growth of the U.S. federal deficit provided the impetus for a reassessment of the effect of fiscal deficits on economic activities. In the developing countries, fiscal policy, particularly the reduction of fiscal deficits, has been one of the cornerstones of short-term stabilization and medium-term adjustment programs. The macroeconomic theory concerning fiscal deficits has undergone a considerable transformation since Keynes emphasized fiscal policy in his General Theory. Rational expectations and the proposition of Ricardian equivalence put the effectiveness of traditional demand ranagement policies into question. Much of the discussion over fiscal policy in the past fifteen years has addressed the question of whether fiscal deficits and the way in which they are financed will have an effect on economic activity. While the theoretical debate continues, in practice fiscal deficits continue to be an important issue. In developing countries in particular, economic programmes in recent years have emphasized demand reduction via reductions in fiscal deficits. The underlying assumption is that fiscal deficits will have an effect on demand. The idea that fiscal deficits are something that can be measured and managed is implicit in that assumption, yet as experience in both developed and developing countries shows, deficits may not be so easy to measure nor to control. This study presents an empirical investigation of fiscal deficits in Ghana and assesses their effect on the financial and real side of the economy. The case of Ghana is interesting because of the major role that fiscal deficits have played in her economic history. At the moment of independence Ghana was perceived to be at the forefront of the African countries. Her population was well educated and economic infrastructure was strong. Under Nkrumah, the first government led a statist economy that emphasized public investment and public spending as the road to economic growth.",

One reason is that data on the state-owned enterprises, which constitute a sizable portion of the industrial sector, are not available until 1984, and even then they are not complete. Another difficulty is that some of the accounts of public sector institutions are kept on a fiscal year basis while others are kept on a calendar year basis. a) The consolidated public sector deficit With these difficulties kept in mind one can at least gain an idea of the order of magnitude of the fiscal deficit by taking into consideration the data that are available.",

The difficulty in including these losses into the public sector deficit is that accounting practices vary widely between the central bank and the central government. It is clear that in Ghana the central bank has incurred substantial losses. One recent report stated that the accumulated valuation adjustments on net foreign liabilities reached 0243 billion by end-June 1989, equivalent to more than three and a half times the net domestic credit of the banking system as a whole and over 20 percent of the GDP 26 .

The line marked with crosses represents the combined domestic and external flows to the public sector. (Therefore the area between the two lines represents external borrowing.) The fiscal deficit as determined by public sector borrowing is roughly 2 percent of GDP in 1971. It rises sharply, reaching 10 percent of GDP in 1973 due to a large jump in external borrowing over 1972 and 1973. Public sector borrowing drops off in 1974 and 1975 only to jump to just 15 percent of GDP in 1976, 1977 and, 1978. This high level of borrowing is all the more remarkable given the lack of external \u00b1..^ sce. The deficit falls again to 5 percent of GDP in 1979. Three more peaks follow in 1980, 1982, and 1986 with public sector borrowing reaching 7.5, 9.7 and 10.24 percent of GDP respectively. In 1987, total public sector borrowing declined to 9.5 percent of GDP and in 1988 it dropped sharply, reaching a surplus of 0.38 percent of GDP.\"In general the figures given here are considerably larger than those provided by aggregating the public sector accounts.There are two principal reasons for this.

The project aid and other such financing are included in this measure of the deficit. This becomes particularly important after the implementation of the Economic Recovery Programme in 1984. The second reason that the finance-based estimate is larger is that it includes information on the borrowing requirements of the public enterprises, which was not complete in the government accounts. In the case of Ghana, determining the public sector deficit from the financing side seems to provide a more comprehensive estimate than using the conventional methr I where the various levels of the public sector are consolidated. There are, however, some caveats to using this measure. In particular, while in principal the differencing of the stock measures should give us an accurate measure of net flows, in practice this may not always be the case. In the World Debt Tables, for example, the differencing of the total stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt does not give us figures equal to the net flows of public and publicly guaranteed debt as listed in the Debt",

In Ghana, the negative real interest rates in the formal financial system, combined with strict credit allocation, encouraged the development of an extensive network of informal credit markets. Financial disintermediation was also encouraged by a currency conversion in 1979, whereby a proportion of the currency holdings in private hands was expropriated and by demonetization of the largest currency notes (50 cedi) in 1982.In addition to leading to negative interest rates, the inflation that was at least partly engendered by reliance on money creation for financing the deficit led to overvaluation of the official exchange rate, given the fixed nominal rate.This overvaluation, not only affected Ghana's trade performance, but increased the premium on parallel market activity (defined as the black market exchange rate over the official exchange rate) and lead to increased activity in the parallel markets.May (1985) estimated that parallel market activity reached 32.41 percent of the official market GDP in1982.35  Increased black market activity resulting from inflation also eroded the tax base (particularly from cocoa)",

Reduced exports implied less foreign exchange for the financing of imports and hence, a reduction of revenue from import duties. Lower economic activity resulting from lack of imported inputs also implied lower sales and excise taxes. To sum up, prior to 1984 Ghana was constrained to finance her fiscal deficits domestically. For the most part, the deficits were financed by money creation. This was particularly the case in 1977 and 1978. Extensive reliance on this method of finance implied an increase in the money supply and a sizable increase in the rate of inflation. After this period the effects of domestic financing on inflation become less clear but still seem to contribute to high inflation rates up until 1984. In this year the government substituted external finance for domestic finance , and to the extent that the increase in net foreign assets was monetized it also has had inflationary consequences. In the heavily controlled Ghanaian economy, the resulting inflation made real interest rates negative thus inhibiting financial intermediation. It also led to overvaluation of the currency and an increase in the black market premium. Both negative real interest rates and the overvalued currency contributed to increased incentives to operate in the parallel markets. 2) Inflation, the Demand for Assets. and Beignorage This section considers how inflation in Ghana affects the demand for both money and quasi-money and in turn, how these demands affect seignorage revenues. A simple model is used to consider the effect on seignorage revenue of a lower rate of inflation.

Changesin seignorage respond to changes in inflation with a one period lag. For example, inflation based on the GDP deflator rose by almost 10 percent from 1977 to 1978, but seignorage revenue increased by a little over two percent over the same year. Seignorage then dropped about 3.5 percent in the next period although inflation was declining from 1978 to 1979. Over the period, we see a gradual decline in the amount of seignorage revenue to about 3 percent of GDP with two pronouncied drops in seignorage revenue in 1982 and 1985. Despite high rates of inflation in the early eighties, seignorage revenue did not reach the levels that it had obtained during the mid-late seventies. The reflects the longrun effects of inflation (and government demonetization policies) on money demand. As high levels of inflation and uncertainty persisted, money demand declined and seignorage revenues remained at about three percent despite the increased rate of inflation. This is illustrated by our second scenario in which the inflation rAte is kept at 20 percent. Such a reduction in the inflation rate might be induced by reducing government expenditures in order to lower the deficit that needs to be financed via money creation. Another possibility is that development of domestic financial markets or improvement in access to external finance might reduce the government's reliance on money creation as a source of finance. We see from figure 3.4, that while seignorage revenue is lower when the inflation rate is kept at twenty percent, periods of high inflation do not provide proportionate increases in seignorage revenue. Seignorage revenue during the late seventies is only about 1.5 percent of GDP more than it would have been had the inflation rate been maintained at 20 percent. Moreover, the long-run effect on money demand results in little gain in seignorage in the 1980's. In 1984 we see that seignorage revenue at the inflation rate of twenty percent would have exceeded seignorage revenue at the actual inflation rate of about 40 percent. In the period after 1984, the gain in seignorage over that which would have been received with inflation at 20 percent is negligible. The accumulated effect of inflation on money demand contributed to reduced seignorage over time. The disproportionate increase in seignorage revenue for increases the rate of inflation is confirmed by Figure 3.5. This figure sets out the seignorage revenue received for given inflation rates, based on our model. It shows a Laffer curve effect: that beyond a certain inflation rate (about 125 % for Ghana) seignorage as a function of GDP begins to decline.",

Another important factor was the deterioration in Ghata' s terms of trade which was 47% between 1973 and 1983.

The first part of this paper lays out the model focusing on exporters' and importers' maximization problems and the financing of the public sector budget. The second part of the paper solves for the determinants of the black market premium.The premium is found to depend on the levels of government expenditure and tax revenues among other things.From this analysis we derive an expression for the trade balance and for the real exchange rate in terms of the black market premium and therefore in terms of government expenditure and 114 revenues. The third part is an application of the theoretical analysis to Ghana. The fourth part concludes.1.) The ModelIn this paper, as inPinto (1985)  the government purchases foreAgn exchange from exporters at a fixed rate of e cedis/dollar and sells part of its foreign exchange to importers at rate e. The remainder of the foreign exchange is used to finance government consumption. With a black market foreign exchange rate of b cedis/dollar, the marginal cost of foreign exchange is b; note however, that the government obtains foreign exchange at rate e. Thus the official exchange rate, e, acts as a conduit for real income transfers between the government and the private sector. When the government is a net seller of foreign exchange then the black market premium acts as a source of revenue for the government. When the government is a net purchaser of foreign exchange then real income is transferred to the private sector from the government.49 The system of exchange rates above acts as an implicit tax on exporters who must sell foreign exchange earned from exporting abroad to the government at less than its marginal cost. This implies that there is a conflict between the goals of encouraging exports and raising revenues to finance government expenditures. If the implicit tax on exports is lowered (the official exchange rate is devalued so that it equals the marginal cost of foreign exchange) then total exports will increase. The government is assumed to get revenues from the inflation tax as well as from conventional taxes and foreign aid. The inflation tax finances the residual requirements of the government net of the implicit tax on exports and net of conventional taxes and foreign aid. In this formulation, an increase in public sector expenditure raises the reliance on the inflation tax. We assume that the inflation tax is given by wm where: e N = nominal money balances, and X = the rate of inflation. At the steady state the rate of inflation equals the official rate of depreciation of the currency. The government' s budget constraint, at the steady state is shown in equation (1) below: (1) (gT-t-A) -m Ae/e, where gT = total government expenditure in dollars which is fixed and which equals P. gm/e + cl qggovernment expenditure on nontradables Pmthe price of nontradables g,government expenditure on importables capital controls and restrictions on commercial transactions.

This is because an increase in the premium represents an increase in the implicit tax on exports; as the tax rises agents substitute labor towards the production of nontradables. An increase in government spending on importables lowers the supply of labor to the nontradable sector. There are two reasons for this: an increase in government spending on importables in this model must be met by a decrease in government consumption of nontradables thus reducing the total demand for nontradables. Also, if government spending on importables increases then, given the trade balance, either exports must increase or imports must fall or both. Both these effects tend to reduce the allocation of labor to the nontradable sector. Production of exports must increase at the cost of nontradable production. An increase in the trade surplus will reduce the allocation of labor to the nontradable sector. An increase in the trade surplus implies a reduction in domestic absorption or an increase in the production of tradables both of which will tend to reduce nontradable production and therefore the allocation of labor to the nontradable sector. An increase in the terms of trade has ambiguous effects on the labor allocated to the nontradable sector. On the one hand, it raises the return to the production of tradables, while, on the other hand, it lowers the relative price of importables and therefore also raises the net return in the production of nontradables. An increase in the black market premium raises the marginal cost of foreign exchange and therefore the cost of imports. Thus imports fall as the premium rises. An increase in the terms of trade lowers the relative price of importables and therefore agents import more given the trade balance. An increase in the trade surplus, ceteris paribus, implies a reduction in imports.

This is because an increase in the premium raises the returns from exporting in the black market. At the same time however, nontradable production falls (since imports become more expensive). This tends to raise the price of nontradables. The net effect on the black market relative price of exportables to nontradables may be either negative or positive. An increase in government consumption of tradables, an increase in the terms of trade and an increase in the trade surplus are all expected to have similar effects on the black market real exchange rate as on the official exchange rate, given the premium. When we substitute in for the steady state determinants of the black market premium, we may write the steady state official real exchange rate as a function of the terms of trade, the official rate of depreciation, aid flows to Ghana, tax revenues, and government spending. The effect of an increase in government spending on the real exchange rate is negative. An increase in spending has a negative effect on the real exchange rate through two channels: an increase in spending that represents partly an increase in spending on nontradables will raise the relative price of nontradables. An increase in government spending will also raise the black market premium. This will again tend to make imported inputs more expensive and therefore raise the price of nontradables which use these inputs. 132 An increase in the price of exports, Px will raise (depreciate) the real exchange rate. A higher relative price for exports implies a larger supply of foreign exchange premium, given government spending, and therefore a lower price for foreign exchange. As explained previously, as the premium falls the real exchange rate will depreciate. An increase in tax revenues will tend to depreciate the real exchange rate. Higher tax revenues will lower the black market premium and therefore lower the price of nontradables. The effect of an increase in the rate of depreciation (and inflation) on the real exchange rate is ambiguous since the effect on the premium is ambiguous. If 60/16< 0 i.e. if the inflation elasticity of the demand for money in wealth is less than unity then the real exchange rate would rise (depreciate) with an increase in the rate of depreciation.5 An increase in aid flows is expected to depreciate the real official exchange rate. This is because, in our model, an increase in aid flows to Ghana represents an increase in net resources available to the government and therefore reduces the government's reliance on money financing.

An improv.4itent in the terms of trade, given F, the trade balance, will have an ambiguous effect on the black market premium. On one hand, it will tend to raise the production of tradables relative to nontradables. On the other hand, by raising wages, it will induce substitution towards imported inputs and away from labor in the nontradable sector: thus imports rise. This may put upward pressure on the black market premium depending on the relative short run responses of exports and imports given the trade balance. An improvement in the trade balance is accompanied by a lower premium. This is because an improvement in the trade balance implies a larger supply of foreign exchange in the black market. The trade balance equation can be rewritten in terms of the stock of money, the stock of foreign currency held by private agents, the terms of trade, and public sector expenditure. This is done by substituting out for the black market premium in equation (18) below: . . (18) F -F(Px, m, F, Z, gZ) The trade balance depends positively on the terms of trade. This is because an increase in the terms of trade raises export revenues at every level of exports, and also raises the production of tradables by inducing agents to substitute away from nontradable to tradable production. An increase in the stock of money could have either a negative effect or pop :ive effect on the trade balance. Firstly, a higher stock of money implies greater wealth for the private sector and therefore greater consumption demand (for nontradables). This will put upward pressure on the relative price of nontradables and agents will substitute production towards nontradables. Since imports are used in nontradable production imports must rise and the trade balance tends to deteriorate. On the other hand, an increase in the stock of money held by the private sector, given the trade balance, is associated with a higher black market premium. The higher premium reduces imports (and exports, but less so) and improves the trade balance.\" This makes sense if we recall that the overall trade balance reduces to the unofficial trade balance since, by construction, the official 136 sector is always in balance.

As discussed before, one-shot devaluation is expected to reduce the premium temporarily by lowering the real money stock instantaneously. Thus we should expect to see a drop in the black market premium (which we did). For the following years the exchange rate regime did not change significantly-there were a number of discrete devaluations from 1983 to 1987, tax collection methods improved and aid flows to Ghana started to rise. In this way the government gradually switched to alternative means of financing of a lowering level of government expenditure.6 All these events would, in this model, lower the 'fHigher aid flows means lower money financing and therefore a lower steady state premium.black market premium.

In view of the fact that the fiscal deficit has been falling, and the reliance on money financing has been falling, there was not a substantial differential between the black market and official exchange rates.

The negative effect in turn implied reductions in the level of seignorage available to the government. Given the government's dependence on monetary finance the reduction in seignorage implied yet greater levels of money creation thus feeding into fuzther inflation. Government attempts to reduce inflation by demonetization also had the effect of reducing money demand in the longer run and hence, reducing seignorage revenue. These actions are also likely to have seriously weakened the domestic financial system thus making it even mtcre difficult for the government to finance its deficits via borrowing in domestic markets. The effects of fiscal deficits on consumption are somewhat harder to pin down. The principal conclusion to be drawn from the estimation of the consumption function is that neither the pure Keynesian theory nor the pure Ricardian theory are validated. Our first estimation, incorporating a number of fiscal variables suffered from collinearity and the number of variables is probably too great to provide reliable estimates.",

The significance of disposable income indicates that liquidity constraints affect consumption decisions. Numerous fiscal variables were tested as set out in the research proposal, but none were found to be significant.6.)  Private investment was found to be negatively affected by public investment, thus indicating that some crowding-out did occur in Ghana. Private investment is also positively influenced by a relaxation of credit constraints and by corporate tax revenues. (This suggests t.-.at corporate tax revenues might be highly correlated with corporate profits.)The real interest rate was not found to have a significant influence on private investment. Public expenditure has had a significant impact on the official real exchange rate, the trade balance, and on the black market premium. Increased public expenditure was found to have a negative effect on the trade balance. It was also found to have a negative effect on the official exchange rate (higher public expenditures tended to appreciate the real exchange rate). The empirical results also show that a rising public sector deficit along with stringent restrictions on foreign exchange transactions lead to a very high black market premium.8 XI. MEASURING THE DEFICIT Implicit in the notion of targeting the fiscal surplus or deficit 3 is the idea that one is able to obtain a reasonable measure of the deficit. This is not necessarily as straightforward as it might seem. Keynesian theory initially vtewed the deficit as exogenous. It soon became clear that the deficit was actually endogenous, given talat tax revenres and government expenditures are partly determined by the level of economic activity. Various r7easures of the deficit have heen developed to adjust for cyclical movements in the economy and to incorporate the effects of certain macroeconomic variables (particularly inflation). As ir normally the case, the most appropriate measure of the deficit depends upon the purpose of the analysis. Tanxi and Blejer (1984) discuss what they call the \"conventional deficit\" with reference to the definition set out in the International Monetary Fund's \"Draft Manual on Government Finance Statistics\". This measure arranges the payments and receipts of the government sector accounts as follows: Fiscal Deficit -(Revenue + Grant,' -(Expenditure on Goods and Services + Transfer Payments + Net Borrowing + Net Decrease in Cash Uloldings -Amortization This approach does have its shortcomings. First, the definition emphasizes cash flow concepts rather than accrual concepts of accounting. At times, the cash flow concept may not fully reflect underlying trends. For instance, if a government purchases goods and services and delays payment (builds up arrears), the cash concept may not reveal in the current year that the level of spending has changed. Tanzi and Blejer point out that while capturing the monetary impact of the budget, the cash concept may not capture the incomereating (i.e., the Keynesian) impact. Thay note that in the heyday of Keynesian economics (the mid-sixties), the accrual concept was generally preferred to the cash concept. The classification of grants as a revenue source rather than as a financing item is also a practice that is questionable. Grants are not usually permanent sources of income and therefore may fluctuate. (In Ghana they have fluctuated dramatically over the years.) Unless grants are a guaranteed source of revenue, it might be advisable to classify them as a financing item. Similar questions may be raised as to whether net lending should be included as part of the public sector's deficit. If the net lending is extended to the private sector then it does not necessarily reflect public sector usa of resources, but rather, it reflects the public sector's role as a financial intermediary. If the net lending is extended to the public sector (say from the central government to a state-owned enterprise) then it does imply a public sector claim on resources, in which case net lending probably should be included on the expenditure side. In practice, in many developing countries at least, lending between the various levels of the public sector is often not repaid and thus effectively becomes a net transfer. Tanzi and Blejer note a final issue concerning this measure of the deficit. When inflation is significant it may be difficult to distinguish in an economic sense between amortization payments and interest payments. As all interest payments are considered as an expenditure item and no allowance is made for the repayment element implicitly included in the interest payment, the size of the deficit may be overstated. The World Bank's \"World Development Report 1988\" discusses different measures of the deficit.4 It first cites the Rublic sector borrowinga reuirement (PSBR) as a useful indicator of the public sector's net use of financial resources. The PSBR represents the total excess of expenditure over revenue for all government entities, all of which must be financed by new borrowing net of repayment of previous debt.",

In the first years of the seventies debt held by the monetary authorities was relatively small, even negligible in 1973. It increased to 3.25 percent of GDP in 1974 (presumably to pay back the debts owed to the commercial In at least half of the years considered, the financing provided by the central bank to the central government was greater than all other domestic financins sources combined. Over the same period, the stateowned enterprises also depended on the central bank for financing.The other notable source of finance for the central government is the Social Security Fund. As mentioned in part II, the Social Security Fund was until recently required to invest its surpluses (which in many years were considerable) in government stocks. Thus the Social Security Fund was a captive source of finance.The reliance on borrowing from the commercial banks has generally been low, with a peak of 2.02 percent of GDP in 1977. Borrowing from the secondary banks has also been fairly low, ranging between -0.58 and .59 percent of GDP. As can be seen fromTable 3.1, in more recent years the government has actually been paying off its debt to the central bank and to the secondary banks. Borrowing from the private sector and from public enterprises has not been a significant source of finance for the government.From 1985 onward, domestic borrowing falls relative to the rest of the period. The rise in external borrowing during this period suggests that with the onset of the structural adjustment program the government has been able to substitute external finance for domestic finance. The overall picture is thus one where the government relied heavily on borrowing from the central bank to finance its deficits until 1985, when it obtained the option of substituting foreign borrowing for domestic borrowing. To the extent that borrowing from the central bank led to an increase in the supply of money balances that surpassed the increase in demand for money balances, such borrowing implies inflationary consequences. Fiqure 3.1 the GDP deflator and CPI inflation rates are set out. The two indices more or less follow the same pattern with three price shocks coming in 1977, 1981, and 1983. If we compare these inflation rates with Figure 2.3 of public sector deficits defined from the financing side, and with the data on the government's sources of financing, the relationship between the reliance on money creation in the mid-late seventies and high levels of inflation seems fairly Thereafter the reliance on borrowing from the central bank declines, and in 1987 and 1988 the government pays back some of its debt to the central bank.The inflation that results from money creation (and from other sources) affects other areas in the economy. In Ghana interest rates have been controlled until very recently. The high inflation rates that Ghana experienced over the period",

Fiscal Deficits and Consumptioa There has been a great deal of theoretical debate over the years concerning the effect of fiscal deficits on private consumption. The Keynesian tradition holds that current consumption is determined by current disposable income e.g. present income minus taxes. The permanent income hypothesis suggests that current consumption is determined by the present value of future income which implies that both present and future tax levels will affect current consumption. More recently the debate has focused on the validity of the Ricardian equivalence approach which argues that, under certain conditions, private consumption determination will not be affected by the way in which the government chooses to finance its deficit. In other words, taking public expenditure as given, private consumption will not be affected Ly fiscal deficits. The distinction between the first two arguments and the last is of considerable importance to policy-makers. If Ricardian equivalence holds, then reductions on fiscal deficits will not affect the level of consumption in the economy and the basis for deficit reduction as part of stabilization programs no longer exists. In this case, policies and programs to reduce fiscal deficits may be completely misdirected. However, the conditions necessary for Ricardian equivalence to hold are very strict. They include the following: no liquidity constraints; household's planning horizons must be infinite; the rate of discount applied to future income by consumers must be equal to the rate at which the public sector can borrow; and consumers must act rationally in forming expectations of future tax liabilities. Given these conditions, particularly that concerning liquidity constraints, we would not expect to find evidence of Ricardian equivalence in Ghana where credit to the private sector is highly regulated. While most of the empirical work on Ricardian equivalence concerns developed countries (the early literature tended to support Ricardian equivalence whereas much of it now rejects it), there have recently been a few studies that have focused on Ricardian equivalence in developing countries. Haque and Montiel (1987) test for the empirical relevance of Ricardian equivalence in sixteen developing countries by considering whether the liquidity constraint condition and the Yaari-Blanchard condition\" hold. The empirical estimates derived in their paper suggest that full Ricardian Equivalence can be rejected in 15 of the sixteen countries in the sample. Their model found evidence that the prevelence of liquidity 0 Leiderman and Razin (1988) test for Ricardian equivalence in Israel. Their framework considered two channels which might cause deviations from Ricardian equivalence: the finite horizons/Yaari-Blanchard effect and liquidity constraints. Their estimation found that the restrictions imposed by the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis could not be rejected. Expansion of their model to allow for public goods consumption did not alter these results. Haque (1988) focused on the Yaari-Blanchard proposition of finite horizons for consumer planning problems as the source of deviation from Ricardian equivalence. The results of his tests found evidence in favor of the infinitely-lived households in 15 out of the 16 countries tested. Finally, Rossi (1989) develops an approach that emphasizes real interest rates and liquidity constraints in the determination of consumer behavior. He uses pooled data of geographical regions and finds strong evidence that where liquidity constraints are substantial they do have an important effect on consumer behavior and imply that Ricardian equivalence does not hold. In sum, the evidence for developing countries (with the exception of Leiderman and Razin) indicates that Ricardian equivalence does not hold and that the existence of fiscal deficits and their financing will have aconomic effects. Our first attempts at estimating the consumption function followed the research proposal quite closely, variables on public tax and expenditure composition. Given the generally poor nature of Ghanaian data and the high probability that significant collinearity exists among some of the fiscal variables discussed, we decided to abandon the numerous variables suggested in the project proposal and to opt for a much simpler estimation. The equation estimated i. C-+ a 1 YPt + a2 rht + 3 LCt + 4 FISCDEF, + , where Ct is current private consumption, Ypt is current disposable income as described above, LCt credit to the private sector and FISCDEF; is th't conventional measure of the fiscal deficit as discussed in part II. All variables are as in percent of GDP. Ideally one would use a measure of labor income to determine permanent income, however, no data on labor income are available for Ghana. Following Haque and Montiel (1987) we use GNP minus taxes as our measure of disposable/permanent income. Dornbusch (1983) makes a case for using the \"home\" real interest rate or the \"consumption-based\" real interest rate. He argues that the presence of a home goods (nontradable) sector implies that the relevant real interest rate appropriate to consumption decisions depends on the rate of change of the real price of home goods. This \"consumption-based\" real interest rate is thus the rate used in our consumption regression. It is calculated according to the following definition (from Dornbusch): r = (1 +r*) (Pt/P )1 , where r* is the world real interest rate (we used the U.S. rate), Pt is the relative price of home goods in terms of traded goods, and 1-a is the share of hom3 goods (nontradables) in consumption. The domestic credit to the private sector (from IFS) is used as a proxy for liquidity constraints. The measurement of liquidity constraints in Ghana poses particular difficulties because there is an extensive network of informal credit arrangements that do not appear in any of the official statistics. The measure used may therefore not completely capture the effective liquidity constraint, but it seems to be the best available proxy. The measure of the fiscal deficit used is the conventional measure as discussed in Part II. In the estimation of this equation there was evidence of autocorrelation so a lagged dependent variable was added to the equation. The estimation of this second equation found only lagged consumption and disposable 4 ncome to be significant. The interest variable, the private credit variable and the fiscal deficit variable were all found to be insignificant. The results of the final estimation are as follows: (absolute values of t-statistics are in parentheses) C = .04999 + .6668 C(-1) + .3152 Yp, = 86.13 (.005) (5.24) raise private investment.

The significance of Yp indicates that some consumers are liquidity constrained which we expect to find in Ghana. Our equation unfortunately does not allow us to say anything about the effects of the fiscal deficits on consumption. Public expenditure and public revenue variables were incorporated into other estimations, but neither was significant. Further research on the interaction between fiscal deficits and private consumption is therefore needed. 2.) Fiscal Deficits and Private layesta2nt The issue of private investment in Ghana is a particularly important one at present when it has become clear that to sustain high growth rates while simultaneously reducing government involvement in the economy would require a substantial increase in private investment. The fiscal deficit is expected to affect private sector investment in a number of ways. Firstly, higher public sector expenditure financed by public sector borrowing can crowd out private sector investment. There are two channels by which this investors; this means that investment has to be financed by nominal interest rate ceilings accompanied by high rates of inflation have led to negative real interest rates. Table 4.2 shows the real interest rate and the rate of inflation from 1965 to 1988.41 Public sector investment may have an additional effect on private investment depending on whether or not it is a substitute for or complement to public investment. If the government (or government entities) invest in areas that the private sector would invest in anyway or if they undertake investment activities that would make private investment activities unprofitable then higher public investment would tend to lower private investment. On the other hand, if public investment consists of activities that raise the profitability of private investment (for instance-investment in certain kinds of infrastructure) and which the private sector itself does not find profitable to engage in then higher public investment may ' t We have calculated the rate of inflation using the consumer price index. 13.611 -8.4597 -3.6098 7.8947 10.565 17.683 -10.907 18.135 1975 -17.003 29.825 -30.966 56.081 -50.219 116.45 -35.298 73.100 -27.470 54.419 -25.380 50.093 -45.263 116.49 -10.463 22.296 -49.299 122.87 -16.372 39.665 6.7943 10.306 -3.8253 24.565 -12.170 39.815 -8.9521 31.359 Source: International Financial Statistics and Quartarly Digest of Statistics, Bank of Ghana. (uncertainty regarding future economic policy, etc.) all of which determine the overall profitability of investment. While profitability of investing does not seem to be a problem : agents are willing to invest more given the current economic environment but are constrained by other factors (access to credit). The investment equation that we have estimated for Ghana seems to confirm what we would expect from our analysis of Ghana's economy.

TBSIM7 is the estimated txade surplus with public sector expenditure constant at the 1970 level. TS2 is the actual trade surplus. We see that in almost all of the years the trade surplus would have been substantially larger if public sector expenditure had remained constant. We see for instance, that in 1981, instead of a $244 million deficit we would have had a $313 million surplus. TBSIM8 shows what the trade surplus would have been if the terms of trade had remained at their 1970 level and TBSIM9 shows the trade surplus estimates with the terms of trade held at their 1974 (high) level.",

Even with a very favorable terms of trade (the 1974 level), the premium would have been high during these years if the fiscal deficit had remained at its actual level. In summary, our empirical results seem to indicate that high public sector expenditure (or a high fiscal deficit) has contributed to Ghana's external sector problems and that if the government had pursued more moderate fiscal (lower public sector expenditure) and monetary (less money creation and therefore a lower premium) policies, the economy would have done better. In particular, there would have been a more favorable exchange rate, the trade balance would have improved significantly better and there would have been fewer black market activities. 7 4 These are based on equation (c).",
