        "text": "In a context that might be similar to the situation many countries might confront when the COVID-19 pandemic eases and finally ends, school enrollment increased nationwide and rapidly in Guinea in the aftermath of Ebola. We find that it increased significantly more in treated villages. From a low baseline of around 40 percent of primary-school age enrollment, 4 treated villages increased their school enrollment by more than 11 percentage points compared to control villages. But this massive increase in school enrollment did not lead to impacts on learning outcomes as measured by mathematics, French and literacy. This result is in line with the previous literature on cash transfers, which is large and has been reviewed extensively (Fiszbein and Schady 2009; Snilstveit et al. 2015, Ganimian and Murnane, 2016; Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016 and Molina Mill\u00e1n et al., 2019) . The overall conclusion from those reviews is that cash transfers increase time spent in school nearly everywhere where they have been evaluated. But the effect of the transfer programs on learning is often limited. 5 However, our design with three different sub-groups (households eligible according to the poverty targeting were randomly allocated to transfers of 0, 8 or 16 USD/quarter/child) allows us to obtain more specific contributions related to the design and targeting of cash transfer programs. Compared to the control villages, the effect of the treatment on enrollment is increasing for each successive sub-group in the treated villages. The effect is 7 percentage points (significant at the 10 percent level) for the group with no cash transfers but who received an information campaign and resided in communities where some neighbors received cash, compared to villages with neither. It increases to 11 and then to 17 percentage points for households receiving respectively 70,000 (8 USD) and 140,000 GNF (16 USD).",

Second, the slope of progress of Raven scores seems identical between the baseline and the endline. There is on average an increase of 0.4 points per year, until aged 12, where the increase slows.

The authors find that this disruption in health services created a second public health crisis. The authors predicted in 2015 that the lack of vaccinations would lead to an important rise in measles and in children's mortality rates. The lack of vaccination for children as a consequence of Ebola is documented in many reports and papers. Camara et al.

The authors find that the highest gaps were in polio and pentavalent vaccines, which had shortages of respectively 40 and 38 percent. Colavita et al.

The EVD reduced at the same time the supply and the demand for other types of health care services.

At the same time, vaccines were also in short supply because the focus on Ebola led both international donors and the national administration to shift their focus away from vaccines (Takahashi et al. 2015) . As a consequence, given the negative supply shock, we cannot estimate the increase in demand for vaccination from the soft conditional cash transfers and the accompanying information campaign.",
