This paper uses a unique survey of fourteen European countries to ask firms directly about the incidence of wage cuts and to assess the relevance of a range of potential reasons for why the firms avoid cutting wages. The paper examines how firm characteristics and collective bargaining institutions affect the relevance of each of the common explanations put forward for the infrequency of wage cuts. Concerns about the retention of productive staff and a lowering of morale and effort were reported as key reasons for downward wage rigidity across all countries and firm types. Restrictions created by collective bargaining were found to be an important consideration for firms in Western European (EU-15) countries but were one of the lowest ranked obstacles in the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe.",

        "text": "The difficulty inherent in reducing nominal wages has recently moved into the spotlight as a result of efforts of a number of European countries, especially within the euro area, to adjust to serious negative economic shocks through internal devaluation. Even with the severity of the economic downturn experienced across Europe in recent years, cuts in nominal wages appear to be a last resort for firms, and a series of papers have established that wages tend to be sticky downwards. 1 Evidence from interviews with business owners and firm managers have even suggested that selective layoffs are usually preferred to across-the-board wage reductions (Bewley, 1999) . Bertola et al. (2012) , using data from the same survey of European firms that this paper will analyse, found that only 2% of firms would use base wage cuts as the main channel of labour cost reduction if faced with a significant cost shock. A considerably higher percentage reported that they would rely on reducing staff numbers or hours worked as their main strategy. 2 So why is it so difficult to cut nominal wages? This paper uses evidence from a firm survey conducted in a number of EU countries to investigate a range of different theories as to why firms appear reluctant to lower wages. The sample covers 14,975 firms from 14 European countries, representing around 47.3 million employees. Although the data collection predates the onset of the European crisis, the survey provides unique and valuable information on the extent and rationale for wage rigidity, and enables us to evaluate the importance of different explanations for avoiding wage cuts.",

In particular, the categorisation used by Campbell and Kamlani (1997) was used as the main basis for the selection of questions put to the firms. These questions reflect a range of different hypotheses put forward in the literature covering the influence of labour regulations and collective agreements, the existence of implicit contracts, efficiency wage explanations in terms of negative effects on worker morale or effort, whether firms have concerns about losing key staff or having difficulties in future recruitment if wages were to be cut, whether the costs of future recruitment and training would be higher, and whether they felt employees would be concerned with how their wage compared to that of similar workers in other firms. 3 In line with previous research, we find that very few firms -in total approximately 2% -report having cut nominal base wages within a five year period, although there are differences across countries in how common wage cuts are, particularly between the original members of the European Union (EU-15) and the newer member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The most relevant reasons given for avoiding base wage cuts are concerns about worker morale and the danger that the most productive workers would leave. In contrast to previous findings from the USA, a third prominent reason preventing wage cuts is institutional restrictions; this reason also showed the greatest variation across countries, which can be linked to the institutional factors specific to each country such as the prevalence and type of collective bargaining.",

Larger firms are less likely to assign high relevance to the existence of implicit contracts as a rationale for avoiding wage cuts. Some of the highest ranked reasons for avoiding wage cuts, such as the fear of workers reducing their effort or possible negative impacts on workers' morale, appear to apply across the board with little variation across firms of different sizes or employing workers with different characteristics. In the text we offer a discussion of these findings, and their relationship with prominent theories of the functioning of labor markets.",

        "text": "The lack of downward flexibility of wages has generated a wide range of explanations in the literature on labor economics. Amongst the most prominent of these explanations are efficiency wage models that are based on the assumption that the effort of workers may be stimulated by paying high or at least \"fair\" wages (see Akerlof, 1982 and Akerlof and Yellen, 1990 ). Related to this, the turnover model assumes that persistently high wages might actually increase firm profitability by reducing the quit rate and hence lowering expenditures on hiring and training (Hashimoto and Yu, 1980; Stiglitz, 1974) . Higher wages may also raise the quality of the firm's applicant pool, reducing adverse selection issues (Weiss, 1980) . Other theories, such as insider-outsider bargaining models also generate real wage rigidity, especially among core workers (Lindbeck and Snower, 1988) .",

More explicitly, Holden (1994) shows that unions and collective agreements provide protection against individual wage cuts in a theoretical framework that allows for individual and collective bargaining. We complement the information obtained by asking managers directly about the importance of labor regulation and collective agreements in preventing wage cuts with further questions on the extent of union coverage and the types of collective bargaining engaged in by the firm (for example, if these are firm, sectoral or national level arrangements).",

If the relativity with the external pay comparator is breached the worker would feel unfairly treated, with negative consequences on morale and the worker attachment to the firms' objectives.

(2009) and point to the sharp difference between the EU-15 and CEE countries in collective bargaining coverage and the pervasiveness of sectoral agreements over firm agreements. 11 In Austria, Belgium, Spain, France, and Italy the coverage of collective agreements is almost universal within the sectors included in the survey. The same is true of Slovenia, making it somewhat of an outlier amongst the CEE group.",

In France, however, all firms are subject to collective agreements signed at the sectoral or national level, regardless of whether a firm-level agreement exists or not. In most of the CEE countries in contrast, firms that sign firm-level agreements with unions are usually not subject to national or sectoral negotiations.

The survey provides quantitative information on the proportion of firms that have cut wages and also on the proportions of workers affected by wage cuts in these firms. Specifically, firms were asked if they had ever cut base wages during the past five years. 12 If they responded \"yes\" to this question, they were further asked what percentage of their workforce this cut had applied to. Firms were instructed to answer the wage-setting questions with reference to their main occupational group, which was defined earlier in the survey. Table 2 verifies that wage cuts are extremely rare. Around 2.4% of the firms had cut wages over the five years that preceded the survey, and this strategy affected only 0.8% of the workers in the sample, and 34.8% of the workers working in firms that had cut wages. Thus, firms very seldom cut wages in normal times, and when they engage in wage cutting practices they do this selectively.",

For example, the impact on firm reputation, hiring difficulty and the existence of implicit contracts appear to be slightly more relevant for firms in the CEE countries than in the EU-15. The higher relevance of the first two theories for firms in the CEE countries may be related to the higher proportion of temporary contracts and the greater levels of worker turnover. Temporary contracts account for 16% of employment in CEE compared to 9% in the EU-15 and employee turnover is 5 pp higher in CEE countries (see section 4 for more on this measure).

This is likely to be related to the substantial differences in the institutional structure of the wage-setting process across the European Union member states. As was indicated in Section 3.2, the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements tends to be much higher in EU-15 than in CEE. The difference stems mostly from the reach of collective agreements negotiated outside the firm at the sectoral or regional level (see Table 1 ).

This difference can be attributed to varying coverage of collective bargaining agreements, which tends to be much higher in EU-15 countries than in most of the CEE countries.",

Larger firms are more likely to be aware of the potential complications associated with reductions in nominal pay and to assign higher relevance to most of the possible reasons for avoiding wage cuts. Fears about lower effort and lower morale are systematically given as highly relevant reasons for avoiding wage cuts across firms of any type.",
