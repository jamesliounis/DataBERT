The available evidence indicates that computers are substitutes for middle-skilled workers performing routine tasks but are complements to high-skilled workers performing activities difficult to automate such as creative thinking and problem resolution. Reduced trade costs, on the other hand, are promoting the offshoring of some low-and middle-skilled routine work to countries where labor and transportation costs are relatively low and regional value chains are reasonably well established.",

Most of the available evidence has been focused on developed countries, but there are reasons to believe that technology and globalization are affecting developing countries differently from advanced economies. The two groups of countries differ in the skill base of their populations and in labor standards, which may affect the incentives to adopt technology and create new jobs (AfDB et al., 2018) . The initial occupational structure of employment differs as well, with a smaller share of middle-income workers performing routine tasks in developing countries (Maloney and Molina, 2016) . And the patterns of trade may have a role in shaping labor markets, as developed economies are offshoring low-or medium-skill work and competing with imports from less-developed countries such as China (Autor et al., 2015) , while developing countries continue to provide the main contribution to growth in export volumes (Constantinescu et al., 2017) .",

We focus our analysis on Indonesia over the period 2005-2015, when ICT use increased markedly and there was a large shift in exports, from the commodity boom between 2005 and 2010 to a period of declining exports between 2011 and 2015. 2 The commodity boom started in the early 2000s and led to an increase in the export shares of mining and mineral products at the expense of manufactured products (World Bank, 2016) . The end of the commodity boom around 2011 increased the participation of manufactures in total exports. Although our interest is on goods trade and technology and their impact on labor markets, we recognize that trade in services, such as tourism and e-commerce, can affect the demand for skills depending on the skill intensity of these sub-sectors.",

With this information, we generate aggregate labor market indicators (labor force participation, employment and unemployment rates) for each province and year, and we construct the occupational structure of employment within each province, industry and year that we use as an input to construct the skills measures. We separate the analysis in two subperiods, 2005-2010 and 2011-2015, to account for the change in the weighting scheme introduced in the Sakernas surveys in 2011. These sub-periods differed greatly: 2005-2010 was characterized by a boom in commodity prices and a large increase in mineral exports, while 2011-2015 exhibited a decline in exports that was larger for mining and mineral products.",

We expect that changes in a province's level of technological development will be associated with changes in the structure of employment by skills. Previous literature for developed countries has found that increased use of computers increases the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills and reduces the demand for routine skills (Autor et al., 2003; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos et al., 2014) . In our analysis we use the share of households with a computer in each province as a proxy for the level of technological development available to firms in that province. This proxy may be signaling the use of other, more advanced technologies, which may in turn lead to different adjustment patterns in the structure of employment by skills (Almeida et al., 2019) . In terms of employment indicators, the impact of technology on labor force participation, employment and unemployment rates will depend on the size of the complementarity and substitution effects of technology.",

When studying the interplay between the trade and technology measures, we find that exports and technological development reinforce each other --e.g. the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills increases with provincial technological development and increases more in industries with higher value of exports per worker. We explain this reinforcing effect by the characteristics of this sub-period --exports were focused on commodities that used non-routine analytical and interpersonal skills more intensively relative to other industries. We also find evidence of technological development being labor-saving in Indonesia during 2005-2010 except for women, and exports being labor-increasing for higheducated and female workers.",

By contrast, the technology measure has a negative impact on the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills and a positive effect on the demand for routine manual skills. However, when analyzing the interplay between trade and technology, we find that technological development is complementary to analytic and interpersonal skills for a specific group of industries --high-exporting industries. The effects on aggregate labor market indicators indicate that the previous evidence on the labor-saving nature of technology in Indonesia over the 2005-2010 subperiod is not present in 2011-2015; technology leads to increases in employment and reductions in unemployment, at least for high-and low-educated workers, respectively.

Among the studies using household and labor force surveys or administrative data in developing countries, there is evidence that occupations using ICT more intensively have a high demand for cognitive skills and a low demand for routine and non-routine manual skills (Santos et al., 2015) . find that technological change, as measured by the share of households connected to the internet, does not appear to be a main driver of the demand for skills in Vietnam. In a similar study, show that the adoption of computers by households in Vietnam is strongly associated with increases in the demand for non-routine manual tasks and routine cognitive tasks. Based on employer-employee data from Brazil, Almeida et al. (2017a) find that the rollout of the internet between 1996 and 2006 was associated with a reduction in employment and a fall in demand by technology-intensive industries for routine tasks, thus shifting the composition of employment towards non-routine tasks. Finally, Almeida et al. (2019) find that the use of advanced software reduces the relative demand for analytical skills by Chilean firms. This indicates that the impact of technology on the demand for different types of skills depends on the technology considered. Their finding is relevant for our study, where the share of households with a computer is used as a proxy for the level of technological development accessible by firms. This proxy may be signaling the use of more advanced technologies by firms, which could have a different impact on the demand for skills than simply the adoption of computers.",

There is substantial evidence showing that increased exposure to international markets affects the level and occupational composition of employment. Autor et al. (2015) find that competition from Chinese goods significantly reduced employment in the United States, especially in manufacturing industries and among low-educated workers. Cortes et al. (2016) find that workers who lose their routine jobs in the United States due to import competition tend to move to non-routine manual jobs or non-employment. The offshoring of some production tasks, mainly routine tasks, can reduce employment. However, offshoring also enables firms to be more productive, increasing their output level and employment (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008) . As a result, the final effect on employment is ambiguous. Ebenstein et al. (2014) show that offshoring from the United States to China did not have a negative impact on employment, but reduced labor force participation. For developing countries, provide evidence for Vietnam indicating that trade, measured by the value of exports, expands the use of both routine and non-routine manual tasks, shifting the composition of employment towards lower-skilled workers.",

During this period, the survey was representative at the province level and covered all 33 provinces of the country. Starting in 2011 the Sakernas survey changed the weighting scheme. This change leads us to separate the analysis in two sub-period: 2005-2010 and 2011-2015. Using the Sakernas survey we construct aggregate labor market indicators that we use as outcome variables in our econometric analysis: the labor force participation, employment and unemployment rates for the working age population (15 years old and more) and for different population sub-groups (men and women, and low-and high-educated workers). We also calculate the share of each occupation in total province-industry-year employment that we use as inputs to construct our skills measures (see below). Finally, we use the Sakernas survey to generate variables used as controls in the econometric analysis. These variables include the age composition of the population and the share of urban population in each province and year, and the composition of industrial employment by educational level and by gender in each year of data.",

Many studies in a similar situation rely on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*Net database, which collects occupation-specific attributes for detailed occupations in the United States. However, the United States and Indonesia differ greatly in their levels of development and production technologies, which could affect both the levels and rankings of the skills used in each occupation. Another possibility is to use information from the World Bank's STEP (Skills Towards Employment and Productivity) survey of working-age people (15-64), which covers Vietnam and the Philippines in East Asia. Unfortunately, the survey mostly covers urban areas, which makes it less relevant for Indonesia where only half of the population is urban. On balance, we decided to use the 2015-2016 STEP survey of the Philippines for our main results and the U.S. O*Net database as a robustness exercise. 3 Drawing on Autor et al. (2003) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) , we define the skill content of occupations using the following categories: non-routine analytical, non-routine interpersonal, routine cognitive, routine manual, and non-routine manual. Analytical skills are measured by the number of different types of documents read, length of longest document typically read, writing activities, use of math, frequency of thinking for at least 30 minutes, and frequency of learning new things. Interpersonal skills involve supervising coworkers, making presentations, contact with clients, and frequency of collaborating with coworkers. To capture routine cognitive skills, we use a measure of structured versus unstructured work captured by a scale indicating the lack of freedom a worker has to decide the way he works. Routine manual skills are defined as driving, operating machines, and repairing electronic equipment, along with a scale indicating how physically demanding the work is. Finally, non-routine manual skills are measured by the frequency of doing repetitive tasks. Table A1 in the Appendix provides more details on these variables.",

The level of technological development of a province should affect the structure of employment by skills. However, the impact of an increase in technology will differ depending on the type of technology involved. Previous literature has found that computers increase the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills and reduce the demand for routine skills. In this study we use the share of households with a computer as a proxy for the technological development accessible by firms in each province. This proxy may indicate the use of different types of technologies, e.g., more advanced types of technologies, that may have different effects on the structure of employment by skills. Therefore, the impact of the province's technological development on the demand for skills is a question we need to answer empirically. Also, we expect the impact of technology on labor force participation, employment and unemployment to depend on the extent to which the technology complements, or substitutes for, labor.",

Depending on the type of industrial products the rest of the world demands, i.e., specific products within each of the 22 industries we defined, the increase in production may require the use of all or only some of the five skills we use in our analysis. This is especially relevant when considering the two subperiods we use in the study. Mining exports, which are intensive in the use of analytical and interpersonal skills in comparison to other industries, expanded sharply in 2005-2010. By contrast, the decline in exports in 2011-2015 affected mining more than manufacturing, which is intensive in the use of routine and non-routine manual skills in comparison to other industries. It could also be the case that non-routine analytical and interpersonal skills are favored in the adjustment process, regardless of the sub-period being analyzed, as the production of exporting goods has been reported to be high-skill intensive in comparison to production for the domestic market (Bernard and Jensen, 1999; Matsuyama, 2007) .",

However, this could happen through global value chains channels. For instance, the global demand for Chinese products can affect Indonesian demand for skills through the inputs Indonesia provides to China. To deal with this potential threat to the exclusion restriction of the instrument, we provide additional evidence excluding industries strongly involved in GVCs, i.e., mining and chemicals, from the analysis. Table 4 presents first-stage results for the two sub-periods we analyze and for different specifications. Column (1) includes as control variables the age structure of the population, share of urban population, real GDP per capita, minimum wage level, and composition of employment by educational level and by gender, but does not include the share of households with a computer; column (2) adds the technology measure at the province level as a regressor; columns (3) and (4) correspond to the first stage estimates when the main model includes the trade measure, the technology measure, and their interaction. In the interactive model we also include the interaction between Zjt (the global demand for product j in year t) and the share of households with a computer as an instrumental variable. The global demand for foreign products (excluding Indonesian products) is positively and significantly associated with the value of Indonesian exports per worker. The interaction between the instrument and the share of households with a computer is positive and significant in 2005-2010 and significant in 2011-2015 only in column (4). The positive sign of the interaction term in column (3) during 2005-2010 reflects better possibilities of satisfying the global demand for foreign products in more technologically-advanced provinces, at least during 2005-2010. The F statistic surpasses 10 in all cases, the Staiger and Stock (1997) rule for rejection of the hypothesis of weak instruments with one endogenous variable.

The model including the interaction term between trade and technology measures shows that the unemployment rate increases both with the value of exports and with the share of households with a computer, and there is a negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the interaction term (column 4 in Table 7 ). These last results can be interpreted as follows. First, an increase in the value of exports per worker increases the unemployment rate through the adjustment in the skill composition of employment. Second, an expansion in the technology measure increases the unemployment rate through the reduction in the use of routine skills and the replacement of workers who were performing routine tasks by the technology. Finally, the negative correlation between the interaction term and unemployment indicates that the positive impact of exports (technology) on the unemployment rate is smoothed in more technology advanced provinces (in provinces that export more) because part of the adjustment has already been made in those provinces.",

On the contrary, technological development in Indonesia during 2011-2015 was a substitute for the skills used more intensively by high-educated workers. This result also contrasts with the evidence found for 2005-2010, which was in line with previous findings for developed countries. A potential explanation is that our proxy for the technological development available for firms in each provincial labor market is capturing different technologies in each sub-period, and that these technologies were more advanced and tended to be substitutes for high-skilled workers in the more recent period.",

Our previous explanation for this finding was that our proxy for the technological development available for firms in each provincial labor market was capturing a more advanced type of technology and not just the adoption of computers during 2011-2015. The lack of this result when excluding industries more strongly involved in GVCs would indicate that the adoption of more advanced types of technologies took place in these industries. Also contrary to earlier results, we do not find that an increase in employment is associated with an increase in exports and we do find that an increase in technology adoption is associated with a reduction in labor force participation and employment. We argue that industries involved in GVCs explained the previous increase in employment linked to exports and the lack of effect of the technology measure.",

Our conjecture is that this change implied an important shift in the demand for different types of skills as minerals, the main commodity of the country, used non-routine analytical and interpersonal skills more intensively in comparison to other industries, while manufactured products were more intensive in the use of non-routine manual and routine skills.",

When studying the interplay between the trade and technology measures, we find that exports and technological development reinforce each other --e.g. the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills increases with provincial technological development and increases more in industries with a higher value of exports per worker. This reinforcing effect is due to the characteristics of this sub-period, marked by strong increases in the export of commodities that used non-routine analytical and interpersonal skills more intensively relative to other industries. We also find evidence of technological development being labor-saving in Indonesia during 2005-2010 except for women, and exports being labor-increasing for higheducated and female workers.",

The technology measure has a negative impact on the demand for analytical and interpersonal skills and a positive effect on the demand for routine manual skills.

The previous finding on the labor-saving nature of technology in Indonesia over the 2005-2010 sub-period is not confirmed for 2011-2015, as increases in technology lead to increases in employment and reductions in unemployment, for high-and low-educated workers respectively.

This confirms that differences in economic structures can generate large differences in the way countries are affected by technological advances and globalization. In developed countries, technology (captured through the use of computers) reduces the demand for routine skills, while in Indonesia we find effects in the opposite direction during the 2011-2015 sub-period. The impact of trade in developed countries is also linked to reductions in the use of routine skills and in employment more generally. For Indonesia, we find that higher exports lead to increases in the relative use of non-routine analytical and interpersonal skills and to increases in employment during 2011-2015.",

For the routine manual and interpersonal skills measures we find rank correlation coefficients of 0.49 and 0.57 respectively. For non-routine cognitive the rank correlation coefficient is negative. We believe this can explained by the different type of information we captured from STEP and O*Net to construct this measure. In the STEP survey, the variable we use captures the structured vs. unstructured nature of the job, while in the O*Net database the routine cognitive measure comes from the activity \"documenting/recording information\".

In this situation, the approach followed by many studies is to use the U.S. Department of Labor's O*Net database, which collects occupation-specific attributes for detailed occupations. The disadvantage of using U.S. data is that these two countries, the United States and Indonesia, differ in their development levels and production technologies, which may impact both the levels and rankings of the skills used in each occupation. Another possibility is to use information from the STEP (Skills Towards Employment and Productivity) survey, which is collected by the World Bank in some East Asian countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines. This is an individual-level survey conducted among working-age people (15-64) mostly residing in urban areas. This urban feature of the STEP survey is a disadvantage for a country like Indonesia where only half of the population is urban. We decided to proceed using the STEP survey of the Philippines for our main results, a country from the East Asian region with a development level similar to Indonesia, and the U.S. O*Net database as a robustness exercise. 8",

We work with a sample of 1,565 workers aged 15-64. We mapped the Philippines Standard Occupational Classification, that follows closely the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) 2008, to the Indonesian Classification of Occupation 1982 that is used in the Sakernas (the Indonesian National Labor Force Survey). We work with six occupational groups: administrative and managerial workers; professionals and technicians; clerical workers; sales and services workers; agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry workers, fishermen and hunters; and production workers, transport and equipment operators, and laborers. We combine the variables capturing each type of skill in the STEP survey into a single skill measure for each occupation following the methodology applied by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) . The variables used are listed in the second column of Table A1 .First, for each variable associated with any of the five types of skills, we calculate the mean and standard deviation across the sample of 1,565 workers and standardize the variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Second, for each worker we obtain scores for each of the five types of skills by adding all the standardized variables obtained in the previous step associated with non-routine analytical skills (7 variables), non-routine interpersonal skills (3 variables), non-routine manual skills (4 variables), routine manual skills (1 variables), and routine cognitive skills (1 variable). We standardize each of the five scores by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. Finally, for each occupational group, we calculate a weighted average of the value of each of the five standardized skills scores using as weights the contribution ",
