What are the sequences and shapes of the development paths followed by various FD indicators? Remarkably, the literature (particularly empirical) on these issues is relatively thin. The proposition that financial structure is shaped by the efforts of market participants to circumvent and reduce the frictions that hinder financial contracting is of course a familiar one. 2 Yet, few papers have attempted to analyze these frictions systematically in terms of the way they interact and what this may imply for the dynamics of FD. Interestingly, more work has been done on measuring the impact of FD on economic growth than on exploring how FD is affected by economic growth. 3 And when discussing the impact of financial structure on growth, the literature, at least until very recently, generally concluded that function matters more than form. 4 FD has been typically understood as a relatively smooth and predictable march from \"relationship-based finance\" to \"arms-length finance\" involving a systematic process of market completion driven by a gradual reduction of agency frictions. 5 However, the global financial crisis showed that FD has a \"dark side\" that can make it both non-linear and bumpy. Thus, what may appear as FD progress can in fact exacerbate market failures, thereby undermining financial sustainability.",

Based on cross-section development paths (derived from an econometric exercise that averages countries' financial development over a thirty-year time span for a large set of FD indicators), the paper finds that-except for some notable outliers whose deviant behavior is in itself quite informative-these patterns are, indeed, broadly verified. In particular, public debt, banking, and capital markets develop sequentially and under increasingly convex paths. However, the paper also finds that the dynamic development paths followed by specific country groups can deviate substantially from the cross-section paths. This may reflect country-specific development policies, path dependence, innovation-induced leapfrogging, cycles and crashes, or quantum jumps in financial development past some level of income.",

It concludes that financial instability, in the form of financial crashes rather than simple financial volatility, can account for large and lasting gaps, particularly as regards private credit depth and bank margins. Demand effects, as proxied by past output growth, can also account for substantial cross-country differentials in financial depth. On the supply side, enabling environment factors such as enforcement costs, and creditor or property rights also play an important role, albeit on average somewhat more limited than stability or demand effects. This analysis also leads to useful insights as regards the order and relative ease with which frictions are overcome. In particular, we find that information frictions appear early but are easier to overcome than contractual frictions. While the former are mostly technological and can be easily imported, the latter mostly reflect collective action frictions that are strictly home-based, hence trickier to resolve.",

        "text": "Two basic classes of frictions hinder financial transactions-agency frictions and collective frictions. Each class can, in turn, be subdivided into two categories: one relates to informational frictions, which relate to agents' limited capacity to obtain or understand information; another relates to what we can loosely define as relational frictions, that is, agents' capacity to agree and to act upon collectively beneficial financial arrangements, on the one hand, and to their capacity to enforce bilateral contracts, on the other (Table 1) . This typology underpins four paradigms, two of which-asymmetric information (AI) and costly enforcement (CE)-are associated with agency frictions, and the other two-collective action (CA) and collective cognition (CC)-with collective frictions. The four paradigms can be associated with the different stages a financial contract goes through, from preparing the contract to negotiating and enforcing it (Table 1) . 6 Agency frictions hinder FD because they limit the capacity of individuals to delegate and contract bilaterally. Asymmetric information frictions lead to a misalignment of incentives between the \"principal\" and the \"agent\"-the agent can use his informational advantage to act in ways that are not in the interest of the principal. This, in turn, can trigger the commonly known market failures of adverse selection, moral hazard and shirking, and false reporting. Information asymmetry frictions limit financial contracts to those where agents have their own resources at risk (\"skin in the game\") and/or where the principal can adequately screen and monitor the agent. Enforcement frictions also lead to a misalignment of incentives between the \"principal\" and the \"agent,\" but in this case due to imperfect pledgeability-a situation where the agent is unable to credibly commit to honor the contract. Imperfect pledgeability thus restricts financial contracts to those that can be effectively collateralized.",

Much of the gains from financial activity relate to the reduction in transaction costs and the increase in liquidity and risk diversification benefits that result from arrangements in which many agents participate. Such arrangements can take the form of markets, where transactions can be conducted around a simple trading platform, or financial institutions (a bank, an insurance company, a mutual fund) that offer services whose benefits are pooled across a large number of customers. Network effects are central to this process. The higher the number of participants, the higher the benefits of participation. However, participation is hindered by cognition frictions-one does not participate in an activity that is not well understood-as well as collective action frictions, which typically restrict the setting up and operation of multilateral pooling arrangements. 7 Market participants who wish to engage in financial contracting must, therefore, find the path of least resistance around these frictions and the associated market failures. Once a decision is made to participate in financial contracts, the private responses to coping with frictions can be divided into two subsets: responses aimed at lessening the frictions themselves (acquiring information, using collateral, delegating) and responses aimed at lessening the exposure to these frictions (diversifying and pooling risk, buying insurance and hedges, staying liquid). In turn, the state seeks to facilitate these private responses through a set of progressively more intrusive public interventions: (i) the provision of a basic contractual and informational infrastructure that facilitates private bilateral contracting; (ii) the regulation and taxation needed to internalize externalities or protect consumers; (iii) coordination arrangements that facilitate participation (catalytic involvement, systemic lending of last resort, government guarantees); and (iv) the direct provision by the state of financial services (possibly in competition with those offered by the private sector).",

As another example, take the need for risk reduction through diversification: capital markets allow investors to diversify by buying assets with different risk profiles; instead, banks, insurance companies, and asset managers provide diversification through pooling.

An early resolution of collective action frictions (including through the introduction of central banks) sets the stage by allowing for basic payment and custody services. Once this is done, financial markets start resolving agency frictions by relying on non-tradable and immovable collateral and connections, that is, on relationship-based transactions. As the informational and contractual environment improves, private information becomes public and other types of collateral become available and tradable, gradually allowing FD to break free from the tyranny of connections. Similarly, as information becomes more abundant and governance arrangements improve, monitoring costs come down and monitoring can increasingly rely on third parties (rating agencies, market analysts, investment advisors, external auditors), statistical methods (scoring systems, value-at-risk calculations), and accounting and disclosure standards.",

Since activities that exhibit the highest returns to scale should generally be the ones exposed to the highest collective frictions, scale effects should correlate with the order in which financial activities appear and the shape (convexity or concavity) of their development path. 10 As we will see below, these basic patterns are broadly verified. However, before shifting from analytics to empirics, consider first the dark side of the finance frictions.",

The first one refers to the inability to resolve the agency frictions or collective (participation) frictions that hinder FD. Failures to reduce agency frictions continue to dominate the FD literature. They may occur at the level of the investor (reflecting his inability to monitor or lack of interest in doing so), at the level of the borrower (reflecting problems of 9 Indeed, the history of FD is marked by major waves of innovation. Consider, for instance, the role in the exponential ascent of finance in the western world stemming from the invention of Italian banking (based on traderelated bills of exchange) by the Medici in the late XIV century; or the introduction of payments systems based on checking accounts, fractional reserve banking, and central banking during the XVII century; or the development of the government bond market, its seeds already visible in the late middle ages; or the invention of the joint-stock, limited liability company in the early XVII century and the associated mushrooming of stock exchanges; or the emergence of marine insurance and life insurance in the second half of the XVII century; or, in the latter part of the XX century, the development of securitization and derivative products. For an insightful and entertaining rendition of the history of finance in the western world, see Ferguson (2008) . For a recently updated review of the roots and dynamics of financial innovation, see Lerner and Tufano (2011) . On the role of competition and deregulation in FD, see Rajan and Zingales (2003) . Examples of theoretical and methodological breakthroughs that have dramatically influenced FD include double-entry bookkeeping, probability theory, life expectancy tables and actuarial science, and the Black-Scholes option theory. 7 governance), or somewhere in between (reflecting problems of incentives and \"skin in the game\" at some level of the monitoring pyramid). Failures to resolve participation frictions, although less discussed, are equally important. They are a routine occurrence in the less-developed financial systems and justify much of the state's catalytic and financial infrastructure-building role. But they may also happen in well-developed systems, particularly in the process of spreading risk. 11",

For example, agents may take positions expecting to free-ride on market liquidity-i.e., expecting to unwind their positions if needed at little or no cost. But market withdrawals in times of stress can unleash negative externalities as they may be individually optimal but socially harmful because of the systemic implications of fire sale spirals and self-fulfilling collapses in liquidity. 14 To the extent that agents do not internalize these externalities, they will take excessive risk (from a social viewpoint) in the tranquil times.",

Although domestic debt faces large returns to scale (implying a large size threshold and significant collective action frictions), it appears at a relatively early stage.

Bank deposit services initially expand in response to the early need for simple custodial and payment services. But banks have a harder time lending than attracting funds. As information gathering moves from relationship-based lending to arms-length finance, private credit rises along a convex path-it catches up with deposits over time and eventually exceeds retail funding as wholesale (non-deposit) funding makes up for the slack (Figure 4 ). Lending to other financial institutions follows private credit and is highly convex. These features are all related. As frictions ease up, retail investors are increasingly able to shift into higher yielding market instruments or to have their funds managed by asset managers or institutional investors rather than banks.

The late appearance of capital markets and the strong convexity of their development paths are of course clear manifestations of the complexity of both agency and collective action frictions. Remarkably, private (market) debt is another big outlier. It emerges late in the game despite limited returns to scale. This suggests that, unlike in the case of public debt whose growth is primarily constrained by critical mass effects, the growth of private debt is limited by information and enforcement frictions rather than by returns to scale-collective action frictions. On the other hand, the fact that corporate bonds develop after stocks is arguably because growing firms can initially substitute bank debt for market debt but will need at some point to issue stocks no matter what. 21 Institutional investors. They appear at very different stages of FD. Pension funds emerge early, mutual funds late; insurance arises somewhere in between, with non-life emerging earlier than life. That pension funds appear early reflects the key role played by policy, in the form of pension reforms. That mutual funds appear late despite not facing increasing returns to scale (i.e., not being constrained by market size) reflects the fact that the marketable, liquid assets-which mutual funds need to invest in-appear relatively late in the game. The later appearance of life over non-life insurance follows the same logic. The early emergence of non-life insurance is in part because it is influenced by policy, in the form of mandatory insurance for motor vehicles; the late appearance of life insurance can be explained by the later development of capital markets on which it depends. 22 Reflecting the need to invest in marketable assets and for life cohorts to interact inter-generationally, life insurance takes time to bloom; but once it does, it follows a steeply convex path.",

Similar features appear for financial globalization and the equity market turnover.

The broad predictions derived from this approach regarding the order of appearance, returns to scale and shape of developmental paths of various financial activities turned out to be generally satisfied. In particular, where activities are mostly hindered by participation frictions, development paths exhibit substantial convexities, as rising participation and interconnectedness generate positive externalities that promote further participation and interconnectedness.

This is exactly the conclusion that several recent papers reach when regressing output growth against financial depth indicators. 33 In this sense, finance resembles a luxury good; its use explodes as income rises, yet its benefits (whether in welfare or growth) should naturally exhibit falling marginal returns.

If collective action failures become more problematic in denser and more interconnected financial systems, the dark side of finance may well increase in intensity as income rises. Even if the intensity remained constant, instead of rising, the declining marginal benefits of financial development should eventually fall below the (rising or constant) marginal costs of financial instability. If so, the conclusion that finance will at some point become excessive would become inescapable. But the balance between the marginal costs and marginal benefits of finance will ultimately depend on the quality (and cost) of the policy response, as better policies could simultaneously limit the risks (and costs) of financial instability. This puts an increasing premium on good policies that keep the forces of the dark side in check as financial development deepens.

The creditor rights index and the credit information index are from Doing Business. The property rights index is from the Heritage Foundation. GDP growth is the average annual growth over the sample period.

Note: Logit estimations with country-fixed effects. Odds ratios are presented. A x% credit crash is defined as an x% annual drop in domestic private credit to GDP. Growth variables are calculated using 5year window moving averages. Pre-crash credit growth deviation is T-1 to T-3 growth minus T-6 to T-3 growth, where T denotes the year of the crash. Figure 2 .
