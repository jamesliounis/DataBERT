  "abstract": "Major economic, political and social changes have taken place in Central America over the past decade. These changes have led to improvements in well-being and reductions in rural poverty rates, but the region is still characterized by persistent and stark inequalities in assets and incomes and high numbers of poor persons in rural areas. This inequality is most evident in terms of landholdings, but other key productive, social and locational assets are also unequally distributed among households and geographical areas. The asset-based approach considers linkages between households' productive, social and locational assets; the policy, institutional and risk context; their behavior as expressed in livelihood strategies, and well-being outcomes. For sustainable poverty reducing growth, it is critical to examine household asset portfolios and understand how assets interact with the context to influence the selection of livelihood strategies, which in turn determine well-being. Policy reforms can change the context and income-generating potential of assets. Investments can add new assets or increase the efficiency of existing household assets, and also improve households' risk management capacity to protect assets. After all is said and done, a household's asset portfolio will determine whether growth and poverty reduction can be achieved and sustained over time. The asset-based framework is amenable to different analytical techniques. It is suggested to combine quantitative and qualitative spatial and household level analyses (and linked spatial and household level analyses) to deepen understanding of the complex relationships between assets, context, livelihood strategies and well-being outcomes.",

        "text": "The study, \"Identifying Drivers of Sustainable Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction,\" is part of ongoing efforts by the Central American Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development (CA ESSD) Department in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Region of the World Bank to strengthen analyses and strategies for rural development, and to address fundamental policy issues and investment priorities. One objective of this study is to develop an appropriate conceptual and analytical framework to understand how broad-based economic growth can be stimulated in rural Central America, and to apply the framework for country case studies. An asset-based approach has been adopted to guide the conceptual and analytical framework used for this study, whereby household assets are considered the \"drivers\" of growth. This paper provides an explanation of the asset-based conceptual framework, including a review of the literature. 1",

While these changes may have led to some improvements in well-being and reductions in rural poverty rates, the region is still characterized by persistent and stark inequalities in assets and incomes and high numbers of poor persons (Tejo 2000; Morley 2001; Sauma, 2002; Franko 2003; de Ferranti and others 2004) . Central American countries have long been characterized by dualistic agricultural sectors and pervasive rural poverty. Even though the Region has experienced significant urbanization, a significant share of the poor can be found in rural areas, while rural-urban migration continues to take place (Hereford and Echeverria 2003) 3 . Broad-based growth potential is constrained by unequal asset distribution. This inequality is most evident in terms of landholdings, but other key productive, social and locational assets are also unequally distributed among households and geographical areas (Attanasio and Szekeley 2001; de Janvry 2002) .",

        "text": "Policy reforms in the Central American countries led to new opportunities in the agricultural sector, especially for production of export commodities. In fact, agricultural growth in the 1990s was largely driven by increasing prices of key agricultural exports and land expansion. However, since the late 1990s, prices have fallen dramatically (notably coffee prices) and opportunities for land expansion have become more limited. Furthermore, there is not much optimism for sustained commodity price increases in the near future, with many commodities experiencing negative price trends (FAO 2002) . Thus agricultural growth rates have declined and there has been perception of a crisis in rural areas. The \"rural crisis\" in Central America (see Varangis and others 2003) has been compounded by natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch and recurring droughts that have increased vulnerability in agricultural-dependent rural areas (de Ferranti and others 2000; IADB 2000; Keipi and Tyson 2001; Kiesel 2001) . Increased market and trade liberalization and decentralization all have the potential to create conditions for growth over time, but these changes, including the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), further contribute to uncertainty in the short term.",

Many of these areas lack basic transport, communication and social infrastructure. Households in such areas have limited assets and livelihood opportunities. They tend to have lower levels of education, larger families, and strong communal traditions and cultural values that are not well understood in the context of the market economy. They produce for subsistence or the local market and are often net purchasers of food. Their productivity has not kept pace with other sectors of the economy, and many see migration as their best opportunity to escape poverty. Traditional policy and market-based reforms cannot quickly resolve decades of structural limitations facing the rural poor, including highly unequal access to productive and social infrastructure and unequal asset distributions.",

These actions, in turn, determine outcomes in terms of household well-being. 9 Of critical importance is the context, the policy and institutional milieu and the existence or absence of risks. The welfare-generating potential of assets depends on the interface between assets and the context. Thus policy reforms and the building of assets need to be considered in tandem, and integrated with risk management strategies (IADB 2000) . The asset-based approach is well-suited for understanding and analyzing rural poverty in Central America because of the Region's highly unequal distribution of assets among areas and households, high exposure to natural, economic and social risks, and the ongoing economic, political and institutional reforms.

That is, the location of poor households, their assets and assets at the community and local levels have been shaped by history. For example, the pervasiveness of rural poverty in the Central American countries and the location of poor rural households is largely the result of historical factors (see for example, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2000; Attanasio and Szekeley 2001; Morley 2001; Franko 2003; Plataforma Agraria 2003; World Bank 2002c) . Poverty Report 2001 (IFAD 2001 states that increasing access to assets is crucial for broad-based growth and poverty reduction. Assets take many forms -human and social (education, health, organizations), natural (land, water and forests), technological (farm production, processing and marketing materials), infrastructural (roads, communications, health and education facilities, housing) and financial (crop sales and off-farm revenue, investment and working capital, \"savings\" in the form of livestock and stored commodities). There is strong complementarity among assets categories. For example, building social capital by strengthening farmers' groups and improving road and communications networks can enhance the financial asset base. Secure land use rights can allow farmers to invest in technology, leading to higher farm productivity. They may then invest in improved health and nutrition and their children's education.\" (emphasis by author)",

We view them as parts of the system that protects property, not as interlocking mechanisms for fixing the economic potential of an asset in such a way that it can be converted into capital. What creates capital in the West, in other words, is an implicit process buried in the intricacies of its formal property systems (p. 45-46) .\"",

For example, coping strategies used by poor rural households can lead to the degradation or decapitalization of assets such as cutting down trees, taking children out of school and these actions can contribute to a cycle of poverty. Alternatively, household livelihood strategies can lead to improved asset portfolios such as investments in improved technology, training programs, empowerment in social and political networks that can lead to a virtuous cycle of sustainable growth. Asset accumulation and changes in livelihood strategies are important drivers for sustained improvements in well-being, and this study describes patterns of asset accumulation and livelihood strategies and investigates their causes.",

The paper is entitled: \"Rural Nonfarm Employment and Incomes in Latin America: Overview and Policy Implications\" (by Reardon, Berdegue, and Escobar (2001) :\u2022 There is a need to identify differentiated options for different households and zones because of heterogeneity in assets, context, and livelihood strategies. \u2022 Agricultural development might be a driver of rural development in some areas, but not in most poor rural areas. Non-agricultural activities are critical for successful agricultural development and improvements in well-being in marginal agricultural areas. \u2022 Despite new focus on importance of non-agricultural economic activities for rural growth and poverty reduction, it would be a mistake to transfer public resources that support agriculture such as research and extension) to non-agricultural activities. Instead, support for agriculture needs to increase and support to nonagricultural activities too. And synergies need to be identified. \u2022 Public institutions need to be restructured to facilitate multi-sectoral rural development efforts. Mandates for agricultural ministries tend to be too limited, while ministries for industry and commerce tend to be urban-oriented. \u2022 Agricultural development efforts and support services should also consider how to assist and integrate backward and forward linked activities. For example, the mandate for research and extension services needs to be expanded. \u2022 Policies to improve incentives in rural areas require complementary investments in capacity building to enable poor households to take advantage of the new opportunities. \u2022 A proactive public sector role is needed to assist poor rural areas to increase their attractiveness to the private sector such as investments in infrastructure and services, education and health. \u2022 Local governments need to be involved in the planning process, and the awarding of contracts, permits, and licenses that will encourage private sector development. \u2022 Investments in highway and secondary roads and in education are necessary for any rural development efforts and should be a priority. \u2022 Policies and programs to support rural women, indigenous groups, and others subject to explicit or implicit discrimination are needed, and there are many different ways that they can be helped to better integrate into, and benefit from, the rural economy.",
