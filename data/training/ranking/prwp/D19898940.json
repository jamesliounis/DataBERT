The widely-used identi\u2026cation method of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) in the context of structural vector-autoregressions models (SVAR), which relies on the existence of a one-quarter lag between output and a \u2026scal response, has been called into question by Ramey (2011) on the basis that what is an orthogonal shock for an SVAR may not be so for private forecasters. In other words, there seems to be, at least for the United States, a non-trivial correlation between orthogonal innovations in an SVAR and private forecasts. To remedy this, Barro and Redlick (2011) and Romer and Romer (2010) have suggested, respectively, the use of a \"natural experiment approach\"(military buildups in the United States) or a narrative approach for the case of taxes.",

In the same vein, since most expansionary policies take place during booms in developing countries (i.e., the well-known procyclical \u2026scal behavior), low multipliers in developing countries could re \u2021ect that such expansionary policies have low impact in booms. 2 There is thus reason to believe that, in both industrial and emerging countries, the size of \u2026scal multipliers could well depend on the economic cycle.",

A potential solution is the use of non-linear, regime-switching type regressions, which have been used in some studies for the United States and other industrial countries. Speci\u2026cally, Fazzari et al. (2012) extend Chan and Tong's (1986) early work on Threshold Autorregresive Models (TAR) to a multivariate setting in order to create a Threshold SVAR (TSVAR) model. In a TSVAR, the parameters are allowed to switch according to whether a threshold variable crosses an estimated threshold (capacity utilization in this case). A possible drawback of this methodology lies in the potential arbitrariness of the threshold selection. In Fazzari et al.",

        "text": "In a related, but di\u00a4erent, approach, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (AG) (2010) solve the issue of threshold selection by extending early work by Granger and Teravistra (1993) on Smooth Transition Autoregressive models (STAR) in order to accommodate simultaneous equation analysis in a Smooth Transition Vector Autoregressive model (STVAR). In this model the transition across states is controlled by an underlying smooth logistic distribution with a weight (or probability) given by a moving average of real GDP growth. For the United States, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2010) conclude that the spending multiplier is around zero in expansions and 1.5-2.0 in recessions. Using a linear model, the estimate would be around one, thus underestimating it for recessions and overestimating it for expansions. In Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) , they resort to an alternative methodology -advocated by Jorda (2005) and Stock and Watson (2007) -that relies on running a separate regression for each horizon and then constructing the impulse response function. This direct projection method does not impose the dynamic restrictions implicitly embedded in VARs and can easily accommodate non-linearities in the response function. They conclude, for a panel of OECD countries, that the multiplier is around 3.5 during recessions and essentially zero during expansions. This paper tackles the same question (do \u2026scal multipliers depend on the state of the business cycle?) but brings into the picture a new dimension, which we believe is critical for evaluating the size of \u2026scal multipliers in good and bad times. 3 The new dimension is whether government spending is going up or down. To understand intuitively why this may be a critical dimension, notice that when we talk about \u2026scal multipliers in good and bad times, the implicit world that we have in mind is one in which \u2026scal policy is countercyclical (i.e.., government spending increases in bad times and falls in good times), as has traditionally been the case for industrial countries. 4 As illustrated in Table 1 , however, this is not true about 44 percent of the time. 5 Speci\u2026cally, by combining good or bad times with government spending going up or down, Table 1 tells us how much time the economy spends, on average, in each of the possible four states of the world (top \u2026gures in every cell, which add up to 100 percent). For example, cell (1,1) indicates that industrial countries spend, on average, 29 percent of the time in good times with government spending going down. The table thus tells us that industrial countries spend, on average, 56 percent of the time in countercyclical states of the world; that is, the sum of cells (1,1) and (2, 2) . The rest of the time (44 percent), government spending is either going down in bad times (cell (2,1)) or going up in good times (cell (1,2)), which would constitute procyclical \u2026scal policy.",

The corresponding \u2026gures for a typical and extreme expansion are 1.6 and 7.7 percent, respectively. As will become clear below, important policy implications will arise from comparing typical and extreme business cycle conditions, particularly regarding (i) the expansionary e\u00a4ect of government spending under alternative recessionary environments, and (ii) how the e\u00a4ectiveness of austerity packages may crucially depend upon the severity of the recessionary environment.One of the main novelties of this paper is to assess potential asymmetric e\u00a4ects on output of government spending depending on whether government spending is increasing or decreasing.Before interacting this new dimension with the stance of the business cycle, we \u2026rst evaluate in Section 3.3 whether the size of the \u2026scal multiplier may depend on whether government spending is going up or down (without considering the stance of the business cycle).

Interestingly enough, we \u2026nd that the \u2026scal multiplier associated with increases in government spending is larger than the one associated with decreases in government spending. In fact, the multiplier for government spending increases is 0.48 on impact (and signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero) and reaches a maximum of about 1.36 after four semesters. In sharp contrast, the multiplier when government spending falls is never signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero.When comparing these multipliers to the ones obtained in section 3.2, interesting similarities emerge. The pro\u2026le obtained for the \u2026scal multiplier in periods of expansion(Figure 2, panel A) is similar to the \u2026scal multiplier associated with decreases in government spending(Figure 4, panel A). Both multipliers are not signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero. By the same token, the pro\u2026le obtained for the \u2026scal multiplier in recessions(Figure 2, panel B)is similar to the \u2026scal multipliers associated with increases in government spending(Figure 4, panel B).Both \u2026scal multipliers have initial values that are less than 1 (but signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero) and long-run values that are larger than 1.A somewhat di\u00a4erent pictures emerges for developing countries. The multiplier when government spending goes up (Figure 5, panel B)is barely signi\u2026cant on impact, reaches a peak of 0.64 after 3 quarters but becomes insigni\u2026cant after around 4 quarters.
