This is the reason why the assurance from the European Central Bank (ECB) in July 2012 that it was prepared to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro boosted morale and markets. It led to a sense that the sovereign debt of an individual nation, however small, within the Eurozone area, had an assurance that went beyond the boundaries of the nation.",

Indeed, there is an increasing realization now that the ECB may want to do \"whatever it takes\", but will actually do \"whatever is possible,\" and there are severe limits to what is possible. This was explicitly stated in Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe in June 2013, when the Bundesbank questioned the ECB's open-ended offer to buy sovereign bonds of nations at risk of default. Some of this skepticism about the extent to which the ECB or any nation can reach out to rescue another nation in the Eurozone caught up in the sovereign debt crisis is valid because of the restrictions placed on such action in the Treaty of Lisbon, and the earlier Treaty of Maastricht. We are referring, in particular, to articles in Treaty which explicitly prohibit one nation from taking on the debt liability of another nation and also prevent European Central Bank from directly purchasing bonds issued by Eurozone sovereigns.",

        "text": "At a more general level this paper is concerned with international policy coordinationthough in the model attention is restricted to a special case of this, to wit, one involving banking, investment and sovereign debt. 1 These cannot always be left to natural market forces and may require deliberate, global policy intervention. The ongoing global economic crisis points to this. It was realized in the seventeenth century that a single economy cannot afford to have multiple money-creating authorities and central banks, ranging from the Riksbank in Sweden to the Bank of England, were born of this realization. However, with globalization the world has gradually drifted towards a single economy. This has meant that in some ways we have moved back to our predicament three hundred years ago when we had many money creating authorities operating within each economy. 2 Since the world is not about to move to a single monetary authority (the travails of Europe has set such an agenda even further back) the need is to have greater coordination across central banks. Much can be gained by creating a consortium of major nations, cutting across rich and poor nations, that can achieve a modicum of coordination in monetary and macroeconomic policies. Our paper is not about this broader coordination, but rather a more limited contractual approach, involving a Pareto improvement that can be achieved among three countries, but entailing only bilateral agreements.",

A few months ago, we saw the reactions and risks of currency war arising from Bank of Japan's open adoption of quantitative easing to boost domestic demand and also to counter the large appreciation of the yen that had occurred over the previous six to ten years. We witnessed a similar experience of volatility in response to announcements that the US Fed is beginning to consider the withdrawal of its policy of quantitative easing, currently taking the form of asset purchases worth US$ 85 billion every month. These announcements caused yields on 10-year Treasuries to rise sharply and that, in turn, gave rise to volatility in exchange rates in emerging market economies, with sharp depreciations in the South African rand, the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee, the Mexican peso and several other currencies.",

The aim of this paper is to illustrate one which is of great contemporary relevance by using tools of modern theoretical economics. The current global situation is precarious and, though there are signs of calm in certain financial indicators such as sovereign bond yields and borrowing costs of troubled European economies such as Spain and Italy, in real terms the situation remains grave with unemployment at unsustainably high levels in Europe. Even in the US, where unemployment is lower-at 7.6%, as we write-the details underlying this figure are worrying. More than one third of those unemployed are long-term unemployed, which inflicts great suffering on them and also causes deskilling of the labor force with deleterious long-term effects on the economy. Also, indicators of efficiency in the labor market such as turnover rates and quit rates are at very low levels. We point to these to stress the need for out of the box thinking on the policy front.",

        "text": "What may require a little special explanation is the use in this paper of pure economic theory to address a problem of pure economic policy. We believe that while there is a huge need for evidence-based policy-making, there is reason to be alarmed by the ubiquity of evidence-based and reason-free analysis that one sees in the world. Such analyses can easily lead us to non-sequiturs. Take one empirical argument often used to make the case for free trade, namely, that there is no economy in the world that is totally closed and has grown. What proponents of this argument miss out on is the fact that the world as a whole is a completely closed economy and has grown. To peg the case for free trade on such a purelyempirical argument is to risk its collapse, as happens in this case. 3 Fortunately, the case for freer trade does not have to rely on such a purely empirical argument. There are many other areas where great strides and quick strides can be made by being more open to theory than the policy world has been. Pythagoras would have been hugely inefficient if he had tried to establish the theorem on right-angled triangles by collecting such triangles from around the world and measuring the areas around them, and that would be so even if he were fastidious in drawing the sample of his triangles by a strict randomization from the universe of all right-angled triangles.",

There is mounting evidence that the costs on the defaulting nation are huge and prolonged (see, for instance, Cruces and Trebesch, 2011) .

See also Bolton and Jeanne (2011) . its so-called \"no bail-out clause.\" This clearly fed into Eurozone's sovereign debt problem (Pisani-Ferry, Sapir and Wolff, 2013) . Actually, this hurdle was already there in advance of the Lisbon Treaty, which came into force only on December 1, 2009, in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. Relatedly, Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits direct credit from the central bank to any sovereign and also disallows the purchase of government bonds from the primary market. 10 As a consequence of this the ECB is not a lender of last resort 11 to any government but only to banks (Schafer, 2012) . This has played a major role in the arguing for is the Treaty to be amended to permit the latter. The paper does not go into institutional details of how this may be done but constructs a theoretical model to motivate such a legal-institutional change. Regarding the scope for monetization of sovereign debt, there is a case for improving the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty but that is not central to the model in this paper. Moreover, we are not dealing with the debt legacy problem of the Eurozone economies, which is enormous but needs to be dealt with using other instruments.",

(Arnott and Stiglitz, 1991) . 1213 The theory of peer monitoring associated with joint liability among a group of borrowers has provided micro-foundations for the success of micro-finance, but the incentive to co-sign the loan is simpler than here: individuals simply can't get the loan without an agreement to co-sign, and co-signing then provides the incentive to monitor.

If one shows (as we will in this paper) that people can do better by behaving differently, mainstream economists are prone to argue that that there must be a flaw in the analysis because if people could have done better behaving differently (e.g. by signing these contracts), then they would already be doing so. This mainstream criticism has to be false because otherwise it would be unclear why human beings waited till the 18th century to develop the small pox vaccine, 19th century to have cars, 20th century to have computers and 21st century for Skype. This is because a new invention is, in the end, nothing but the discovery of high returns associated with new behaviors. What we need to understand is that our deficiency of knowledge can extend to strategies of action. 16 There are social and behavioral innovations just like technological innovations; and just as technological innovations rely on inventions and discoveries so do social and behavioral innovations. The aim of this paper is to outline new strategies that can make international lending across nations that are inter-connected, such as the current European Union nations, more efficient and robust.",

        "text": "Before going into the construction of the formal model, it may be useful to sketch out the argument in words. A small country, such as Cyprus, needs a loan of B from an international Bank to build a power station and promises to pay back the amount borrowed with whatever interest is agreed upon. There is however a sub-text to the promise. If the project fails, Cyprus will be unable to pay back the Bank. This could be because of a limited liability arrangement but it can also be simply a matter of the reality of not being able to enforce the debt contract. Formal limited liability is rare in international credit, which actually makes matters worse. There are analysts who have rightly called for a formal sovereign debt reduction procedure which is comparable to Chapter 11 of the US corporate bankruptcy code. 17 The country may be too small and poor to be able to pay this back in the event of the project failing. This introduces a standard moral hazard problem. 18 Suppose the probability of success depends on the effort that Cyprus puts in to the power project. It can be shown that one consequence of the de facto limited liability is that Cyprus will put in less effort than is \"efficient,\" in the sense of maximizing the value of (global) output. 19 And this raises the question, is there a design that can recover this lost efficiency? The answer is yes, if certain conditions are fulfilled. The essential condition is that there exists a wealthy and powerful nation with which Cyprus has close economic ties-they may be trading and business partners-and that this partner can observe Cyprus's behavior. Suppose there is such a nation, k-think Germany-that has this attribute. This is a nation that has close connections with Cyprus maybe because they are both part of a currency union or trading union and so have regular trade and business inter-connectivity.",

Of course, it may be possible that in Courts to which i and j submit themselves, e is not observable, but e is observable in courts to which k and j submit themselves.

There is no analysis of the consequences to the members of the group from reneging on their promise to behave well (other than the implicit cost of not being able to get access to future micro-finance. The value of this access is sufficiently high that it is assumed that members of the group will not renege.) More recent literature has formalized this \"value of access\". Still more recently,Haldar and Stiglitz (2013) have argued that good behavior is motivated not just by the value of access, but by the social obligations (\"social capital\") that is built up as part of the lending program. For a more recent discussion of joint liability in lending, seeGhatak and Guinnane (1999).15 There is a related concept in which bank monitoring (not quite a peer) provides information to capital markets, where monitoring is weak. Efficiently capital markets free ride off of banking monitoring in a way similar to the situation here. It is not that the bank guarantees the capital market loan, but cross default clauses/covenants can be designed to exploit the banks superior information and incentives. (SeeStiglitz 1992)",
