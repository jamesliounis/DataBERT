Agricultural supply, mainly in the form of area expansion, affects the environment as it leads to the reduction of natural habitat (through deforestation or shrinkage of vegetation area), erosion (i.e., soil exposure to water and wind erosion), sedimentation and soil degradation.

The most influential model is the Nerlove model, a dynamic supply model that was originally developed in the context of crop-by-crop supply response (see Nerlove, 1958) . Basically, the model states that output (quantity or area) is a function of expected price, output (area) adjustment and some exogenous variables. Subsequent modifications attempt to capture the specificity of the crop under investigation, \"alternative crops that compete for land and labor, the inclusion of other factors of particular importance for the country or crop being investigated, and the time horizon that must be considered for each crop \" (Bond, 1983, p.709) .",

Hence, input prices are a very important element of agricultural production. The prices of the following inputs are particularly relevant: fertilizers, pesticides, improved and high yield varieties of seeds, tractors and cars. Moreover, urban wages and the price of consumer goods have a serious impact on agricultural output prices. An increase in input prices increases input costs and decreases the incentive to produce more, ceteris paribus. This is generally the case for external inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, improved and high yield varieties of seed and machinery which, as imported goods, at least in many LDCs, see their prices raised by policies that protect industry. On the other hand, in many countries there is a fair amount of subsidization of these inputs as in the case of an overvaluation of currency which artificially reduces the cost of imported inputs. This brings about an overuse of these inputs which most likely leads to inefficiency over time and may well create environmental problems. Apart from that, some of the inputs may have a negative effect in the long-run even when they become available to rural dwellers at low cost. For example, some pesticides can bring about health problems which impinge on future productivity or might result in death. The prices of consumer goods are important to the extent that they enter the consumer price index. As the relevant output price incentive is the real output price (generally, nominal price over some consumer price index), an increase in the price of consumer goods brings about a decrease in real output price which in turn constitutes a disincentive to produce more.

The implicit idea is that a price increase and a price decrease lead to the same output change (in absolute value). The agricultural supply in this sense is said to be symrnetric or reversible, as a price decrease will bring the supply at its original level. In reality, the fact that \"fixed assets\" or precisely, \"sticky assets\" such as land, trees, buildings or equipment that were acquired when prices were high, are not thrown away when the prices are low, at least in the short-run, implies that price increase and price decrease do not give rise to a similar change in output (Johnson, 1958) . This is particularly true for perennial crops; the output change resulting from price decrease is less than that from price increase. The supply response is then said to be irreversible or asymmetric. Technological innovation can also explain this phenomenon (Cochrane, 1955) . Indeed, \"an increase in price induces farmers to adopt technologically improved production methods, and they hold on to these improved production practices even when the price of the commodity falls. This is, because, by definition, a technological advance reduces unit costs, and unit costs are lower with the improved production practice than without it no matter what the price of the product is. Some resources used in the production of the crop will be shifted to the production of other crops when its price declines, but during the price fall, the rate of decline in the supply of the crop will be less than the increase in the supply of the crop when the price rises\" (Jaforullah, 1993, p.490 ).",

If one agrees with equality (4) or (4'), then nominal protection coefficient does not fully capture real producer price. Concerning exchange rates, with the exceptions of Cleaver (1985) in one of his models, Jaeger (1992) and Pick and Vollrath (1994) , all authors do not include exchange rates in their set of explanatory variables. This is mainly explained by equality (4) or (4') which basically states that the real producer price already contains information on the real exchange rate. Thus, Jaeger (1992) who uses simultaneously real effective exchange rates and real producer prices along with disaster variable and weather to explain agricultural exports at the aggregate as well as the individual crop level, is rather suspicious. This may well explain why he obtains from time to time a wrong sign for the impact of exchange rate (i.e., an appreciation of real effective exchange rate of 100% gives rise to a 33% increase in-the agricultural exports of annual crop exporter countries) or an insignificant real producer price (this is the case for tree crop exporter countries 17 ). In his framework, the simultaneous inclusion of the two variables can be justifiable if one variable is cleaned up for the effect of the other. Pick and Vollrath's study seems fine since it captures real exchange rate by misalignment and real output price by nominal export price. The use of real currency depreciation in Cleaver (1985) would be fine if combined with other missing variables in (4').",

Binswanger et al. (1987) address the issue of simultaneity by deriving output and factor demands (fertilizers and urban wages) from profit maximization. In our view, most of the explanatory variables in their model are truly endogenous (irrigation, roads, research, population growth). MIost likely, population growth in Cleaver's model is endogenous.

Worse, in some countries fertilizers are subsidized. Certainly, results are sensitive to the definition of variables adopted. For example, in attempting to explain Peterson's high elasticity, Binswanger et al. (1985) find that by using prices based on the iMultilateral Fisher Index coupled with purchasing power currency, Peterson's elasticity falls in the range 0.02 to 0.45 instead of 1.27 to 1.65. Cleaver (1985) uses the nominal protection coefficient or the currency depreciation rate. But as seen above, if the NPC is defined as the ratio of farmgate price to the product of foreign price times nominal exchange rate, then direct comparability becomes a problem as some nominal exchange rates are distorted in some countries. The real protection coefficient defined from the equilibrium exchange rate is more appropriate in this framework. This remark is also addressed to Cleaver and Schreiber (1994) . Jaeger (1992) defines real producer price as the ratio of nominal producer price to consumer price index. The problem is that consumer price index is not directly comparable across countries for reasons advocated above. Instead of the consumer price index, some measurement based on purchasing power currency a la Summers-Heston is preferable. For the same reason, comparability of real effective exchange rate is problematical as it is based on consumer price index.",

Maitha (1969) estimates the area response for Kenyan coffee that depends on real producer price (Fisher lag: 1 to 4), lagged quantity of coffee, a dummy variable and a time trend. Frederick (1969) explains cotton area expansion by the relative price of cotton to price of coffee lagged one period (the two prices are also used separately in one regression) and a time trend. Seini's (1985) final model of cotton area contains nominal lagged cotton price, lagged groundnut price and lagged area. Kere et al. (1986) regress acreage under wheat on the price of wheat (nominal or deflated by the price of the most competing crop) lagged one period, lagged yield of wheat, monthly rainfall and a time trend. Binswanger et al. (1987) use price of crop output, price of livestock, price of fertilizers, urban wages, irrigation, road density, roads paved, life expectancy, adult literacy, research, extension, GDP, rural density and country dummies to explain crop area (defined as the sum of harvested area of individual crops as reported by FAO). Gunawardana and Oczkowski (1992) have paddy area that depends on price ratio (paddy/fertilizer), irrigation, credit, concessional sales of rice, and area lagged. Olayemi and Oni (1972) is the only study that deals with an asymrnetry in price response for Sub-Saharan Africa. The objective is to assess how Western Nigerian cocoa farmers respond to different scenarios of price changes. The information collected from field interviews allows to run two types of regression: cocoa acreage on rising price and cocoa acreage on falling price. Trail et al. (1978) is a study on asymmetric area response to price changes applied to the United States Late Summer onion crop. The authors compare the symmetric supply response with the irreversible supply response captured by the two versions of the Wolffran technique presented above. Jaforullah (1993) exploits the asymmetric supply framework to explain sugar cane supply in the mill zones of Bangladesh over the period 1947-81. The variables of interest are: lagged area, price of sugar cane per hectare relative to that of jute, yield of sugar cane relative to that of jute, relative risk of sugar cane to jute, and two dummy variables (one reflecting the opening up of new sugar cane rnills in the planted area of sugar cane and the other the effect of government ban on the production of jute in the mills zone). Table 3 in the appendix reports the results of the inquiry. The findings underlined in the previous part are uncovered here. Particularly, short run elasticities are low; longrun price elasticities are higher than short-run price elasticities. The novelty here is that the few studies using the asymmetric approach seem to reveal asymmetric area responses to price changes with area responding more to rising price than to falling price. In brief, area expansion responds to agricultural incentives.",

Put another way, \"the main obstacle to sustainable agricultural development is the failure of any economic policy, whether promoting food crops or exports, to address adequately problems of natural resource management. Policies to achieve food self-sufficiency may therefore be neither inherently more nor inherently less environmentally sustainable than export-oriented agricultural development \" (Barbier, 1989, p. 879 ).",

A host of policy variables (i.e., overvalued currency and budget deficit) and other factors (i.e., climate, quality of soil, level of technology) that also affect the level of agricultural supply can, under some circumstances, reinforce, decrease or annihilate the price effect. A deficient infrastructure, for example, as is the case in many third world countries, can wipe out the price incentive to produce more.",

Indeed, issues such as simultaneity bias, omitted variable bias, inaccurate data pooling, and asymmetry in supply responses to price changes have not been adequately addressed in many instances.

To corroborate, in terms of land degradation the environmental impact of agriculture can go either way because increasing agricultural output can be attained in several ways (i.e., intensification or extensification). While intensification is in principle not too harmful to the environment, at least in terms of land degradation, the outcome concerning extensification depends much on the way \"in which extra cultivation has been carried out \"(see Barbier and Burgess, 1992, p.3) . Moreover, since the interaction among explanatory variables becomes quite complex, few stylized facts can be drawn here. It means that agricultural price incentive can be positively or negatively correlated to land alteration; all depends, in great part, on the behavior of other variables with which it is correlated and the initial quality of soil. Nevertheless, in many LDCs in general and African countries in particular, it is probably right to say that land degradation is the most dominant outcome since most agricultural output has been obtained by clearing forest and/or opening up marginal areas.",

There is probably a certain amount of misspecification bias due to the omission of important variables such as life expectancy, adult literacy and irrigation that have changed over time. For example, by adding irrigation inPeterson's model, Chhibber   (1989)  finds that the price elasticity passes from 1.27 to 0.97.Cleaver (1985) contains some misspecification problems. It is known that weather changes, as well as land quality, in Africa are quite important in explaining agricultural growth. Another problem of misspecification is that the nominal protection coefficient or the currency depreciation rate used by the author only captures part of the real producer price. Indeed, as definition (4) or (4') shows, if one uses nominal protection coefficient, then two other variables are left out: real exchange rate and real foreign price. If one uses currency depreciation rate, then nominal protection coefficient and real foreign price are left out.Life expectancy, income, roads (density and quality), research, extension, soil quality, population growth and country dummy variables are important explanatory variables that can be included inJaeger (1992).Lopez, All and Larsen (1991)  explain agricultural export supply in Malawi and Tanzania by the price of agricultural exportables, the price of agricultural nontradeables, the wage rate, an index of weather and an index of technical change. All the prices are normalized by the price of agricultural importables. Population growth (or density),",

Missing variables in this framewvork may include roads, human capital and population growth. As for the previous study, the high R 2 may be explained by the inclusion of lagged variables. C'leaver and Schreiber (1994) fail to consider in their models, amnong others, population growth, population density and life expectancy. Moreover, as underlined above, another source of rnisspecification originates from the use of nomninal protection coefficient instead of real producer prices; that is, some exchange rate variable and real foreign price are mnissing. Note that some of the high Rmnay be due to the presence of country dummy variables.Pick and Vollrath (1994) contain some omnitted variables in some equations (i.e., human capital). The models wvith severe omnitted variables show up with low R 2 . This is the case for Nigeria (0.36).As underlined implicitly above, there is some difficulty in evaluating the Nerlove model in terms of omitted variable misspecification. Lagged output (or area) usually explains a great part of variation of output (large contribution to R 2 ) Yet the inclusion of lagged output and time trend do not give us the impact of several variables of interest.",

Misspecified reversible function gives rise to an elasticity of 0.12 and 0.28 in the short-run and long-run, respectively.The results from asymmetric area responses are important in the debate concerning the potential deleterious environmental effect of price increases and price decreases.3.2.2. Export crop production versus food crop production' 9\"Higher aggregate crop prices and lower agricultural costs increase the profitability of crop production, thus encouraging an aggregate expansion of agricultural production through either agricultural intensification or extensification; the impact of agricultural pricing on the relative returns to agricultural production can influence long-run decisions to invest in sustainable land management and conservation; changes in the relative prices of crops (and crop inputs) can influence the substitution of more environmentally benign cropping and farm production systems for systems that are more environmentally damaging; the variability of crop prices and crop price inputs can affect the farmers' choice of the method and type of crops grown, and decisions to invest in sustainable land management, by affectincg the risk associated with alternative agricultural",
