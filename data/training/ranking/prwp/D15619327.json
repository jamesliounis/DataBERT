        "text": "Although the financial crisis of 2008 officially came to an end in the United States in June 2009 2 , its repercussions continue to be felt across the globe. In many advanced economies, industrial production lingers below pre-crisis levels. Unemployment remains stubbornly high and balance sheets of governments, European financial institutions and U.S. households continue to be weak. In continental Europe's highly-indebted economies, a crisis of confidence has led to plummeting stock markets and widening spreads. Signs of vulnerability are also surging in emerging market economies. The anxiety over a weak global growth outlook is rising. World growth is expected to slow down from 4 percent in 2010 to around 2.5 percent through 2012, as growth in advanced economies is projected to contract (World Bank 2012). The combination of excess capacity, low returns on investment, high risks and lower growth in advanced economies has been referred to as the -new normal.\u2016 3 If this -new normal\u2016 becomes entrenched, several advanced countries may face a lost decade 4 -with negative consequences for the entire world.",

With a looming public debt crisis in Europe and high public debt levels in the U.S., the private sector should ideally become the driver of growth; however, as long as excess capacity persists and investment risks remain high, private sector investment is likely to remain subdued. In order to reduce debt levels, many governments have turned their attention to implementing austerity measures and structural reforms, but austerity measures bear the danger of further weakening growth and worsening unemployment. Structural reforms, while key to boosting growth in the medium term, will only gain traction once demand increases. This raises the question of how governments can support demand and employment without adding further to debt levels in the medium run. Investments in green technology, education, and infrastructure come to mind. Under current economic circumstances, however, investing in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure projects that are selffinancing may be the best option. Infrastructure investments create jobs in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, which have been hit hard by the crisis, while also enhancing countries' future competitiveness and growth. In addition, countries could explore innovative 3 financing mechanisms to bring in the private sector and minimize the impact of these investments on the public debt burden.",

Opportunities for investing in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure are limited in advanced economies, which on average tend to already have rather well developed infrastructure. As discussed below, infrastructure needs in developing countries are large and lack of infrastructure is often a key bottleneck to growth. Since infrastructure projects require capital goods, many of which are produced in advanced economies, infrastructure investments in developing countries would also support the manufacturing sector in advanced economies. In addition, as growth in developing countries is lifted, their demand for products produced in advanced economies would increase further, possibly triggering a virtuous circle of mutually reinforcing growth.",

First, instead of increasing government spending in times of crisis -by digging a hole and filling a hole,\u2016 it emphasizes that any growth-lifting solution should focus on implementing bottleneck-releasing investments which will not only increase demand in the short-term but also raise longer term growth prospects. Second, the traditional Keynesian stimulus directs spending toward the domestic economy, while this proposal recommends a globally coordinated investment initiative. Finally, a global infrastructure initiative would not necessarily be financed through additional government spending. The government could, however, use existing financial resources, technical assistance and improvements in policies and the institutional environment to make infrastructure projects more attractive for private investors.",

        "text": "More than three years after the start of the Great Recession, manufacturing production in the United States and major European countries, with the exception of Germany, has not yet been restored to pre-crisis levels (see Figure 1 ). Unemployment remains persistently high in the U.S. and continues to increase in the Euro zone (see Figure 2 ). These high unemployment rates are putting pressure on government budgets. In the U.S., unemployment aid increased four-fold between 2007 and 2009, climbing from 0.24 percent of GDP to nearly 1 percent of GDP. In Spain, fiscal expenses of the general government related to social benefits in terms of GDP climbed from 15.1 percent in 2008 to 18.1 in 2010. High unemployment rates are also reducing household incomes, weakening demand, and eroding the tax base. As tax revenues fell, social expenditures climbed and governments tried to stem the crisis by recapitalizing financial institutions and stimulating demand, sovereign debt levels in the U.S. and several European countries reached levels that raise concerns about their financial stability. At the same time, private investment has been falling. In countries where unemployment rates increased steeply, housing prices have been falling, weakening household balance sheets even further. This effect was particularly pronounced in the U.S. where the burst of the housing bubble in 2008 triggered a vicious cycle with foreclosures, falling housing prices, and reduced household spending. Private investment fell steeply, largely driven by a decline in residential investments, but given the persistent excess capacity, non-residential investment also remains weak (see Figure 2 ). Similarly, private investment in Europe has fallen. Good private investment opportunities are hard to find when factories continue to carry spare capacity and office buildings remain vacant. 6%   8%   10%   12%   14%   16%   18%   0%   2%   4%   6%   8%   10%   12%   00q1  00q4  01q3  02q2  03q1  03q4  04q3  05q2  06q1  06q4  07q3  08q2  09q1  09q4  10q3  11q2 Unemployment rate (left) Private Investment -Nonresidential (in% of GDP, right) Private Investment -Total (in % of GDP, right)",

In a liquidity trap, monetary expansion works mainly through affecting inflationary expectations. If people do not perceive the expansion as a change in policy that will persist even after the economy has recovered, however, then even big changes in the monetary base will have little effect on the real economy (Woodford 2011) . To make things worse, fears of inflation may even prompt some high-income countries to tighten their monetary policy. This could lead to further financial stress as interest rates and re-financing costs could rise and both banks and firms may find their balance sheets under renewed pressure, bearing the danger that hidden vulnerabilities may be exposed (World Bank 2011a).",

Since infrastructure projects use capital goods, such as turbines and excavators, they generate indirectly jobs in the manufacturing sector. This direct and indirect employment raises household incomes and consumption, which can create additional (induced) jobs. For the U.S., it has been estimated that infrastructure for energy, transportation, public schools, and water systems will create 18,000 total jobs for every US$1 billion in new investment spending, of which about 40 percent will be in the construction sector (Heintz, Pollin, and Garrett-Peltier 2009 Here, infrastructure investments refer to new investments and maintenance. The authors assume that for roads, for example, about 43 percent of public investment in roads went to expand the system and 57 percent toward maintenance. Estimates from the U.S. Highway Administration (2006) are even higher: they find that US$1billion in road construction generates a total of 27,840 jobs, of which are created 6,055 on site and 7,790 related to the manufacturing of equipment. This implies that about 14,000 jobs would be created through multiplier effects. 7 Heintz, Pollin, and Garrett-Peltier (2009) state that US$1 billion infrastructure investment in either energy, transportation, school buildings, or water creates 16,763, 18,930, 19,262 and 19 ,769 total jobs, respectively. They find that the highest direct and indirect employment impacts are associated with investments in mass transit systems. 8 For a detailed discussion, see Schwartz, Andres, and Dragoiu (2009) . 9 The OECD (2006) estimates that global annual investment in telecommunications, land transport, water, and electricity will average 3.5 percent of GDP or approximately US$2 trillion in 2009 prices for OECD countries. world with respect to its infrastructure and 5 th with respect to its overall competitiveness, down from its 1 st place rank in 2005.",

These types of investments are not necessarily shovel-ready, requiring the government to make tough choices between speedy disbursements of funds and a more medium-term investment horizon aimed at optimizing the impact of the infrastructure projects. Japan's lost decade tells a cautionary tale. The burst of the Japanese financial and real estate bubbles at the beginning of the 1990s was followed by a decade of sluggish growth. The Japanese government implemented a series of stimulus packages to build roads and bridges and cut interest rates to near zero by 1995. But many of these programs did not produce large economic returns, investment multipliers were low, and growth remained subdued (Krugman 2009 ) due to the near saturation of many types of infrastructure in Japan. Maximizing the economic impact may also require combining infrastructure investments with investment in other types of capital, such as human capital, to increase the impact on productivity growth. In addition, since many infrastructure projects are financed and implemented at the sub-national government level, a successful implementation strategy would need to be coordinated across different levels of government (OECD 2011).",

Admittedly, empirical evidence on fiscal multipliers is mixed. Most studies ignore the state of the economy and do not distinguish between investment and consumption spending. Data on temporary, deficit-financed increases of government purchases in the U.S. yields estimates of multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 (Ramey 2011). However, multipliers are likely to be larger in recessions. Taking the state of the economy into account can lead to very different results (Parker 2011) . Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) , for example, show that the government spending multiplier can be in excess of three when the interest rate is held constant, such as at a zero lower bound in a model with sticky prices. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2010) use a nonlinear VAR structure, which allows the estimation of multipliers that differ in recession and in expansion. They find that the cumulative impact of multipliers over five years is higher during the recession, ranging from 1 to 1.5 (versus 0 to 0.5 during boom periods).",

First, the institutional context may affect returns of different types of infrastructure projects differently. Second, as a result of decentralization waves in many developing countries, revenue and expenditure assignments related to infrastructure spending have been pushed to lower levels of government. This requires a comprehensive alignment of fiscal responsibility and accountability, but also coordination in terms of project selection. Third, regional integration could significantly help in reducing infrastructure costs and improving access to regional and global markets. Benefits from exploiting large economies of scale in ports, airports, or power generation and transmission could be reaped through enhanced regional cooperation (World Bank 2009). In Africa, for example, regional power trading could reduce energy costs by US$2 billion and carbon emissions by 70 million tons annually (Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia 2010) . Fourth, the long-term growth impact of infrastructure investments may be mitigated if they lead to significant environmental damages. Fossil fuel energy generation, for example, can create emissions that contribute to acid rain and global warming. Irrigation works can lead to overuse of water, land degradation, and water pollution. In total, environmental costs associated with infrastructure investments have been estimated to reach 4 to 8 percent of GDP for some developing countries (World Bank 2007).

In many developing countries, the tax base is low, tax administration weak and increases in taxation can be highly distortionary. Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia (2010) argue that -each dollar raised spent by a Sub-Saharan African government has a marginal cost of public funds of almost 20 percent\u2016. Moreover, if infrastructure financing leads to a crowding out of private sector investment whether through -excessive\u2016 levels of taxation or increases in interest rates, its impact on growth will be diminished. In addition, the fiscal space to invest in infrastructure has narrowed for some emerging market economies in the wake of the financial crisis. Still, some governments could make strides in closing the infrastructure gap by spending existing resources more efficiently. The World Bank 2011aestimates that more than 11 percent of electricity and about 24-50 percent of water is unaccounted for in developing countries. In Africa, as much as US$17 billion out of an overall spending need of about US$93 billion could be met, if existing resources were used more effectively. Steps to enhance efficiency include safeguarding maintenance spending, improving the performance of utilities and other service providers, addressing deficiency in public expenditure frameworks, and modernizing administrative and regulatory frameworks (Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia 2010) . Africa by these countries through economic agencies jumped from US$1 billion per year in the early 2000s to around US$8 billion in 2006 (Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia 2010) . These investments tend often to be targeted to natural resource rich economies. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) from some of these countries have also started to invest in infrastructure. 32 Overall, SWFs are estimated to hold more than US$3.2 trillion in financial assets at the end of 2008 (Klitzing, Lin, Lund, and Nordin 2010) .

In the context of the current economic turmoil, investment opportunities that were once deemed safe and attractive may be losing their appeal, which has the potential to make investments in infrastructure in developing countries more desirable for long-term investors. In addition, many developing 32 Examples include the China-Africa Development Fund, an equity fund that invests in Chinese enterprises with operations in Africa, which reportedly invested nearly US$540 million in 27 projects in Africa that were expected to lead to total investments of US$3.6 billion in 2010. Furthermore, the Qatar Investment Authority plans to invest US$400 million in infrastructure in South Africa (Klitzing, Lin, Lund, and Nordin 2010) . Figure 6 ). Excluding the top recipients of private sector investments in infrastructure Brazil, China, India, Russia and Turkey, private investment commitments actually fell by around 30 percent between 2007 and 2010 as a result of the financial crisis and the number of countries attracting private sector involvement has reached its lowest level since the beginning of the early 1990s. As risk aversion has increased, investors are now seeking lower debt/equity ratios, shorter tenors, and higher overall expected rates of return (Izaguirre 2010) . Moreover, total private sector financing going to infrastructure investments in developing countries is still small at the global scale. This raises question which steps countries would need to undertake to increase the appeal of PPPs in developing countries for investors. 59. Even more promising than guarantees that diversify risks, albeit at a cost, is the possibility of actually reducing the risk. This can span a wide range of actions, including improving the regulatory framework and implementing sound macroeconomic policy. In economies with high country risks, investors in infrastructure often ask for real returns on equity in the order of 20 percent or more and a country risk premium of up to 5 percent on debt (Klein 2005) . Similarly, Guasch (2004) shows that regulatory risks to investments in Latin America can add up to 6 percent to the cost of capital. Analyzing credit spreads of infrastructure bonds, Dailami and Hauswald (2003) find that projects located in host countries with a stronger legal framework have lower funding costs and tighter spreads. And sustained macroeconomic stability is a key for earning an investment grade rating, which is essential to tap the large savings of institutional investors at attractive prices. Multilateral institutions and bilateral agencies could play an important role by building capacity and supporting improvements in these areas.",

First, if infrastructure financing leads to a crowding out of private sector investment its growth impact will be mitigated, putting upward pressure on debt levels. Second, the ability of the government to capture at least part of the marginal product of infrastructure, whether through taxes or user fees, will determine how the investment affects the country's fiscal sustainability outlook. If, for example, the tax administration is weak and fiscal revenues capture only a small fraction of the extra income, even projects with high growth impacts will weaken government finances. The collection of user fees, on the other hand, may pose significant challenges, especially in low-income countries where the population is poor and administrative capacities weak. Third, government finances will also be affected by the cost of borrowing, which depends on the type of financing, the government's level of debt, and the risk perception of the investors. Debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI) substantially reduced debt burden indicators in many low-income countries, enabling them to attract private investors, albeit often at a high cost.

Infrastructure investment would raise the demand for capital goods from capital good-exporting countries, most of which are advanced economies, as well as raise their exports, employment, GDP, and, ultimately, fiscal revenues. It would also contribute to a diversification of the export base of some capital goods-exporting emerging economies, such as China, reducing their dependencies on export demand from a few highincome countries. A global infrastructure initiative could generate a virtuous cycle of global growth. As the income of developing countries is raised, their import demand for products produced around the globe would increase. Boosting exports in advanced economies would not only reduce unemployment and lift their growth, it would also reduce external borrowing needs, potentially unleashing more surplus global savings in support of investment and growth in developing countries. This in turn would lead to additional investment opportunities and potentially open up new markets. Ultimately, this could create a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle",

Second, developing countries will need to raise the funds necessary to close the infrastructure financing gap. As the scope for increasing government spending may be limited in many developing countries and official development assistance (ODA) flows are unlikely to increase in the near future, developing countries will need to look for new innovative financing mechanisms.They could follow the example of recent infrastructure financing initiatives in advanced economics, such as the National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank in the United States and the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, which use existing resources to attract additional private sector financing. Moreover, governments will need to reduce the risk borne by private investors.The international community could play an important role in assisting countries in overcoming these constraints through targeted financial resources and technical assistance.V.1. Implementing the right, bottle-neck releasing infrastructure projects44.Infrastructure projects can be transformational in developing countries. But selecting the right bottleneck-releasing projects requires very specific know-how that is not always available in developing countries. Cross-country empirical evidence confirms that the quality of project selection and implementation plays a crucial role in determining the return on investment and ultimately its growth dividend (see, for example,Esfahani and Ramirez 2003). Furthermore, project appraisal and selection capacities, both of which are key for identifying bottleneckreleasing investments, tend to be particularly low in low-income countries (Dabla-Norris et al.2011).",

In addition, in the context of G20 meetings, the Multilateral Development Banks have developed an Action Plan which proposes concrete actions to improve project preparation, develop regional projects and help countries to improve spending efficiencies (MDB Working Group on Infrastructure 2011). V.2. Closing the financing gap 48. Public infrastructure projects in developing countries can be financed from taxes, bilateral and multilateral lenders and the private sector. Depending on the stage of development, countries rely more on one type of financing versus another. Official development assistance (ODA) which is lending from multilateral institutions and donors on concessional terms is particularly important for investment in low-income countries, financing about 35 percent of new capital spending (see",

Infrastructure aid doubled between 2006 and 2009, as multilateral creditors scaled up their infrastructure financing to dampen the impact of the financial crisis on developing countries (see Figure 5). Multilateral creditors provided infrastructure financing of around US$20 billion in 2006 to 2008, which climbed to US$50 billion in 2009 as the World Bank Group provided record level support of US$26 billion financing for infrastructure. 31 But since the 2008-09 economic crisis affected several donor countries, it is not unreasonable to expect that infrastructure aid is likely to decline in the years to come. Using panel data from 1977 to 2007,Dang, Knack, and Rogers (2009) find that banking crises in donor countries are associated with a significant decline in aid flows by 20 to 25 percent, starting to increase again only about a decade after the start of the crisis. This decline went beyond any income-related effects and was possibly the result of reduced fiscal space and higher debt levels after the crisis.",

During the operation, the investor receives a stream of payments (for example, through user fees or government payments) as a compensation (seem for example, Engel, Fischer and Galetovich 2010).56. Governments in developing countries have been increasingly interested in attracting PrivatePublic Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure investments. One source of information is the World Bank's data base on Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) 35 which provides information on infrastructure investment commitments in which private parties assume operating risks. These commitments reached a record high of US$170 billion in 2010, but have been historically heavily concentrated in a few countries and in one sector, telecommunications.

As infrastructure assets are illiquid, upfront capital financing is large, and repayments often take decades, PPPs entail significant risks for the investor. These risks include higher than projected projects costs; shortfalls in projected revenues, for example, if the demand for the infrastructure services and user-fees is lower than projected; exchange-rate risks if infrastructure financing is provided in foreign currency and if user fees are paid in domestic currency; force majeure; and political and regulatory risks.36   58. Several mechanisms exist that can diversify some of these risks and make investments in developing countries more attractive. Government guarantees can insure against project related risks, such as a shortfall in demand. But they are unlikely to mitigate investors' perception of governmental risk, such as policy reversal, regulatory failure, and concerns of creditworthiness of the government. Multilateral institutions and donors are likely to be better positioned to assume these risks. The World Bank has increasingly made use of guarantees to catalyze private finance by mitigating the risk of default by governments. As 2010, it had approved 36 guarantees, with a cumulative Bank guarantee amount of $3.8 billion in 28 countries (World Bank 2010) since the beginning of the 1990s. MIGA, the arm of the World Bank that provides political risk insurance for foreign investments, recently adapted its products and expanded the potential applications of its guarantees in order to facilitate the underwriting of infrastructure projects.",

The current economic uncertainties have prompted many long-term investors, such as pension funds and life insurers, to de-risk their portfolios and to move toward liquid assets. Infrastructure projects, however, require long-term 10 financing. In addition, private sector involvement tends to be concentrated in specific areas of infrastructure, such as telecommunications, and is more limited in others, such as roads. The government could therefore play a proactive role in attracting more private financing, especially in areas where this type of investment has been limited. The Obama Administration, for example, has backed the creation of a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, 13 which could issue infrastructure bonds, provide subsidies to qualified infrastructure projects, and provide loan guarantees to state or local governments. Loans made by this bank would be matched by private sector investments and each project would generate its own revenues to facilitate repayments.",

A considerable literature 12 considers theoretical conditions under which the Ricardian equivalence may fail, such as if the lifespan of individuals in infinite horizon economies is finite or if idiosyncratic risks exist that cannot be insured. Empirical evidence also does not support the existence of Ricardian equivalence.Solow (2005), for example, argues that it is likely that no more than half of current changes in public saving are cancelled by offsetting changes in private savings.28.Opportunitiesfor bottleneck-releasing infrastructure investments in advanced economies are likely to be limited, however, since their infrastructure capital stock tends to be on average well developed. Moreover, since developing countries are increasingly becoming key drivers of world growth, any infrastructure initiative should include them. In developing countries infrastructure investments can be truly transformative, as was the case in the United States decades ago. In 1919, when the young lieutenant colonel, Dwight D.

The Chinese experience illustrates the benefits of infrastructure investments. Between 1990and 2005, China invested approximately US$600 billion to upgrade its road system.

The gap between the demand and the supply of infrastructure services is large in developing countries, as it is difficult for developing countries to raise significant amounts of long-term financing, which is required for infrastructure investments. Putting a price tag on this gap requires making heroic assumptions as comprehensive and reliable data, which is required to calculate this gap, is unavailable.24  Fay et al (2011) estimate annual infrastructure needs in the range of US$1,250 billion to US$1,500 billion and a financing gap in the range of US$175 -700 billion in developing countries in constant 2008 dollars for 2013 under different scenarios.25  They also estimate that financing for infrastructure projects amounts currently to roughly US$850 billion in developing countries.
