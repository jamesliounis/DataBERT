        "text": "High vaccination rates are widely considered an essential component in managing the pandemic. Initially, a major constraint was a lack of supply of vaccines, especially in low-and middleincome countries (Rouw et al., 2021) . As vaccines started to become more readily available throughout 2021, it became clear that limited demand also posed a significant challenge in some countries, with many people unwilling to be vaccinated for COVID-19 even when provided the opportunity (Africa CDC, 2021; Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) . Many low-and middle-income countries that received COVID-19 vaccines through the global COVAX facility were unable to fully disperse their first batch of vaccines before they expired. In addition to structural barriers and limitations of the health system, a key reason for the lack of use of COVID-19 vaccines was hesitancy among eligible populations (Mwai, 2021) . This raises the question as to what governments could be doing to address people's hesitancy about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in these settings.",

        "text": "In this paper we report on the findings of research studying drivers of vaccine hesitancy as well as research on ways of increasing people's willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Our data comes from a combination of a broadly representative phone survey and an online randomized survey experiment in Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG is an ideal setting to examine this issue as COVID-19 vaccination rates are among the lowest in the world (Howes, 2021) ; existing evidence suggests there are extremely high levels of vaccine hesitancy (Fox, 2021; Pogo et al., 2021) and this issue is viewed by many commentators as the binding constraint on the country's pathway out of the pandemic (Howes, 2021) . The phone survey used in this paper covered over 2,500 households and was conducted in May and early June 2021. The survey included questions about people's willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and the factors that could be contributing to this, such as beliefs about the behavior of others and people's most trusted sources of information about the vaccine. The results were weighted to match the general population based on the most recent nationally representative survey that included a measure of household welfare, which is the 2016-18 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The online randomized survey experiment was conducted in late June and throughout July 2021 with around 2,400 participants and trialed whether messages informed by the findings of the phone surveys could reduce people's hesitancy about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, the treatments that were tested referred to expert advice, social norms and the relative safety of the vaccine.",

        "text": "There is wide-ranging research about the potential drivers of vaccine hesitancy in general and existing work highlights that people's beliefs, along with social norms, often play a crucial role in determining their willingness to get vaccinated (for reviews of existing work see: Brewer et al., 2017; Dub\u00e9 et al., 2015; Larson et al., 2014) . For example, people's beliefs about the effectiveness of a vaccine in preventing illness (compared to the risk of negative side effects) and their own concerns about being infected are expected to influence whether they are willing to get vaccinated. Similarly, prior studies have shown that vaccine hesitancy appears to be related to the behavior of others and people's most trusted information sources, particularly whether people trust misinformation on social media (Africa CDC, 2021; Ahearn, 2021) . In addition, some evidence shows that a relationship exists between previously being vaccinated for another disease (which suggests having trusted a vaccine at some point in the past) and willingness to get a newly developed vaccine (Brewer et al., 2017) . The vaccine hesitancy literature includes mixed effects of determinants such as socioeconomic status and education, which have different relationships to hesitancy depending on country and other contextual factors (Larson et al., 2014.) This underscores the importance of empirical evidence from a range of countries, and especially evidence that can illuminate pathways underlying these relationships.",

Less than one in five adults were planning to get the COVID-19 vaccine and the main reason people provided for not wanting to get vaccinated was concerns about side effects. Trusting the COVID-19 vaccine and believing it has important health benefits were positively correlated with people's willingness to get vaccinated. Similarly, believing others will get vaccinated and encouraging others to get the vaccine were also positively associated with people wanting to get the COVID-19 vaccine. However, there was no clear relationship between other potential explanators of vaccine hesitancy, such as being concerned about COVID-19, people's most trusted source of information about the COVID-19 vaccine, their history of receiving vaccines for other diseases (for example, measles or polio), and their willingness to be vaccinated. This survey also showed that overwhelmingly the most common way people say they would become more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine is by hearing from health experts, particularly in the form of face-to-face communication.",

Only 19.3 percent of respondents in the control group (that is, where no intervention was provided) stated they would be willing to get the vaccine, whereas 30.6 percent of respondents that received the relative safety treatment said they would get vaccinated, representing an over 50 percent increase. The two other intervention arms that were provided (referring to expert advice and social norms) did not have a consistent impact on people's willingness to get vaccinated. The main findings of the online randomized survey experiment did not vary substantially across the demographics of respondents, though female respondents and those in the Southern region were more likely to respond to the social norms treatment. These types of respondents were also less likely to participate in the online experiment relative to the general population. As a result, after population weights were applied (in terms of sex, age and location) the social norms treatment became statistically significant.",

Drawing on the combination of the phone survey and the experiment also affords increased ability to assess the generalizability of our results. Both the phone survey and the experiment present very similar descriptive statistics that show there are high levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in PNG, primarily because of respondents being concerned about side effects from the vaccine, and that people claim health experts are the most likely to be able to change their mind. These patterns hold across the surveys, even though different platforms were used (that is, phone and online) at different points in time, and also hold across most demographic characteristics. As a result, the findings are robust to alternative approaches to weighting (or analyzing the data without survey weights). This suggests that the main findings are likely to hold across the general population in PNG and potentially in other countries facing similar challenges.",

        "text": "There are several implications that flow from our findings for policy makers as they work to address vaccine hesitancy. We provide comprehensive evidence that building greater trust in COVID-19 vaccines is pivotal to ensure that a high share of the population is willing to get vaccinated. In addition, we show that simple messages, of a kind that could be easily disseminated, about the relative safety of COVID-19 vaccines can substantially increase people's stated willingness to be vaccinated. We also show that local health workers have a crucial role in building this trust. In addition, our findings point to existing explanations for vaccine hesitancy that should potentially receive less attention. Most notably, we show it is unlikely that misinformation on social media is the key driver of vaccine hesitancy in PNG. Furthermore, our results illustrate that people's concerns about COVID-19 and their history of vaccination is unrelated to their willingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19. Collectively, these findings suggest communication campaigns should recognize the distinct nature of the hesitancy people have around COVID-19 vaccines and greater efforts should be made to communicate that getting vaccinated is the single best way to prevent severe illness or death from COVID-19.",

Firstly, we are among the first to conduct a detailed examination of people's hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccines using both causal and descriptive evidence in a low-and middle-income country. Existing studies in these settings typically do not go beyond reporting on the level of willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and the main reasons respondents state for their hesitancy about getting vaccinated (Africa CDC, 2021; Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) . We provide new insights by clearly identifying the most plausible drivers of hesitancy regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and testing the elasticity of people's willingness to get vaccinated to different messages. The combination of these descriptive and experimental findings helps shed light on both the issues likely to be reducing demand for COVID-19 vaccines and the degree to which it is possible to increase demand through communication campaigns.",

Prior work on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has tended to involve either observational data from phone surveys (Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021) or online experiments (Palm et al., 2021) in isolation. In contrast, we asked the same questions to the more broadly representative phone survey samples of respondents as were asked to participants in the online randomized survey experiment. By comparing the results of these different survey techniques we were able to better estimate the effects of the treatments on a broader share of the population. Furthermore, the similarities in descriptive results across the distinct approaches illustrate the robustness of our general findings. This paper is structured as follows. In the next section we review the related literature about vaccine hesitancy. This is followed by an overview of the setting and methodology used. We then present the results of the representative phone survey and online randomized survey experiment separately, as well as analysis that draws on both. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings.",

Their paper reports on results from surveys conducted in 13 countries, spanning the Americas, Africa, South Asia, and Europe. All countries except the Russian Federation, Colombia and the United States are low or lower-middle income countries. One clear takeaway from the study is just how much variation there is between countries in willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Also striking is the fact that surveyed willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine is higher -on average over 80 percent -in the low, and lower-middle income countries, than it is in either Russia or the United States (Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021 , p. 1389 . Although results varied between countries, women tended to be somewhat less willing to be vaccinated than men, and younger respondents marginally more willing (Sol\u00eds Arce et al., 2021 , p. 1387 .",

Or, by reinforcing the emerging social norm, the messages may indirectly increase confidence in the vaccine through the signal of the social norm, and at the same time impose a cost of deviating from this norm (H2). 3.1 Background about COVID-19 and vaccination rates in PNG PNG is the second largest fragile state in East Asia and the Pacific (after Myanmar) with a population of almost 10 million people, over a third of which live below the extreme poverty line (World Bank, 2021) . The country is diverse, with over 800 languages spoken, and large pockets of the population are geographically isolated due to mountainous terrain and remote islands (Filer and Wood, 2021) . On average, adults have completed less than five years of schooling, which is one of the reasons that PNG ranks in the bottom 20 percent of countries globally in terms of the United Nations Human Development Index (United Nations Development Programme, 2020). 3 Provision of public services, such as access to basic health care facilities, is poor (Howes et al., 2014) . PNG also has among the lowest vaccination rates in the world for a range of diseases, which contributed to a polio outbreak in the country in 2018 (Howes and Mambon, 2021; Morgan et al., 2020) . In addition, vaccination rates have fallen considerably in recent years (Howes and Mambon, 2021) .",

Most of these cases were reported between the end of February and start of June (see Figure 2 ). The actual case numbers are likely to have been much higher due to low overall testing, underreporting and limited contact tracing capacity (World Health Organization, 2021). PNG's Prime Minister, James Marape, claimed that one in three or four Papua New Guineans may have been infected with COVID-19 in March (McGuirk, 2021) . Although the epidemiological curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases began to flatten throughout July and August, it is unclear the extent to which this is simply due to limited testing (around a third of COVID-19 tests are positive), and it is believed that community transmission remains widespread in much of PNG (World Health Organization, 2021).",

To assist in addressing the rising number of cases, PNG received its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility in April. This consisted of 132,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were licensed and manufactured by Serum Institute of India. Additional doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were provided by the Australian government and in May doses of the Sinopharm vaccine (primarily being made available to Chinese citizens) that were provided by the Chinese government began to be administrated (both vaccines require two doses). It is estimated that tens of thousands of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine provided through COVAX and by the Australian government expired at the end of July and were not used (ABC News, 2021a).

In late May, the general population was able to gain access to the COVID-19 vaccine, primarily in the Southern region where there had been a greater number of cases and more access points were available (particularly in the largest city of Port Moresby). However there are over 100 vaccination sites located across Papua New Guinea, with vaccination sites situated in all of the country's provinces (National Control Centre for COVID-19, 2021). The bulk of vaccination sites are located in hospitals or local health centers. Although vaccination sites are located across the country, Papua New Guinea's geography is such that accessibility is less than ideal.

The phone survey used geographic quotas based on the most recent tower that mobile phones had been connected through to ensure there was coverage across all provinces and districts in PNG. To address concerns that the population with access to mobile phones may be disproportionally wealthier, efforts were made to oversample phone users that do not send text messages and/or rely on others to transfer them credit to pay for their phone use.

The DHS is the most recent nationally representative data set including a measure of welfare and therefore this survey was used as the base for the reweighting. The mobile phone survey weights were designed to follow the distribution of the sample by province and urban/rural location. The weights were calibrated to the DHS distribution. This addressed issues with oversampling related to the number of calls but did not adjust for differences in the distribution of the wealth index or for differences in demographic variables. To adjust for differences in the distribution of the wealth index, the DHS and mobile phone survey data were appended, and a logit model was run with the mobile phone survey equal to one and the DHS equal to zero. The dependent variables were the wealth index, square of the wealth index, and the cube of the wealth index. The inverse of the prediction was then taken and collapsed into deciles, and these deciles were multiplied with the calibrated weights. These weights were then winsorized 4 at the top 0.5 percentile to address any outliers, adjusted to account for households with multiple mobile phones (and therefore higher probabilities of selection), and calibrated again using the region and urban/rural location. This further adjusted the weights for differences in the distributions between the phone survey and the DHS, but only adjusted for differences in the demographics to the extent that they were correlated with wealth. As a final step, the weights were raked to match the mean values from the DHS on the following characteristics: gender of the respondent, age group of the respondent, education of the respondent, household size, province, and urban/rural location. The resulting weights were based on the household level as the DHS is a representative household survey. It is important to recognize that the low rates of phone ownership means that reweighting of responses is unlikely to be able to fully take into account unobserved characteristics of the population without access to a phone.",

As such the focus of the phone survey drawn on in this paper was more on understanding what was driving the high levels of hesitancy as opposed to examining the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in PNG. To achieve this aim, an array of questions were included allowing for a detailed examination of the extent to which different factors influence vaccine hesitancy. These questions were sourced directly from a combination of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy surveys that the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO had undertaken in PNG or in other low-and middle-income countries. The phone survey went to the field as the national rollout of the vaccine was beginning and as a result the vaccine questions were asked assuming respondents could potentially have already received their first dose.",

Both surveys collected samples of respondents that are somewhat representative of the population that has access to their respective communication channels (i.e. the phone survey is somewhat representative of the population with access to a phone and the online experiment is somewhat representative of the population with access to the internet). Efforts were made to oversample poorer respondents in the case of the phone survey (see Section 4.1 for details) and ensure respondents participated across PNG in the online experiment (i.e. survey quotas were applied at the regional level). As such both surveys did not rely solely on random sampling, which means they somewhat, but not perfectly, represent the population that has access to their respective communication channels. To be able to make inferences about a broader population, it was necessary to weight responses to better reflect the demographics of the national population (such as age, sex and location) (see Table 2 ). Reweighting does not mean either survey perfectly reflected the views of all people in PNG as those who have access to the internet and phones may be systematically different. However, to the extent that these differences are correlated with demographic characteristics, survey weights can correct for them. To make comparisons between the insights that the phone survey and online experiment reveal about the general population in PNG it is necessary to apply a common approach to the survey weights. As mentioned in the preceding subsections, the phone survey was designed with the intention of household weights being used based on the 2016-18 DHS, which would allow for representative analysis at the household level about a range of COVID-19 related topics. In contrast, the online experiment, as is standard practice for this type of work, was designed for data analysis to be primarily conducted at the individual level without applying any survey weights (Haaland et al., forthcoming) . However, it is common practice for survey weights to be applied to online experiments to provide an estimate of how generalizable the findings are likely to be.",

In the phone survey we focus on in this paper, around 9 out of 10 respondents were aware of specific actions the government has taken to address COVID-19 in regard to the health and/or education sectors. However, when asked to estimate COVID-19 cases numbers and deaths across PNG or within their province, almost 80 percent of respondents stated they were unsure. The remaining respondents that provided an estimate were remarkably accurate. On average, respondents provided very similar estimates of the perceived number of COVID-19 cases in their province as what was actually the case in terms of reported figures (see Figure 4 ).",

There were no large differences in willingness to get vaccinated between respondents with different demographic characteristics, except that men were slightly more likely to be willing to get vaccinated (see Figures A1-A4 in Appendix A). This finding is consistent with existing work showing that vaccine hesitancy does not tend to be primarily associated with socioeconomic status or education levels (Larson et al, 2014.) . Respondents were asked \"Have you been vaccinated for COVID-19?\" and \"Are you planning to be vaccinated?\" Because the focus of this paper is on vaccine hesitancy, we restrict our analysis to respondents who were aware of the vaccine but were yet to get vaccinated. Among this subset of respondents, a very similar share in the phone survey and control group in the online experiment stated they would get vaccinated (only 18.2 and 18.4 percent). Respondents to the phone survey were much more likely to state that they would not get vaccinated (53.3 percent), whereas participants from the control group in the online experiment were more likely to state they were unsure (55.5 percent). 5.1.4 Reasons for vaccine hesitancy (based on both the phone survey and online experiment)",

The same options were provided in both surveys. However, in the online experiment respondents were asked to select the main reason they were not prepared to get vaccinated, whereas in the phone survey respondents could select all that applied (see Figures 5a and  5b) . Around four-fifths (78%) of respondents selected worried about side effects as a reason for hesitancy in the phone survey and around half (48%) selected this as the main reason in the online experiment. Health experts were by far the most likely group of people to be able to reduce recipients' vaccine hesitancy, according to phone survey respondents and participants in the control group in the online experiment (see Figure 8 ). Respondents that did not plan on being vaccinated or were unsure were asked \"Would you be more likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if any of the following individuals/authorities receive or recommend the vaccine?\" in both surveys based on the same list of groups of people. In the phone survey where respondents could select all that applied, around half (48%) of respondents selected health workers. In the online experiment where respondents selected the main group most likely to change respondents' minds, around two-thirds (66%) of respondents selected health workers. In addition, phone survey respondents were asked their most preferred way of receiving information about the vaccine and around four out of five (80.1%) respondents stated face-to-face communication from health workers (see Figure A5 in Appendix A). Collectively, these results provide evidence that advice from health experts about the COVID-19 vaccine is likely to positively influence people's willingness to get vaccinated. 5.2 Drivers of vaccine hesitancy according to the phone survey (based solely on the phone survey)",

Almost 30 percent (28.9%) of respondents in the control group stated they were unwilling to get vaccinated whereas this figure was less than 20 percent (17.0%) in the relative safety treatment group (26.4% and 23.8% in the expert advice and social norms treatment groups respectively). There was some indication that the social norms group reduced people's unwillingness to get the vaccine however this was only weakly statistically significant. There was no significant effect from the expert advice treatment. Similar results hold after controlling for the background characteristics of respondents (see Table A7 in Appendix A).",

Firstly, it provides comprehensive evidence that boosting people's trust in COVID-19 vaccines appears to be a fundamental step in increasing people's willingness to get vaccinated. The phone survey showed strong correlations between willingness to get vaccinated and trust in the vaccine as well as believing it has important health benefits. The online experiment illustrates that information about the relative safety of COVID-19 vaccines substantially increases willingness to get vaccinated and reduces opposition to receiving the vaccine. Collectively, these results suggest that many people make some form of basic \"cost benefit analysis\" about whether the consequences of COVID-19 justify the risk of being vaccinated. Further evidence that this is the case can be seen by the fact that respondents who believed many people had died from COVID-19 in PNG were much more likely to want to get the vaccine (see Figure A20 in Appendix A). The implication for policy makers from this is that they should prioritize efforts to inform the general population that COVID-19 vaccines can be effective at preventing severe illness, there are very low risks of developing negative side effects and becoming ill with COVID-19 results in a non-trivial chance of death for those who are unvaccinated.",

This is good news. It suggests that at least some of the apprehension about COVID-19 vaccines present in PNG stems simply from the fact that people do not feel they know enough about the new vaccine, as opposed to entrenched \"anti-vaccination\" positions of the sort found in other countries. As a result, it may prove feasible to shift people's views on COVID-19 vaccines in Papua New Guinea.",

The phone survey illustrated that most people who were willing to be vaccinated believed their family and friends would also be vaccinated. People intending to be vaccinated were also likely to recommend vaccination to others. Those who were not willing to be vaccinated did not think their family and friends would either. At present it appears that PNG is in a lowlevel equilibrium whereby few people are willing to get vaccinated, partly because few people are willing to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy and supply are interrelated through this mechanism, which highlights the need to pair communications with other policies that will encourage vaccine take-up, in order to create a virtuous cycle where increasing take-up shifts norms and encourages more take-up. The fact the social norms treatment's effects were primarily to be found in subsets of the survey sample (particularly women) suggests there is scope for developing more effective normative appeals. It is possible that different types of information may be more effective in transmitting a norm-based message, and there is a strong case for further research in this area. However, it may well be that some sectors of the population will ultimately need to see firsthand their family, friends and others in their community receiving the vaccine before norms become truly effective in shaping attitudes. Although this would be a discouraging finding for those who hope to use information interventions to help increase vaccine uptake, it would be a positive finding in another sense: vaccinating those who are already willing to be vaccinated may itself help to change the attitudes of others as they see their fellow community members safely taking the vaccine.",

The phone survey illustrated that around 80 percent of respondents said they would be more willing to get the vaccine if health workers recommended it, which is a much higher share of respondents than those that would listen to the recommendations of others, such as family and friends or religious leaders. Importantly, the phone survey showed that the way people would like to receive this information is face to face, suggesting that communication from local health workers will have the biggest influence on people's take-up of the vaccine. In addition, the online experiment's results, and the failure of Treatment A, which presented the views of \"national and international experts\", strongly suggest that generic advice from experts will not serve as an adequate substitute for specific matter of fact advice received from trusted local health workers. One potential complicating factor facing authorities is that vaccine hesitancy is comparatively high among health workers (Pogo et al., 2021) . This suggests that high priority should be given to educating local health workers about the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine (including the low risk of side effects) so they can become advocates in their community for vaccination.",

In addition, there was no relationship between willingness to get the vaccine and relying on the internet as a trusted source of information about the COVID-19 vaccine.

As such, efforts to simply further raise people's concerns about COVID-19 are unlikely to generate greater demand for the vaccine.

In fact, there was a slightly negative relationship. Similarly, there was no relationship with getting one's children vaccinated and willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Collectively, these findings suggest that hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccine is quite distinct from hesitancy about vaccines in general.

When weighting techniques are applied to adjust for differences between the demographics of respondents and the general population (for example, in terms of age, gender, education levels, and so on, and so forth) the overall conclusions are qualitatively similar. The weighted and raw results about the main outcome of willingness to get vaccinated are similar across the phone survey and online experiment. By drawing on administrative data based on the history of phone use in PNG, we were also better able to sample poorer respondents than would be the case by simply relying on random digit dialing, which is common practice in other low-and middle-income countries (Global Poverty Research Lab, 2020). The close to monopoly status of the main telecommunications company in PNG allowed this approach of oversampling poorer respondents to be more effective than efforts along these lines elsewhere in the world (Himelein and McPherson, 2021) .",

We have shown that, consistent with this model, information can raise trust in vaccines in some instances. The instances may, potentially, be quite specific -PNG is a low-income country, where COVID-19 vaccinations are not yet common.

Given such variation, it may be the case that the sources of vaccine hesitancy, and the best means of overcoming it, may vary from country to country.
