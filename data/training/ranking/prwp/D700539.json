        "text": "The corporate income tax holiday is a tax incentive frequently used by less developed countries (LDCs) to promote capital investment. The usual form of the holiday is to allow a 'pioneer\" firm operating in a designated industry to be fully or partly exeompt from corporate taxation during its formative years with full taxation applying after the holiday period. Of the 54 LDC tax systems described in a Price Waterhouse survey (19861, 27 Much of the current literature on capital formation and effective tax ratesl has concentrated on investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and statutory tax rate abatements as tax incentives (see, for example, King and Fullerton (1984] and Boadway, bruce and Mintz [1984] ). These tax incentives are not particularly difficult to analyze since it can be assumed that the firm anticipates the tax system to be unchanging overtime. With additional assumptions, time invariant effective tax rates are derived that are useful for describing the long run impact of the tax system on capital. For example, the usual assumptions include the following: (i) real capital good prices increase at a constant rate over time, (ii) capital depreciates 1/ The notions of the effective tax rate and the cost of capital are fairly well known now in the literature so they are only briefly defined here. The user cost of capital is depreciation and financing costs, adjusted for taxes, that are incurred by the firm when holding capital. Effective tax rates are conventionally defined as the difference between the marginal gross-of-tax rate of return (the user cost of capital net of depreciation costs) and the net-of-taA rate of return that savers earn when investing in the firm's capital. This difference may be divided by the gross-of-tax or net-of-tax marginal rates of return.",

This implies that the cost of capital is no longer time invariant, making the tax holiday problem more difficult to analyze compared to other tax incentives that have been treated in the literature. The scant literature on this subject has concentrated on issues related to the reasons why tax holidays may be used as an incentive without trying to derive the effective tax rate on capital during a holiday (Bond and Samuelson [1986] and Doyle and van Wijnbergen (1984] ).2 The task of this paper is quite different. The user cost of capital, which varies over timil, is derived for a firm that correctly anticipates the length of the holiday and the tax regime that exists after the holiday.

        "text": "-3-If c\u00b1e firm is fully exempt from corporate income taxation during the holiday, what is its effective tax rate? A first response would be that capital bears no tax at all. This would be correct for short term capital that fully depreciates before the end of the holiday. However, as shown later, the effective tax rate on long term holiday investments depends on the relationship between tax depreciation and true economic depreciation. Even though the firm is tax exempt during the holiday, it must pay taxes on income generated by holiday investments once the holiday is finished. If the firm must write down the value of its assets for tax purposes during the tax holiday, the tax depreciation writeoffs after the tax holiday may be inadequate relative to the true cost of depreciation. For example, suppose capital is written off at a 100% rate of tax purposes but has an economic life that goes well beyond the holiday period. A firm that undertakes an investment during the holiday must expense the capital for tax purposes, yet pay taxes on profits generated by the remaining capital after the holiday period. In fact, the \"rule\" can be described as follows: the effective tax rate on depreciable capital during the holiday is positive [negative] if the tax depreciation rate (plus inflation rate with historical cost valuation of capital) is more [less) than the true economic depreciation rate. 3 Indeed, it is possible, in the case of long term depreciable capital, that the tax holiday may be no holiday at all in that the effective tax rate on investments during the holiday is higher than that on i/ This rule applies when the firm cannot defer its tax depreciation writeoffs. As we review in the next section, some countries allow tax depreciation to be deferred until after the holiday. We show that capital is generally subsidized when income is fully ei.empt from taxation in the holiday period and firms are allowed to defer depreciation deductions.",

In particular, no In our estimates below, we assume that the rate of depreciation of buildings is 5% and machinery 15% on a declining balance basis. 1 9 We then convert straightline physical depreciation rates into declining balance rates using the well known approximation formula o-2/T (T denoting the life of the asset). As for debt-asset ratios of firms, we assume for one set of calculations that the firm finances capital during the holiday 50% by debt and after the holiday 75% by debt. Recent evidence 2 0 suggests that this would be reasonable to assume although it is clear that only country-specific information would be helpful in this regard. 1V For C6te d'Ivoire, we assume that machinery, which generally includes vehicles and office furniture, depreciate at a 30% rate on a declining balance basis.",

The first is the impact of tax holidays on foreign investment which may taxed by both the capital-importing and capital-exporting countries. Although the theory developed in this paper could be easily generalized for this case, an empirical application would require measuring the the cost of funds for a foreign company. The second issue is with respect to imperfections in capital markets. The theory is based on households earning the same net-of-tax rates of return on assets in perfect markets. If investors are constrained in borrowing funds to finance equity investments, the standard capital market equilibrium does not apply. This is a general issue that is relevant to the current effective tax rate literature as applied to LDCs. The third issue is with respect to \"recapture rules that apply to the sale of assets by corporations. The theory in this paper assumes that the sale of an asset by a firm reduces the base used to calculate depreciation writeoffs.",

Since a tax holiday firm is expected to spin off its capital particularly at the end of the holiday, a more carefully worked out theory would include \"balancing charges\".

This is not entirely surprising. What is surprising, however, is that the effective tax rates on capital during the holiday are generally high and positive in value. The implication of this is that there is rather large tax penalty arising from insufficient tax depreciation deductions taken after the holiday for investments made during the holiday. This tax penalty is highest in those countries with high inflation rates (Morocco and Bangladesh) and with tax provisions that require capital to be quickly written off during the holiday (Bangladesh).
