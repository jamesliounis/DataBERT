        "text": "Mobile technologies show great potential to accelerate internet access and usage, especially in developing countries. A better understanding of key drivers and main constraints for mobile internet access is the first prerequisite for governments to design targeted policy solutions. This study exploits a household survey that collects information on information and communications technology access and usage at the household and individual levels in 22 countries in the Global South. The study finds that in addition to infrastructure investment, which has been the main focus of many developing countries, other demand-side factors are of critical importance. Across the developing world, females, the elderly, those who live in rural areas, and those who have a relatively low level of income or education are less likely to adopt mobile internet. Social network effects are found to have a significant positive impact on the usage of mobile internet. Those who have more close friends using an online social network are more likely to adopt mobile internet. Individuals whose five closest friends are using an online social network (such as Facebook or Twitter) are 63.1 percent more likely to adopt it than those without any close friends using such online social network sites/apps. Across regions, although the factors affecting the adoption of mobile internet remain largely the same, the magnitudes of their impacts vary. In Asia, gender differences are negatively associated with mobile internet. In Africa, the impact of education level is more salient than in the other two regions, implying an urgent need to improve digital literacy.",

        "text": "Since its inception in the 1990s, the internet has transformed the ways people interact, businesses conduct commercial transactions, and governments deliver public services. Internet penetration-on both the supply side (infrastructure deployment) and demand side (user adoption)-continues to improve. International internet bandwidth nearly tripled between 2015 and 2019, to 466 terabytes per second. 2 The share of the global population using the internet increased from 8.0 percent in 2001 to 51.4 percent in 2018. 3 However, the penetration of fixed broadband internet is far from satisfactory in low-income countries, where, in 2018, fixed broadband subscriptions averaged 0.74 per 100 people. 4 In this context, mobile technologies show great potential to accelerate internet access and usage. Global mobile cellular subscriptions increased more than 10 times-from 0.74 billion in 2000 to 7.9 billion in 2018. 5 In low-and middle-income countries, mobile cellular subscriptions also reached a relatively high level of 102 per 100 people in 2018. 6 (However, it is worth noting that the unique mobile subscriber penetration rate, as a share of population, was still as low as 45 percent in the Sub-Saharan Africa region in 2018. 7 ) It is estimated that by 2020, 9 in 10 people will be covered by 3G networks that enable internet access from the palms of their hands (World Bank 2018). The increasing rate of mobile phone ownership in combination with expanding 3G network coverage promises to promote access to and usage of mobile internet.",

For instance, Goldfarb and Prince (2008) find that low income, less-educated people spend more time online. Similarly, Penard et al. (2012) and Penard et al (2015) find that education and computer literacy increase internet usage. Gilwald et al.

        "text": "However, with regards to mobile internet, existing studies have a few limitations. First, previous research has mainly focused on understanding the determinants of mobile phone ownership in developing countries. Education, employment status, and type of electricity are found to be important factors (Aker and Mbiti 2010; Bj\u00f6rkegren 2019; Forenbacher et al. 2019; van Biljon and Kotz\u00e9 2007) . Second, studies on mobile internet adoption tend to focus on the supply side, emphasizing technological aspects such as the efficient compression of images or data delivery (Kim and Kim 2002) . Funk (2005) presents how certain technological products such as the push mail service and micropayment systems promote mobile internet adoption. Third, only specific country or regional data are used in the few studies analyzing the demandside factors affecting mobile internet adoption. For instance, Srinuan, Srinuan, and Bohlin (2012) use data from Thailand to find that price, the availability of fixed telephony, and individuals' age and location are strong determinants of mobile internet adoption. Consumers' perspectives on service applications are also found to affect mobile internet adoption in Taiwan, China (Hsu, Lu, and Hsu 2007) . Hasbi and Dubus (2020) provide evidence of the positive impact of being part of an online social community on mobile broadband use in Sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, a cross-country/region analysis that presents commonalities and differences in how specific demand-side factors affect mobile internet adoption across developing countries is missing.",

This is also consistent with the framework proposed by van Dijk (2006) , who argues that there is a cumulative and recursive model of digital technology adoption, starting with motivation, followed by physical/material access, subsequently requiring digital skills and complementary services (such as electricity) to achieve usage, leading to strengthened motivation and increased usage over time. A higher level of skills and more customized products could strengthen the initial motivation.",

At a later stage, other social science disciplines came into play as the research on the digital divide evolved. One strand of the literature argues that psychological attitudes toward ICTs affect their adoption (Srinuan and Bohlin 2011; van Dijk 2006) , while a second strand emphasizes the role of social networks in shaping perceptions and driving adoption, such as membership in occupational, religious, or cultural communities (Al-Jaghoub and Westrup 2009; Andr\u00e9s et al. 2010).",

        "text": "The abovementioned studies focus on assessing the determinants of fixed-internet access and usage, many in developed countries. Nevertheless, the fixed internet and mobile internet are different in a variety of aspects such as the price of access devices, convenience of access, coverage and reliability of signal, connection speed, and so on. This paper will explore whether the three main determining factors behind the adoption of general ICTs apply to mobile internet as well. First, the physical infrastructure needed to access mobile internet at the level of 3G or above differs from the telephone or fixed-line broadband connections needed for fixed internet. Household access to electricity is essential for laptop usage with fixed connections, but people can charge mobile phones at other places outside the home, such as offices, community hotspots, or with neighbors. Second, socioeconomic factors such as income and education level might affect access to and usage of mobile internet differently than they do other types of ICTs. For instance, the cost of a mobile phone device is often less than that of a desktop computer. Many mobile network operators and technology firms (e.g., social media platforms) offer a variety of data promotion packages to attract potential customers, and mobile systems can be more intuitive and easier to learn. Third, in terms of perspective factors, with the recent booming of social media, it is argued that social network effects such as the desire to follow friends or family on social media mobile apps are of particular relevance to the access and usage of mobile internet.",

However, such usage can be captured through combining information gained through multiple survey questions regarding whether respondents: (1) have used the internet or not, (2) own a mobile phone, and (3) whether the type of mobile phone they own allows internet access. An individual is counted as using mobile internet if he or she has used the internet and also owns an internet-enabled phone. 9 Results show that Latin American countries have the highest rate of mobile internet adoption: 65.6 percent of the total population. The rural and urban divide is significant across all regions (figure 1), especially in Africa, where the adoption rate among urban residents is more than twice that among rural residents. Asian countries in the sample have the widest gender gap: only 8.4 percent of females used mobile internet in 2017. Those who are at the bottom 40 percent of the national income distribution have a lower adoption rate across regions, while the gap is minimal in Latin America. The demographic profiles of mobile internet users and nonusers are notably different (figure 2). Across the countries covered in the sample, 54 percent of the nonusers are female, and 68 percent of them are living in rural areas, while the majority of mobile internet users are male and urban residents. The average age of mobile internet users is 29.6 while that of the nonusers is 37.1, indicating that the elderly lag behind in adopting new technologies. Mobile internet users tend to be more educated and wealthier than nonusers. The average number of years of formal education (12.0 years) of mobile internet users is almost twice that of the nonusers (6.1 years). Furthermore, 92 percent of mobile internet users have at least completed primary school, while more than half of the nonusers have either no formal education or have not completed their primary education.

For those who do not have a mobile phone, affordability is a bottleneck across countries: 68.5 percent of those without a mobile phone in Cambodia cite affordability as such. The obstacle of electricity access is particularly severe in Africa (figure 4), especially in Rwanda (50.9 percent) and Senegal (40.4 percent).
