        "text": "Trade prices are a principal channel through which movements in the exchange rate and changes in trade policy affect domestic variables for an open economy. Symmetric passthrough of tariffs and exchange rates to prices could allow the response of import prices to exchange rates to be used to predict the effect of changes in tariffs (Feenstra, 1989) . This can be useful in the analysis of trade policy. The currencies in which transactions in international trade are invoiced reveals one of the key mechanisms that explain heterogeneity in exchange rate and by extension tariff pass-through. An increase in tariffs may lead foreign exporters to that country to lower prices and therefore the tariff is less than fully passed through in prices, and the importing country experiences a terms-of-trade gain. These issues are of particular relevance to developing economies given that most trade takes place in the U.S dollar, they have relatively higher tariffs, and they are subject to relatively larger exchange rate changes.",

In comparison with the literature, the contribution is twofold. First, the paper provides evidence on pass-through rates on exports from high-income to low-income countries, namely from various European Union (EU) countries to Malawi. Second, it does so using very detailed data that allow identifying i) the country of origin and the product being exported (as in most of the related literature), ii) the exchange rate but also the tariff duty affecting the good's price in the destination country (while most of the literature typically focuses on exchange rate pass-through due to a lack of good data on applied tariffs), and iii) the currency of invoicing for the good (which is relatively rare information at that level of disaggregation). Thanks to these rich data, we are able to i) estimate exchange rate and tariff pass-through within an integrated framework at a high level of disaggregation, and ii) estimate pass-through rates for various groups of countries (Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members and non-EMU EU members), various currencies of invoicing (euro and the 1 U.S. dollar) and various sectors. The paper uses a simple pricing equation, under imperfect competition and assume a Calvo price adjustment process.",

        "text": "The results show that although the symmetry hypothesis holds for the bilateral exchange rate, this is no longer consistently the case for products invoiced in various currencies and when the invoicing currency exchange rate is used. In general, the dollar has the highest invoicing share in imports from the EU although there is higher euro invoicing among EMU products. On average, the pass-through of exchange rate and tariff shocks on to Malawian consumers is high. Specifically, using the bilateral exchange rate initially suggests that there is symmetry, but when invoicing currencies are considered, exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) of euro-priced goods is lower compared to dollar invoiced products, and higher than the tariff pass-through (TPT) for imports from the EMU. Therefore, the symmetry hypothesis often made in macroeconomic models no longer holds. This may be that since tariffs are more predictable than exchange rates, firms optimally increase prices in response to changes in tariffs than in response to similar favorable movements in exchange rates, thus making prices more responsive to tariffs.",

When either the euro or the dollar exchange rates are used, again tariffs take up the most explanatory power in the changes in import prices of EMU products, but there is clarity on which exchange rate matters. The symmetry assumption holds with the euro exchange rate in EMU products but tariffs affect import prices more than the dollar exchange rates. However, symmetry holds with either the euro or the dollar exchange rates in imports from non-EMU countries as both are vehicle currencies to non-EMU states. Thus, in order to predict the effects of trade policy based on import prices' responses to exchange rates, bilateral exchange rates are not suitable for capturing exchange rate pass-through and pass-through of \"non-dominant\" currencies is still high, for small developing countries such as Malawi.",

We use similar assumptions on imperfect competition, but go further by considering the currency of invoicing, motivated by recent literature that shows that when a vehicle currency such as the U.S dollar is used, there is greater exchange rate pass-through to import prices of that exchange rate compared to the bilateral exchange rate . Another study in this literature is Menon (1996) for Australian manufacturing, focusing on exchange rate pass-through and non-tariff barriers. The non-tariff barriers were found to explain the variation in pass-through. These symmetry studies however remain surprisingly limited and have mainly been for advanced economies. Among the few developing country studies is Mallick and Marques (2008) for India, who find that on average exchange rate pass-through is a dominant effect compared to tariff rate pass-through in explaining changes in India's import prices. Similarly, Benassy-Quere et al. (2018) found diversions from the symmetry assumption while Bouveta et al. (2017) similarly found diversions to symmetry in the context of global value chains (GVCs). Our diversions stem from the invoicing of products, which has not yet been considered in these analyses and is relevant given the now-known importance of currency invoicing in ERPT.",

On invoice currencies and exchange rate pass-through, empirical literature concludes that pass-through varies among products invoiced in different currencies and market structure. 2 Small open economy studies include Boz et al. (2017) and who study imports of Turkey and Colombia respectively. They conclude that the dollar exchange rate quantitatively dominates the bilateral exchange rate in pass-through to prices in the former and the dominant currency pass-through is high in the latter. Subsequent studies on exchange rate pass through have dealt with the invoice currency choice in relation to the exchange rate using transaction level data (Devereux et al. (2017a) ; ), the invoice currency choice and its determinants (Ligtharty and Werner (2012) ; Gopinath (2016)) or the tariff pass-through behavior separately (Hayakawa and Ito (2015) ). However, the paper further demonstrates that even when the dollar has the highest share, other vehicle currency ERPT matters as much as the \"dominant\" currency, hence the focus on the euro.",

        "text": "Studies on EU trade and euro usage in trade have mainly been done with a sample of advanced economies and/or trade partners. One key factor is due to the lack of data that details invoicing currencies used for both advanced and developing economies. L. S. Goldberg and Tille (2005) found that non-euro area countries have higher U.S. dollar invoicing while euro area countries are more likely to invoice in the euro. L. S. Goldberg (2008) found that the euro is mainly used by countries with geographic proximity to the euro area, but not extensively used elsewhere. Kamps (2006) empirically showed that a country's membership or prospective membership of the EU increases the probability of choosing the euro as an invoicing currency. Ligtharty and Werner (2012) found that the euro tends to be chosen more frequently and has overtaken the U.S. dollar as a role of vehicle currency in Norwegian imports. This demonstrates that the euro is likely to continue to become important in international trade and would have implications, perhaps similar to, the dollar in explaining exchange rate pass-through. This paper brings these aspects in the literature together extending these studies to analyze the use of the euro in producer currency pricing and as a vehicle currency by EMU and non-EU European exporters in trading with a developing country and implications for ERPT and TPT. The paper also uses unpublished and novel data of Malawian imports from the European Union (EU), spanning between January 2007 to December 2018 at the 8-digit level of the Harmonized System (HS). Although importers are not identified, the data allows for careful construction of unit values measured at the level of a transaction, extending beyond the traditional use of aggregate level data.",

K. Goldberg and Knetter (1997) , incomplete pass-through implies that the difference between the estimated coefficient and full pass-through is offset by changes in the markup when a cost measure is included as a control variable. Based on the findings of Hayakawa and Ito (2015) and the theoretical model of Feenstra (1989) , incomplete pass-through means that an increase in T or ER induces the firm to decrease \u03c0 to reduce the impact of the shock on consumers prices. This is optimal if the price elasticity of demand is increasing so that the exporter is willing to reduce its mark-up when exchange rates or tariffs inflate consumer prices (Knetter, 1989) .

To test these hypotheses, we introduce dummy variables for whether a specific product is priced in the euro or the dollar, and include a full set of interaction terms with the exchange rate similar to Devereux et al.

Figure 6 plots the changes in the log of price and tariff for products invoiced in various currencies.

The cumulative tariff passthrough (TPT) from an increase in import duty on an HS-8 product from an EU country is on average 93 percent. The cumulative exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) from a depreciation in the bilateral exchange rate between MWK and the exporting EU country is on average 90 percent. The difference between these two pass-through coefficients however is not statistically significant from zero, thus \u03b1 is equal to \u03b2 for the EU wide results. Notably, the coefficient for the tariff pass-through is around 14 percent higher for EMU and lower for non-EMU countries, and this difference is statistically significant. On the contrary, exchange rate pass-through rates are not statistically different between EMU and non-EMU countries. We expect the difference to matter for the invoice currency of products more than EMU membership of exporting country. The close to complete pass-through is comparable to results of Colombia, which is another developing country study on invoice currency and exchange rate pass-through by . Table A2 presents the product level regression results. The results are generally in line with theory, with some heterogeneity across sectors and whether products are from the EMU or non-EMU EU country. When analyzing for the EU as a whole, tariff pass-through coefficients are generally not statistically different from exchange rate pass-through coefficients. There are three main exceptions: for wood and raw hides leather articles, tariff pass-through coefficients are lower than exchange rates. This result is driven solely by non-EMU countries, where the exchange rate pass-through to import prices is around 166 percent while the tariff pass-through is around half of that (Table A2) . The relatively higher ERPT compared to other sectors is contrary with findings by sector for Casas (2019) for Colombia, who finds that manufacturers of apparel, leather, and wood products use the fewest imported inputs and therefore have the lowest ERPT into prices.",

This is the case although more than half of imports from the EMU are in the dollar, a diversion from the findings of who find that the dollar exchange rate knocks out the effect of the bilateral exchange rate for Colombia and becomes the \"dominant\" effect. The tariff pass-through is roughly the same and still very high. Consequently, the symmetry hypothesis between the dollar exchange rate and the TPT rate does not hold. Notably, the symmetry hypothesis still holds with the bilateral exchange rate, even when the dollar exchange rate is included in the regression.

Consequently, the dollar exchange rate effect is identical to the effect of tariffs for imports from non-EMU states.

Thanks to these rich data, we are able to i) estimate exchange rate and tariff pass-through within an integrated framework at a high level of disaggregation, and ii) estimate pass-through rates for various groups of countries (Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members and non-EMU EU members), various currencies of invoicing (euro and the U.S dollar) and various sectors.",

There is a difference however in exchange rate pass-through of euro invoiced import prices from the EMU, being nearly 20 percentage points lower than dollar invoiced products. Consequently, the symmetry hypothesis no longer holds for EMU products invoiced in the euro and tariff pass-through coefficients are much higher than ERPT coefficients (over 40 percent). When either the euro or the dollar exchange rates are used, again tariffs take up the most explanatory power in the changes in import prices of EMU products exported to Malawi, but there is clarity on which exchange rate matters.",

Pass-through substantially increases when the analysis accounts for invoicing currencies, allowing us to assess what matters more for import prices. Thus, in order to predict the effects of trade policy based on import prices' responses to exchange rates, bilateral exchange rates are not suitable for capturing exchange rate pass-through. It is also insufficient to account for simply the share of invoicing in imports, as the differences between producer and vehicle currency pricing also persist for prices, and pass-through of \"\"non-dominant\" currencies is still high, for small developing countries such as Malawi.
