        "text": "In recent decades, foreign direct investment (FDI) flows as a share of GDP have more than doubled in both developed and developing nations. While developed countries still account for over 70 percent of the world's outward FDI flows, developing countries including China have become an increasingly important source of FDI as shown in What is the role of geographic connectivity in the rapid growth of FDI? In Figure 2 , we take a look at the spatial distribution of FDI flows in 2001 and 2012, respectively, using data from the UNCTAD FDI Statistics. When comparing the distribution in 2001 with the distribution in 2012, we observe a rightward shift along the distance axis; for example, the share of FDI concentrated at less than 2,500 km has fallen from around 40 percent to less than 30 percent. This change suggests an expansion of FDI flow across space in an era when transportation costs have sharply declined. Reductions in transportation costs could influence FDI through a variety of different mechanisms and the effect evolves with the integration and sourcing strategies of multinational firms. First, the nature of the effect depends critically on the specific motives to invest abroad. While high transportation costs may motivate firms to replicate production across countries (an activity referred to as horizontal FDI), reduction in transportation costs will allow firms to better exploit crosscountry cost differences and engage in vertical or complex FDI strategies where multinational firms separate their production stages across countries and engage in extensive intra-firm trade. In the latter case, FDI and trade become positively interdependent and FDI growth can boost both export and import growth. Second, as FDI involves not only the flow of goods and inputs but also the flow of information, there is an important interplay between investment flows and the flows of ideas and knowhow. Finally, reduced regional transportation costs to transmit goods, intermediate inputs, and services could foster growth of regional value chains. The above effects could, however, vary significantly across countries depending on countries' business environment and absorptive capacity.",

Brainard (1997) , one of the first empirical studies examining the proximity-concentration trade-off, finds that the patterns in which country characteristics relate to U.S. FDI are broadly in alignment with the market access motive. Specifically, she uses U.S. trade and affiliate sales data from the 1989 BEA Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad and finds that FDI increases with hostcountry income and trade cost including the transportation cost to ship goods between the headquarters country and the host country, consistent with the market access motive in horizontal FDI.",

        "text": "Similar findings are shown in Carr, Markusen, and Maskus (2001) who incorporate both horizontal and vertical FDI into a knowledge-capital model of multinational firms and offer support to both market access and knowledge capital hypotheses. In particular, the elasticity of affiliate sales with respect to distance is estimated to range from -0.8 to -1.8, suggesting strong gravity in FDI patterns. Affiliate sales tend to diminish by around 8 to 18 percent when the distance between parent and host countries rises by 10 percent. In fact, the extent of gravity in FDI is comparable to the extent of gravity in trade that has been found in the literature (see, for example, Head and Mayer, 2013) . Yeaple (2003a) extends earlier work by exploring an interaction between country and industry determinants of FDI and offers empirical support to both market access and comparative advantage motives. Specifically, he uses U.S. affiliate sales data in 39 countries and 50 manufacturing industries from the BEA Benchmark Survey of 1994 and finds that U.S. multinational firms from unskilledlabor intensive industries tend to invest in unskilled-labor abundant countries, a result consistent with the hypothesis that countries' factor endowment differences lead to vertical FDI. Unlike in Brainard (1997) , the role of transportation cost is found to be negative and statistically insignificant, departing from the expected sign in the context of horizontal FDI. Irarrazabal, Moxnes and Opromolla (2013) exploit the source of gravity in FDI by introducing intrafirm trade into the framework of Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) and generating gravity relationships for both exports and multinational production. The model rationalizes gravity in FDI by assuming that the headquarters produce a firm-specific tangible or intangible input that is required for production in any location and trade in such input is subject to trade costs including transportation costs or tariffs in the case of physical inputs and cultural and geographic remoteness from the headquarters in the case of headquarters services. The results suggest that intra-firm trade appears to play a crucial role in shaping the geography of multinational production; to justify the gravity observed, the affiliate's cost share related to input purchases from the headquarters must be about 90 percent. As suggested in the paper, this result may have captured other mechanisms that are dampening firms' multinational production as trade costs increase, such as imperfect transmission of technology between parents and affiliates either because of imperfect codifiability as discussed in Keller and Yeaple (2013) or because of higher frictions in the match between firms and workers. knowledge-capital model that incorporates spatial correlations in the independent variables and find that third-country characteristics exert significant effects on FDI flows. The linkage between host countries declines with bilateral distance among the host countries. Using sectoral FDI data, Blonigen et al. (2007) examine how investments in third countries affect a country's receipt of U.S. FDI. They find evidence of negative interdependence across proximate host countries, a result consistent with export-platform FDI theory, among European OECD members. The importance of third-country effects in inbound FDI is shown in Blonigen et al. (2008) . The authors find a strong parent market proximity effect whereby parent markets' proximity to large third nations increases the volume of FDI. Similarly, Chen (2011) examines the cross-country interdependence in French multinationals' production networks using subsidiary-level data and finds strong spatial interdependence in multinationals' foreign production networks. The role of distance and transportation cost depends on the input-output linkages between subsidiary locations. MNCs are more likely to locate final-good production in countries with large market potential, vertically linked subsidiaries in proximate countries, and horizontally linked subsidiaries in remote locations. 4",

Earle, Telegdy and Antal (2013) use linked employer-employee data in Hungary and find the wage premium of foreign acquisition to be around 4.5 percent. The wage premium is observed for all education, experience, gender, and occupation groups as well as across wage quantiles. Divestment to domestic owners, on the other hand, is shown to reverse the effects. On employment, Lipsey et al (2013) find that the shift from domestic to foreign ownership tends to raise employment growth in Indonesia. As for productivity, Arnold and Javorcik (2009) use Indonesian plant level data and find that plant productivity increases about 13.5 percent by the third year under foreign ownership. These productivity improvements occur simultaneously with increases in investment in machinery and equipment, employment, wages and output.

In addition to the direct benefits from foreign acquisition on targeted firms, many studies examine the spillover effect of FDI on other domestic firms in the host country. The literature distinguishes three types of spillover: intraindustry or horizontal spillover, inter-industry spillover through backward linkage, and interindustry spillover through forward linkage. The literature provides little evidence in support of intra-industry productivity spillovers from FDI. Javorcik (2004) and many subsequent studies show that FDI exerts little or negative effects on the productivity of domestic firms in the same industry. Lu et al. (2017) , for example, explore the relaxation of FDI regulations upon China's WTO accession to evaluate the spillover effect of horizontal FDI and find FDI to exert either a negative or an insignificant effect on the productivity of Chinese domestic firms.",

        "text": "\uf0b7 Mediating factors. The existence and the magnitude of productivity spillover could be conditional on a variety of factors such as the absorptive capacity of countries and firms, forms of FDI, and domestic policies. For example, countries and firms with a stronger absorptive capacity such as R&D capacity and relatively skilled labor would be more likely to experience productivity spillovers. For example, Blalock and Gertler (2009) find that Indonesian firms with more R&D, more educated workers, and smaller technology gaps from foreign firms tend to benefit more from FDI. Another study by Javorcik and Spatareanu (2008) finds that ownership structure can also be a mediating factor. They find that vertical spillovers tend to arise from projects with shared domestic and foreign ownership but not from fully foreign owned plants. Du et al. (2012) examine how industrial policy -specifically tariff liberalization and tax subsidies -affects the magnitude and direction of FDI spillovers in China's manufacturing sector from 1998 through 2007. The study finds that liberalization measures during the critical 1998-2007 period on balance served to enhance productivity growth in Chinese industry. A study by Farole and Winkler (2014) , using World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, shows three types of mediating factors: firms' absorptive capacity, investors' spillover potential measured by the share of FDI output sold domestically, and host-country institutional factors. Finally, Espitia et al. (2017) show that distance, the level of development of the host country, and institutions are important mediating factors using panel data for 62 countries from 2005 to 2012.",

However, BRI accounts for a much larger share in China's construction contracts overseas than in China's FDI. Also, unlike FDI, the vast majority of China's construction contracts occur in developing countries. In 2016, the share of BRI exceeded the share of non-BRI countries in China's construction projects. In Figure 8 , we plot the spatial distributions of China's outward FDI and construction contracts, respectively.

To see how BRI countries compare with these regions, we report the average driving distance for BRI and non-BRI in Table 3 and Figure 11 . We find that North America has the highest driving speed, around 103 km per hour, followed by the Middle East & North Africa (89 km per hour) and Europe & Central Asia (88 km per hour). South Asia has the lowest driving speed among all the regions with an average of 41 km per hour. BRI countries fall behind North America, MENA and ECA regions with an average of 85 km per hour. 12 We also construct measures of transportation infrastructure using data from the World Development Indicators (WDI). For railway and airway, WDI reports information on each country's goods transported (million tons per km) and passengers carried (million per km) in a given year. We normalize both of these measures by population and rescale them from 1 (inadequate capacity) to 100 (adequate capacity) across UNCTAD sample countries and sample years to form two indicators. We then take the average of the two sub-indicators as a railway index to proxy for the railway infrastructure quality. While horizontal FDI relies mostly on destination's infrastructure, vertical FDI would rely on both host and source countries' transportation infrastructure. Therefore, for each source-host pair, we construct a pair-year specific \"railway index (OxD)\" as the product of the logged host railway index and the logged source railway index. 13 Airway index is constructed using a similar approach. We construct the sub-indices based on the goods transported and the passengers carried normalized by the country population. The average of the two indices is then constructed as the airway index. The pair-year specific \"airway index (OxD)\" is the product of the logged host airway index and logged source airway index. We also measure port quality using WDI's port quality index.",

Using the constructed railway index and airway index and WDI's the quality of port index, we report country averages by region and by BRI for year 2012 in Table 4 . As shown, there is a clear and positive correlation between income level and infrastructure quality. Not surprisingly, all infrastructure indicators tend to be higher for higher-income countries. Comparing BRI countries with the other country groups, we notice that while the average infrastructure quality of BRI countries is below that of high income countries and BRI's railway index falls slightly below that of upper middle income countries, its airway index and quality of port index are above upper middle income countries. We also report the averages of the three indexes across WBG regions in Table 5 and find that BRI countries are behind North America, East Asia & Pacific and Europe & Central Asia regions but fare better than Latin America & Caribbean, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Zooming into BRI, we also observe a consistent pattern within BRI countries that higher income countries also tend to score higher on the transportation index. The exception is for the railway index, where we found upper middle incomes BRI has higher score than high income groups. This is because Russia has one of the longest railway systems, and one of the highest freight volumes hauled in the world. When we exclude Russia from the calculation, the average of railway index for the upper middle income group drops to 11.46, a level that is close to BRI's overall average. In addition, we found that BRI's high income countries score lower than the world's high income countries in all three types of infrastructure. We report each BRI country's infrastructure proxies score in the appendix. In the next table, we calculate the averages for the 6 corridors in BRI, while these 6 corridors do not cover every BRI country, they cover countries whose geographic locations have strategic importance. These 6 corridors are: Overall, we see intra-BRI variation across corridors. The China, Mongolia, and Russia Corridor scores the highest in terms of railway infrastructure index, while the China, Indochina Peninsula Economics Corridor scores the highest in terms of port quality and airway.

In addition to FDI policy, we also examine BRI countries' participation in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and international investment agreements (IIAs). We obtain the PTA data from the WTO RTA database and the World Bank PTA data, which provide contents and enforcement dates of PTAs across countries. We examine not only the volume of PTAs but also the depth of the agreements. Specifically, following Rocha et al (2017), we define the depth of a PTA as the number of provisions that can be legally enforceable. Trade agreements are classified as either deep or shallow agreements, with shallow agreements concerning only the removal of border barriers to trade and deep agreements involving policies and institutions that facilitate trade. Figure 14 plots the number of PTAs (on the left panel) and the average depth of PTAs (on the right panel) in BRI vs non BRI countries. It is clear that while the two groups account for a similar number of PTAs, BRI countries' PTAs are significantly shallower. Zooming in on BRI countries, the rapid increases in number of PTAs in BRI since 1994 are mainly driven by the increase in BRI countries that are in the ECA region. Figure 15 shows that for ECA the number of PTAs increased from 7 in 1992 to 110 in 2015. As the main receiver of BRI FDI inflow and the main driver of FDI outflow, BRI countries in EAP did not increase the number of PTAs until 2002. The rapid increase in PTA depth in 2002 coincides with the rapid increase in FDI inflow and outflow as shown in Figure 4 . While EAP does not have fewer PTAs, its PTA depth is however deeper than that of the ECA region since 2002. ",

Most of the factors that have been considered in the literature exert significant and expected effects. As in earlier studies, transportation costs between source and host countries are found in general to reduce FDI, but the effect varies significantly by the mode of transportation. A 1-percent increase in air distance is associated with 0.7-1 percent decrease in the volume of FDI. Land transportation cost, measured by either driving distance or driving time, is also found to exert a significant and negative effect: a 1-percent increase in driving time, for instance, leads to a close to 1-percent decrease in FDI.

        "text": "Next, we explore how the effects of distances have evolved over time given the technological improvements in transportation. To do so, we interact the three transportation measures with a vector of dummies that divide the time series into six 5-year windows and allow the distance elasticity of FDI to vary over time. The results are reported in Table 12 and Figure 17 . We find that while the sea distance elasticity of FDI has remained stable in the last three decades, there has been a significant rise in the elasticities of FDI with respect to air distance and driving time, with the estimates nearly doubled. This result, in alignment with Feyrer (2009) which shows similar findings for trade, can be explained by the endogenous selection of goods into the different transportation mode and the increasing usage of air and railway transportation with the technological improvement in air and rail transportation and the proliferation of GVCs. Exporters tend to choose air and rail for goods that are more time sensitive and sea for goods that are less time sensitive. Hence, when there is a change in travel time, goods will respond more to travel time in air and railway than in sea. Over time, with falling air and rail transportation costs and an increasing prevalence of GVCs and intermediate trade, more exports are carried out by air and rail than sea, leading to a growing importance of air and land transportation cost in FDI growth. Next, we examine how the determinants of FDI, in particular, the effects of transportation cost and infrastructure, vary across country groups and regions. First, we compare BRI countries with developed and developing countries, respectively. We find in Table 13 that compared to developed countries, FDI inflows to BRI countries tend to be more sensitive to air transportation as well as land transportation costs. The air distance elasticity of FDI is -1.1 and -0.6 for BRI and developed countries, respectively. The driving time elasticity of FDI is -1.2 for BRI countries, in comparison to -1.1 among developed countries. However, the BRI countries' elasticities are slightly smaller than the average elasticities of developing and least developed countries, which are estimated to be -1.2 and -1.3 for air distance and driving time, respectively. Another notable difference is the effect of PTA depth. The level of PTA depth does not exhibit a significant relation with FDI flows for BRI host countries while a positive and significant relation is found for developed countries as well as the pooled sample of developed and least developed countries.",

Figure 19 plots the ratio of missing FDI relative to actual FDI by country groups. We find the ratio to be the highest (around 4.6) for low-income countries and substantially lower for the rest of the country groups and lowest for the upper-middle income group. Within BRI, we notice that the ratio of missing FDI relative to actual FDI is around 0.7 on average, suggesting a significant potential for attracting additional foreign investment.

This challenge is particularly difficult to overcome in cross-country analysis for two reasons. First, most country economic characteristics are directly associated with both FDI and economic growth and thus cannot serve as instruments for FDI. Second, some of the instruments that have been considered in recent literature such as Alfaro and Chen (2018) explore supply-side variations across multinational firms and require detailed firm-level operation and investment data that are usually unavailable across a wide range of countries.",

(2014) when evaluating the employment effects of imports and instrument FDI inflow to a host country with average FDI inflow to countries that have similar income levels and are located in the same geographic region as the host country. The motivation is to explore variations on the supply of investment which would influence FDI flows to similar countries but are less likely to be associated with economic growth in a particular country via other, non-FDI related channels. We then evaluate how the instrumented FDI inflows affect host-country economic growth and how the effects might vary across countries. Tables 21 and 22 present the OLS and the IV results, respectively. 20 We find that in both the OLS and IV specifications, FDI inflow tends to exert a positive and significant effect on GDP growth but the effects on TFP and patent growth are statistically insignificant. A 10-percent increase in FDI inflow is associated with a 0.17 percentage-point increase in GDP growth rate, 1.2 percent increase in exports and 1.1 percent increase in imports. The effects of FDI on TFP, patent, and employment growth are found insignificant. The latter results are consistent with the existing literature which shows the effects of FDI on productivity and employment to be largely ambiguous due to the opposing ways through which FDI could influence these outcomes.",

Next, we explore the heterogeneity and the possible mediating factors in the economic growth effects of FDI. Figure 21 plots the estimated effects of FDI on GDP, trade and employment growth by country income groups. In general, the effects of FDI are found to diminish with country income level and the strongest for low-income countries. For example, a 10-percent increase in FDI inflow is found to be associated with 0.45 percentage-point increase in GDP in low-income countries, 0.2 percentage-point increase of GDP in lower-middle-income countries, and 0.08 percentage-point increase of GDP in upper-middle-income countries. The GDP effect in high-income countries is found close to 0 and statistically insignificant. This could be due to the ambiguous effect of M&As, the main type of FDI in high-income countries, on GDP and employment growth. The effect of FDI on import is more pronounced and as the GDP effect diminishes with income level. A 10percent increase in FDI inflow is shown to raise imports by 1.78 percent, 1.3 percent, 0.7 percent, and 0.3 percent in low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income countries, respectively. Similarly, FDI exerts a strong effect on exports, especially for lower-income countries.",

The stronger effects on lower-income countries are also consistent with the expectation that vertical FDI and subsequently intra-firm trade are more likely to occur between high-and low-income countries because of their complementarity in task comparative advantage. While the employment effect of FDI is generally insignificant, we find the effect to follow a similar pattern with a greater positive effect on lower-income countries. Figure 21 : The Heterogeneous effects of FDI on economic growth by country income groups When examining the heterogeneous effect of FDI across geographic regions, we find in Figure 22 the effect to be the strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by South Asia and East Asia and Pacific. The estimated GDP growth effect for the BRI countries is similar to the estimated effect for Latin America and Caribbean countries. To assess the effect of BRI on economic growth through the channel of foreign investment, we combine the estimation results from the two stages. If BRI reduces driving time between host and source countries by 10 percent, FDI flows into BRI countries are estimated to increase by 12 percent and the 12-percent increase in FDI inflow is estimated to raise GDP growth rate by 0.2 percentage point for BRI countries as a whole.

We first document and compare the historical patterns of FDI around the world including BRI and non-BRI countries and investigate how different types of transportation cost and infrastructure have affected FDI. Based on the findings, we then assess the potential roles of BRI in fostering FDI growth by improving different types of connectivity and infrastructure. Finally, we evaluate the effects of FDI on economic growth and how BRI might affect economic growth through the foreign investment channel. Finding 1: Reductions in transportation costs raise FDI, but the magnitude of the effect varies by the mode of transportation, with the effects of air and land transportation costs exceeding the effect of sea transportation. Over time, while the sea distance elasticity of FDI has remained stable in the last three decades, the elasticities of FDI with respect to air distance and driving time nearly doubled. Finding 3: Across transportation modes, a reduction of driving time is found to have a strong positive effect on FDI in Middle East and North Africa followed by Europe and Central Asia. A longer railway is found to have a significant positive effect in South Asia and Middle East and North Africa. A better airway index significantly attracts more FDI in East Asia and Pacific and Europe and Central Asia. The positive FDI effect of reduced transportation cost can also be magnified when accompanied by an improvement in business regulatory environment.",

First, initiatives improving physical infrastructure such as BRI can stimulate FDI growth and subsequently GDP and trade growth, but the effects of FDI on aggregate productivity and innovation are insignificant. Second, the impacts vary significantly with host-and source-country development level, across types of infrastructure, and over time. Investment allocation should take into account the great heterogeneity in the expected returns across different projects and geographic areas. Third, the positive effects of infrastructure investment can be magnified when accompanied with an improvement in business environment, specifically an improvement in the ease of business entry. Fourth, there exists a significant amount of missing FDI, i.e., unrealized FDI potential, across countries. Market size and unobserved institutional factors play a central role in explaining missing FDI, especially for developing countries.
