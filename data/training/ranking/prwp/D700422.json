In response to urban sector constraints, the Government has initiated the formulation of an urban policy directed at: (i) strengthening the financial management, autonomy, and viability of the urban local authorities; (ii) devolving responsibility and accountability to urban local authorities for supply, operation, and maintenance of infrastructure services; (iii) determnining establishment structures for the urban local authorities that enhance efficiency; (iv) creating effective cost recovery capabilities; and (v) involving the private sector and community groups in the provision of urban services. Key policy issues addressed in the LSP are : (i) intergovernmental roles; (ii) capacity building; (iii) local government finance; (iv) land management and human settlement development issues; and (v) role of the private sector and community participation. Agreement was reached during negotiations that by the time of the Mid-Term Review (para. 3.26) the Government would, as stipulated in the LSP, present draft legislation to the National Assembly, amending, if necessary, (i) the Local Government Service Act No. 10 of 1982, and (ii) the Local Government Act No. 23 of 1991, to strengthen the financial management, autonomy, and viability of urban local authorities. 1.29 The Government's National Civil Service Reform program has also assisted the urban local authorities with the retrenchment of thousands of staff through compensation packages and personnel planning. New establishments have been set for each of the authorities, and the national civil service salary scales have been revised upwards, approximately doubling the wage compensation of most service grades since July 1994.

The decline of international primary commodity prices (mainly for coffee and sisal) in the 1970s and 1980s and other disincentives to national farmers helped push rural producers to the towns in search of employment. Similarly, the potential income streams, education and other subsidized or free public goods and services led many rural dwellers to Tanzania's largest city, Dar es Salaam, and secondary cities. Dar es Salaam, with approximately 3 million inhabitants, is seven times the size of the next largest city, Mwanza, and continues to attract the majority of migrants. It appears that the incomes in the three largest towns of Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Arusha has grown at rates higher than the national average (3%) since 1975, though this would not have kept pace with population growth in these towns.

In 1972 infrastructure and service delivery responsibilities in Tanzania were centralized and deconcentrated through a regionalization program which disbanded existing local governments. A comprehensive regional tier of government usurped the powers of the urban local authorities, a system which the Government inherited at independence. This resulted in a decade of little or no investment in the management capacity of urban local authorities. Their ability to generate, rationally expend, and account for revenue and provide services was eroded. In 1982 Government passed the Local Government Urban Councils Act and related legislation, effectively restoring the institutions of local government.

For the districts, water supplies are under the District Water Engineer who is technically answerable to his respective Regional Water Engineer. Most regional and district towns receive budget allocations from the Central Government for the O&M of water supplies, which are always far below requirements. Revenue accrued from the sale of water has been directly deposited in the Treasury and has not been available for O&M or direct investments in that region. Management problems range from increasing operating costs (especially electricity and chemicals); poor billing and revenue collection; low tariffs, inadequate funding of O&M; deteriorating and outdated plant and equipment; poor infrastructure and working facilities; and unplanned rapid urbanization and industrialization.",

The decision was based on the recommendations contained in a 1993 study by MOW on Financing of Operation and Maintenance of Urban Water Supply in Tanzania. Their semi-autonomy is based on: (i) Treasury authorization to establish \"special accounts\" for each UWSD as provided for in the Exchequer and Audit Ordinance Act of 1961, which allows for the establishment of a special fund in each town from which moneys may be expended for the purposes for which the fund is established; (ii) establishment of UWSDs; and (iii) establishment of Urban Water and Sewerage Boards (UWSBs) responsible for deciding on key management issues, including tariff levels (also contained in the Act). In order to ensure adequate participation of stakeholders in the management of the water supplies, the UWSBs are composed of representatives of consumers, local and national government, and the private sector. Key MOW staff are appointed to the Board to ensure coordination on technical matters and oversight over government subsidies in the transition period to full autonomy of the UWSDs. The UWSBs periodically evaluate the level of tariffs and revise them as necessary so that all O&M costs, and eventually also amortization, can be financed from the revenues generated (para. 4.1 1).",

Another reform measure that has been initiated is the merger between water supply and sewerage services under UWSDs to facilitate joint billing of water and sewerage and better joint operation and maintenance of the systems. MOW has prepared a draft Cabinet Paper recommending the transfer of sewerage management from the municipal councils to UWSDs. A review of the relevant legislation and municipal by-laws has been carried out, agreements reached with the municipal councils about the changes, and a Cabinet decision is expected soon.

The overriding principle that has guided the preparation of the project is that investments in infrastructure should be made only when the users and municipalities can afford to pay for the O&M costs of the proposed investment. While the enactment of the Local Government (Urban Councils) Act 1982 provided the legal framework for the reemergence of local authorities, much remains to be done to create the financial strength in the municipalities for self-sufficiency, at least for O&M functions (see paras. 1.27 and 1.28 and Section 4.A).",

This effort was complemented by the National Civil Service Reform, under which a retrenchment exercise was recently carried out in the project towns.

The scheme which had been successfully piloted in Arusha, Moshi and Tanga will be replicated in other towns. The results from the three towns indicate that the water supply sector operations can become financially sustainable through user charges in the short to medium term, possibly in 3 to 5 years (O&M cost only). Assurances have been obtained from the Government during negotiations that it will ensure that the UWSDs in the eight project towns and Dodoma will reach a billing and collection efficiency of at least 80 percent of all consumers by the time of the Mid-Term Review. To achieve this, the UWBSs in the eight project towns and Dodoma would at least annually review the water and sewerage tariffs, starting not later than six months after the Board members of the respective UWSB have been appointed (para 3.6), and adjust them as required to ensure that O&M costs are recovered by the time of the Mid-Term Review. The production and financial data from the beneficiary towns, including the pilot schemes, formed the basis of the projections and analysis. The project production figures for each town and projected average tariff have been used to estimate the revenues. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the cash flow streams of this component during the implementation and 15 years thereafter, at a twelve percent discount rate, is estimated at US$1.7 million (Financial Internal Rate of Return of 13%). This requires stiff tariff increases in some towns, annual increases of 30-35% in real terms. In case the tariff increases do not materialize at the expected levels or other unfavorable factors cause a 13% reduction in expected revenues, this NPV would become negligible. The net incremental revenues would, however, cover the incremental'\" O&M costs.

To pursue this objective, careful attention has been paid throughout project preparation that the design of the project and provision for later implementation would be conducive to this goal. The following analysis focuses on describing what were identified as the project benefits and risks, describing first the benefits and beneficiaries of the project, and where possible quantifying the benefits and calculating the economic rate of return. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for the project components with quantifiable benefits in order to identify the variables which pose the major risk to the success of the project. Before that, however, the project impact on public finances is assessed, since one of the most important lessons learned from project implementation is that projects often fail because there is a delay or lack of adequate Government counterpart funds.",

Current tariffs in the other towns are still at an average low US$0.09, and subsidies mostly go to the wealthy (see poverty analysis below). In all cases, however, tariffs for standpipes are projected to remain unchanged at US$ 0.04 / m3 so as not to increase the financial burden on the poor. This analysis has followed a conservative approach since it has not included in the calculation the cost savings derived by substituting previous water sources (e.g., water sold by vendors) and health benefits, which are difficult to quantify. 12 Demand projections are based on the consultants' estimates by class of beneficiary (i.e., standpipe, domestic, commercial, institutional and industrial).",

Under the project financing of water supply in six towns, new standposts would be constructed under arrangements whereby the communities manage the standposts.
