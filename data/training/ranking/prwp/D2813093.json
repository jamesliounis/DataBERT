  "abstract": "One of the key questions that naturally arise in discussions of education decentralization is how Federal education resources should be allocated among the various states and within states among communities or schools. In general, there are two approaches: (a) bilateral negotiations between the Federal government and states with little transparency as to the rules; and (b) formula-based distribution. This paper shows that, based on econometric analysis on Federal education transfers data in Mexico, the former approach can lead to allocation results that appear contrary to stated policy objectives like equity improvement and greater social inclusion in education. This paper then argues that contrary to common belief the use of capitation or per student allocation can improve not only efficiency but also equity. In this regard, a theoretical model is presented to analyze this hypothesis. Several variations of the capitation formula are discussed and analysis of the characteristics of the winners and losers of their application are presented, using Mexico as an illustration. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3171, December 2003 The Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues. An objective of the series is to get the findings out quickly, even if the presentations are less than fully polished. The papers carry the names of the authors and should be cited accordingly.

This is since past distribution patterns persist and, hence, inequities remain as the current formula depends almost totally on past year's allocation. States' accountability and incentives for performance and local contribution to education finance remain weak, if not absent. This paper shows that three formulae appear promising for the purpose of establishing an improved formula-driven interstate and intrastate allocation: i) uniform per student formula: simplest and most transparent; rewards enrollment, but does not explicitly address differential needs of states. II) Productivity adjusted per student formula: maximizes enrollment impact by giving more to states with high enrollment elasticity to subsidy; no equity assurance but at this stage of Mexico's development, it can be favorable to disadvantaged states since they now tend to have higher enrollment elasticities. And III) multi-component formula: divides total transfers into (a) core fund to be distributed on a per student basis; and (b) supplementary fund for extra cost of improving education of selected groups of disadvantaged children (poor, indigenous, rural) . This formula requires more information and is more complex; but it has the flexibility for ensuring a balance between efficiency and equity.",

It can be shown that under this situation, if the Government is aiming at maximizing enrollment, it should adjust the per student formula by factors reflecting the elasticity of enrollment with respect to the Federal subsidy of one state relative to that of another. The uniform per-student allocation formula is a special case that is obtained if the elasticities are uniform for all states. Lopez-Acevedo (1999a) shows that differences in enrollment elasticity among states can be significant at lower secondary education (see table 1 in the annex ). 1 It also shows that given the current pattern of coverage, states which lag behind in enrollment rate and income tend to have higher elasticities. This implies that under this formula those lagging states would be given relatively more Federal transfers per child. In other words, the states with the lowest enrollment rates are likely to show the largest gains for each additional peso of federal subsidy and thus should be favored, if higher overall enrollments and assistance to poorer states are the goals. Efficiency and equity objectives coincide. Thus Formula 2 adds an adjustment to the Formula 1 allocation based on the number of potential students in a state.",

This outcome is even more pronounced in Formula II as shown below. The implication is that since by design Formula II gives more to states whose enrollment elasticity is higher, equity and efficiency objectives coincide, as earlier hypothesized. To illustrate how the multi-component formula (Formula III) can be applied in a situation where learning achievement has become the predominant concern instead of access, the issue of interstate allocation of primary education Federal transfers was chosen.",

It is also necessary to estimate what the \"extra cost\" per student of the special needs of those children. In general, the \"extra cost\" consists of the extra costs of (a) providing access to these children and bovercoming their learning disadvantages. In the current exercise, only the \"extra cost\" per student of the above disadvantaged groups is being considered. Finally, to estimate the number of poor children, the marginality index of CONAPO was used, since it is not possible to get statespecific poverty rates based on income",

This is often proposed as a method for providing incentives to states to allocate more of their budget to improve basic education. This is an important issue to consider in light of the need to mobilize additional resources for the education sector and the decline in states' contribution to its finance. The use of matching grants, however, should be used carefully. First, if used alone, matching grants could widen inequality in education finance. Second, the approach suffers from the same criticisms mentioned above about the use of input-based incentives and allocation formula. Focusing on rewarding states' outputs, as proposed above, would be a better approach because it would implicitly reward states that are able to achieve output benchmarks regardless of whether they did it through increased efficiency or mobilization of additional resources (both monetary and in-kind). Still, used within a broader equity-oriented resource allocation framework (e.g. the above multi-component formula), special matching grants program can be a useful tool for motivating local resource mobilization. To be effective, though, subnational governments should have ample authority to levy local resources. This issue, which could involved fiscal mechanisms, will have to be examined in the context of the government's new federalism approach to governance. ",

First, even with the changes introduced by the government in the way Federal transfers are allocated, the need for improving the current allocation formula remains an important issue. The reason for this is that because the new methodology uses mainly an \"inertial formula\" (that is, states get at least the same amount of allocation as the previous year's, adjusted for the rate of inflation), past inequities tend to persist.Moreover, giving States budgetary increments based on the number of new schools and teachers needed tends to penalize more effective resource users and, hence, undermine efficiency. The second observation is that at present individual States have yet to confront the issue of intrastate allocation. Application of the above methodologies to this issue can be useful.",
