Evaluation of the statistical materials underlying these reports requires an appraisal of how economic reform has affected the capacity of China's statistical system to measure economic performance. Since industrial output dominates China's national income totals, possible inaccuracies in statistics of industrial growth have the potential to affect overall measures of the size and structure of China's economy u well as perceptions about the size, structure and growth rate of the industial sector itself. Of particular concern is the possibility that erroneous information about the rate and pattern of industrial growth will distort measures of productivity change, that we regard as central indicators of the effectiveness of industrial reform efforts in China's economy.",

        "text": "Data showing the level and growth of industrial output at both current and constant prices can also provide information about changes in the pdice level for industrial goods. This is particularly important because Chinese sources give no systematic information on price trends fer industrial goods until 1984/85; branch indexes for prices of industrial goods exist only ftwm 1985/86 [Chirna Price 2 (1989) : 59]. Implicit price indexets fer industrial output appear in Panel A of Table 1 . These data reflect the gradual emergence of inflationary pressures beginning in the mid 1980s following yeaws of near-stability in industrial prices. Whether these data acciiat'ly reflect trends in prices paid for industrial goods and/or received by industrial produce.\" will be discussed below. Table 2 indicates the brealkdown of output into several ownership ca.egories: state-owned, collective, private, and other. These figures show that output from the c )llective sector, particularly its sub-categories of township and vilage enterprises (jointly described by the tem xiangzhen Qa , has grown much faster than producton in state firms, leading to a rapid decline in the formerly dominant share of state firms in total output value. Table 2 are divided into two major sub-categories, state and coUective. Additional detail is given for two segments of collective industry, firms managw at the township (xi) and viLage (M) levels within the coUective sector. Since coUective enterprises also operate in urban areas, these segments do not exhaust the entire output of China's collective industries. Table 2 also displays output data for a separate category, xian3gzbhCnqy, which is often translIzted as *township and village enterprises' (abbreviated lVE), even though the term's literal meaning is 'township and market-town enterprises.' These data are of interest for two reasons: first, reported output has grown with extreme rapidity in recent years, so that the total amounts in 1987 to nearly one-third of national gross output. Furthermore, the scope of the TVE data remairs uncertain for the period beginning in 1984. Prior to 1984, the TVE output data are almost precisely equal to the sum of output value at fixed prices for township and village enterprises. Beginning in .984. however, we find a large and growing gap between output of township and village enterprises and the much higher TVE total. In addition, the price basis of the TVE data reproduced in Table 2 is not specified. We know that the data for 1978-83 represent the sum of output from township and village enterprise at constant prices. The enormnous growth of the TVE category starting in 1983/84 suggests that the. figures shown in Column E of Table 2 may represent outpu. valued at current rather than constant prices. Table 3 presents information on the branch structure of gross industrial output value at 1980 prices. These data, which exclude the minor category of non-independent accounting units and also exclude village enterprise, indicate very little change in the importance of major branches of Chinese industry during the past decade. This is confirmed by the rank correlation coefficient linking the size structure of industrial branches for combined state and collective industry (Panel How FA M Chha induy Orow? 5 C of Table 2 ) in 1978 and 1987.2 The stabi!tv of br-rch stricture in both the state and collective segments of industry is a significant factor in analyzing trends in reported energy productivity. A stable branch structure eliminates the ossibility of raising energy productivity by raising the share of industil output produced in branches with 'ow energy-intensity. Tables 1-3 arc based on the 'gross value of industrial output,\" which represents the combined total of enterprise output val6s inclusive of materal costs. Table 4 contains information on the growth of net industrial output, which is calcu1bted by subtracting the vaiue of material inpuu (minerals, semi-fabricates. energy etc.) from gross output. The net value figures are usually rendered only in current prices; when nret output is presented in constant price terms, the figures are apparently obtained by multiplying net output in current prices by the ratio of gross output totals Li constant and current prices, which is equivalent to \"single deflation rather than tU conceptually preferable \"double deflation\" used id contemporary industrial econormies, in which separate price indexes are used to remove the impact of price change from gross output and from the intermediate goods purchased hy industrial enterprises.",

An experienced accountant now working with a TVE machinery producer insists that even in the capital, failure to adhere to statistical regulations is not uncommon in the TVE sector; in rual areas, neglect of these systems is said to be widespread (personal communication, May 1989] . Officials of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB] agree that output data from TVE enterprises are problematic, that current prices are often used to calculate output values identified as based on fixed prices, and that the output totals tend toward bias in the upward direction (personal communication, May 1989; May 1990] . A position paper issued by the SSB in response to claims that its figures exaggerate the rate of industrial growth in recent years points specifically to rural enterprise as the chief source of what the SSB sees as a modest upward bias in its estimates of real industrial growth [SSB 1988; World Herald 1988 ]. An extenal researcher reports that visits to Jiangsu enterprises in the xiangzenQive category do indicate extensive mixing of data in current and constant prices, with enterprise leaders finding it difficult to explain which data are based on which prices (personal communication, July 1989] . A paper prepared by personnel at China's State Statistics Bureau [SSB 1988 ] reports that industrial units at the township (xiang level and above are required to submit monthly reports of GVIO at constant prices. The small, dispersed and numerous village-level, jointly operated (at or below villane level) and private (gi) enterprises submit only annual figures, and these are in current rather than constant prices. Provincial and local statisticai bureaux then adjust these submissions on the basis of coefficients derived from sample surveys or surveys of key enterprises. The SSB's position paper asserts that these procedures remove most, if not all of the shuifei (literally \"water content\") or upward bias from the output data associated with village-level industry. The SSB also points out that figures for these units are not included in monthly reports of industrial output [See World Herald 1988 for a summary of debate on the \"shuifen\"issue].",

Despite ample evidence that integration raises production costs, managers have persisted in building daerguan (large and complete) or i (smaUl and complete) manufacturing establishments in order to limit their dependence on unreliable external suppliers. Economic reform has increased the availability and reliability of external suppliers for a wide variety of commodities and services. There are many reports of new sub-contracting an-angements, inter-provincial joint ventures and other institutional changes that point in the direction of an increase in the overall ratio of inter-enterprise transactions to real output within the industrial sector. [Note, however, the apparent counterexample of the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, which has used new opportunities for independent decision-making to reduce its Even if there has been no trend toward inter-firm specialization at existing enterprises, the growing weight of rural and collective enterprises in the industrial output total has almost certainly brought a decline in average scale of industrial operations.

Tlhis conclusion is problematic because substantial intra-branch restructunng appears limited to a few branchesmachinery, chemicals, and perhaps textiles. This outcome draws attention to the possibility that a portion of the productivity gains repot.ed in Table 8 may be attrbutable to measurement error. To explore the possibility of measurement error, and also to investigate the branch pattern of cnange ip. sarmgy productivity, we turn to an examination of energy data for 15 branches of Chinese industry during 1980/85. Table 9 pnsents energy consumption data for 15 branches during 1980/85. Panel B uses these figures to derive annual percentage changes in energy productivity (GVIO/E, where E represents energy consumption in terms of standard coal) for 15 branches. These data conta a number of improbable items: can we believe, for example, that energy productivity in food processing rose by 27.3 percent during 1984/85, or that energy productivity in machine-building rose by 21.1 percent in the same year? How Fad Has CAsa Inr4ustry Oro, ? 17 We can investigate the consistency of the data for energy consumption (not shown) and energy consumption per unit of GVIO by extracting the implicit branch figures for GVIO and comparing them with GVIO data from other sources. Tis is done in Table 10 , which uncovers unacceptably large discre)ancies for branches 9-14 in the 15-branch clasification. Fortunately, data for the sectors that consume the largest quantities of energy, namely metallurgy, power, chemicals, building materials, and machine-building, are not involved in these inconsistencies. Table 11 presents a recalculation of EIGVIO and of annual percentage changes in GVIO/E for 1980/85 based on published branch data for E and on information from other sources giving branch time series of GVIO. These revised data show fewer improbable entries (readers should ignore the problems in branches 13 and 14, which should be merged in a future recalculation). These results suggest that, among the major energy users, machinery, chemicals and, to a lesser extent, metallurgy, have achieved considerable success in raising energy productivity, while electricity and building materials have recorded much smaller gains.",
