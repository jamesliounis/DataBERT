        "text": "One of the most notable developments in the world economy over the past thirty years is the rise of China and India as world economic powers. 1 Although they still lag behind in many respects, their financial systems have also developed rapidly. 2 In particular, following a period of significant reforms and financial liberalization initiated in the early 1990s, their financial systems have become much deeper according to several standard measures. For example, stock market capitalization increased from 4 (22) percent of GDP in 1992 to 80 (95) percent of GDP in 2010 in China (India). By 2010, 2,063 and 4,987 firms were listed in China's and India's stock markets, respectively. Moreover, their financial systems have transitioned from a mostly bankbased model to one where capital (equity and bond) markets have gained importance. For example, capital markets in China (India) have expanded from an average of 11 (57) percent of the financial system in 1990-1994 to an average of 53 (65) percent in 2005-2010. 3 Non-bank institutional investors also have started to play a more central role, channeling domestic savings and fostering the growth in capital markets. 4 In this paper, we study the extent to which firms in China and India have used and have benefitted from this expansion in capital markets to obtain financing and grow. First, we examine the expansion in equity and bond markets over the past two decades and study whether their overall increase in size has implied a widespread use of these markets by the financial and non-financial private sector. Because under financial liberalization transactions take place both domestically and abroad, we also evaluate the use of foreign capital markets. Second, we characterize which firms obtain financing from capital markets. Third, we analyze whether the use of capital market financing is associated with changes in firm performance around the capital raising activity. Fourth, we study the implications of the changes in firm size and growth for the firm size distribution (FSD) of listed firms.",

We particularly focus on the recurrent use of equity and bond markets among publicly listed firms (after their Initial Public Offering or IPO). 5 To do so, we compile transaction-level information on new capital raising issues of common and preferred equity from 1990 to 2011 and on corporate bond issues from 2000 to 2011 from Thomson Reuters' Security Data Corporation (SDC) Platinum database. We then match the SDC Platinum data on the use of capital markets with the Bureau van Dijk Orbis data on annual firm-level balance sheet information for publicly listed companies from 2003 to 2011. 6 Our matched data set comprises 2,458 firms from China and 4,305 firms from India, out of which 1,915 and 3,428 firms, respectively, did not have any equity or bond issues between 2003 and 2011.",

        "text": "Two main broad features emerge from our analysis. First, our results suggest that the expansion of financing to the private sector in China and India has been much more subdued than what the aggregate numbers suggest. Although capital raising activity in equity and bond markets expanded substantially in 2005-2010, it remained small as a percentage of GDP. 5 Our focus on publicly listed firms provides us with a more homogeneous group of firms that, vis-\u00e0-vis non-listed firms, are large, have already met the costly listing requirements, and are formal corporations that can raise capital. 6 We also use the Thomson Reuters' Worldscope database to obtain information on capital expenditures and to check the robustness of the results. Importantly, such expansion has not been associated with a widespread use of capital markets by firms. For example, the amount of capital raisings through equity issues in domestic markets doubled in China (from 0.5 to 1 percent of GDP per year) between 2000-2004 and 2005-2010, whereas the number of firms using these markets to raise capital per year increased only 20 percent (from 87 to 105 out of 1,621 listed firms) over the same period. On a smaller scale, similar patterns apply to the use of foreign markets. Also, not only have few firms used equity and bond markets on a recurrent basis, but even fewer firms capture the bulk of the capital market financing. 7 For instance, the top 10 firms in China and India captured between 43 and 62 percent of the total amount raised in 2005-2010. Thus, our findings suggest that capital markets have not been a significant source of financing across firms, which contrasts with the perception in the literature that equity markets, particularly in India, are well-developed.",

        "text": "Second, our results show that firms that use equity or bond markets are very different and behave differently from those that do not use capital markets. While non-issuing firms in both China and India grew at about the same rate as the overall economy, issuing firms grew twice as fast in 2004-2011. In fact, firms that raise capital are typically larger initially and become even larger than non-issuing firms after raising capital through equity or bonds. Firms grow faster the year before and the year in which they raise capital. 8 Moreover, firms that use capital markets have ex-ante a longer liability maturity structure and more capital expenditures, and the differences relative to the firms that do not use capital markets become more accentuated expost. Notably, all these differences between users and non-users are associated with the 7 These findings are consistent with a growing literature that highlights that the top firms in a country play a particularly important role in more aggregate outcomes. See for example Gabaix (2011) , Eaton et al. (2012) , Freund and Pierola (2012) , and di Giovanni and Levchenko (2012). 8 These findings contrast with those in Shirai (2002a and 2002b) , which state that the equity markets in China and India failed to improve firm performance during the 1990s. Our results, instead, indicate that the use of equity (and bond) markets during the 2000s is associated with improved firm performance around the capital raising activity. probability of raising capital. Furthermore, the evidence on firm size and growth has important implications for the FSD of listed firms. Quantile regressions show that the distribution of issuing firms is tilted to the right and shifts more over time than the distribution of those that do not issue, suggesting little convergence in firm size across listed firms.",

First, a large number of studies argue that financial development is positively associated with overall economic growth. 9 Most of this finance and growth literature focuses on the size of the financial systems by analyzing aggregate measures. This paper contributes to this literature by studying how widespread the use of capital markets by firms is, as well as the firm dynamics around the capital raising activity, in comparison to a relevant control group of publicly listed firms. 10 Our results suggest that equity and bond financing is associated with firm growth, and thus shed light on the channels through which financial development and growth are related.",

China is the most cited counter-example to this literature because it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and it is not clear which sources of financing propel the fast growth of its private sector. Private firms might have been able to grow rapidly because of their profitability and abundant cash flows (Guariglia et al., 2011, Hale and Long, 2011a) , as state-owned banks have been perceived to favor the state-owned corporate sector (Boyreau-Debray and Wei, 2005 , Hao, 2006 , Linton, 2008 , Cull et al., 2009 . Informal sources of financing might be important 9 Levine (2005) offers a review of the growth and finance literature. 10 There is relatively little evidence on how firms perform when they raise capital in equity or bond markets. Some of the exceptions are Demirguc- Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) , Claessens and Schmukler (2007) , and Gozzi et al. (2008 Gozzi et al. ( , 2010 . (Allen et al., 2005 ), but a firm-level survey suggests that bank financing has spurred firm growth (Ayyagari et al., 2010) . 11 Evidence at the provincial level indicates that capital market depth is positively and significantly associated with provincial growth, though bank depth is usually not (Hasan et al., 2009) . Our findings complement the existing papers and provide evidence on the positive association between the use of capital markets and firm performance.",

Although the growth of large firms seems independent of their size, including smaller firms in the analysis typically introduces a negative relation between growth and firm size (Lotti and Santarelli, 2004, Coad, 2009) . Moreover, the distribution of young firms is skewed to the right (most of the mass is on small firms) and the skewness tends to diminish monotonically as firms age and become larger (Cabral and Mata, 2003, Angelini and Generale, 2008) . Our findings suggest that even among the publicly listed firms, which consist of the largest firms within a country, there is some heterogeneity: firms that use capital market financing are larger to begin with and grow faster than non-users. In fact, our results indicate that there is no convergence in firm size; if anything, the distributions seem to diverge. The results seem consistent with the rapid growth within large plants in India (Bollard et al., 2013) . Moreover, a misallocation of capital in China and India Klenow, 2009, 2012 ) might have kept large, highly productive firms artificially small, which might explain why they are the ones that grow the most when financing becomes available.",

Each of these measures captures different conceptual aspects of the firm dynamics and can be influenced by different factors. For example, sales and total assets are affected by inflation and exchange rate dynamics, whereas the number of employees is not. Another example is an increase in productivity, which can lead to sales growth without parallel increase in employees or assets.

Both countries have also relaxed the rules and regulations for companies to raise capital in equity and bond markets and for domestic and foreign investors to invest in capital markets. Given this background, we next examine the evolution of commonly used aggregate indicators of financial sector development. We then analyze the extent to which the development of the financial system has implied a more widespread use of capital markets as a source of financing for corporations. 18 Although survivorship bias could arise in different ways, we believe that it is not affecting our conclusions. This bias could appear if, for example, risky firms that raise capital de-list or die and are not covered in our sample. Then, we would tend to overestimate the effects of the capital raising activity because we would not observe their poor performance. However, it could be the case that more established, blue-chip firms are the ones that raise capital through equity and bonds. Not observing firms that de-list or die (which to do not tend to raise capital in this instance) would lead to an overestimation of the performance of the control group, and we would thus tend to underestimate the difference between the treated and the control group. Ex-ante, it is difficult to know whether and how survivorship bias might affect our results. However, our results suggest that the potential for an upward bias in our estimates due to survivorship bias is limited. First, our results suggest that the more established firms are the ones that raise capital and that the ones that are more likely to de-list or die belong to our control group. Second, we obtained information on de-listings during our sample period from Bloomberg. Only a small fraction of the de-listed firms (about 10 percent) actually raised capital through bonds or equity, and 90 percent of those firms that raised capital are covered in our SDC-Orbis matched data set. The de-listed firms that raised funds in capital markets but that are not included in our data set represent in fact around 3 percent of the firms that raised capital and are included in our data set. Moreover, our SDC-Orbis matched data set covers only 23 percent of the de-listed firms that did not raise capital. The omission of these firms suggests that we might be overestimating the performance of our control group and therefore adding a downward bias to our results. Third, we obtained similar results using the Worldscope data, as further described in Section 4.3. Noticeably the post-issuance growth rates are positive and statistically significant, which suggests that our findings of a significant difference between the treated and the control group represent a lower bound of the effects of capital raising activity on firm performance.",

Similarly to the trends in domestic markets, new capital raisings in foreign markets also declined during the 1990s and then significantly increased in the second half of the 2000s. Nonetheless, foreign markets have come to represent a sizeable share of the equity financing, especially for Chinese firms (Figure 2 , Panel A). Noticeably, capital raising activity by Chinese firms in Hong Kong SAR, China alone was almost as large as that observed in domestic markets between 2005 and 2010. Total foreign equity financing represented over 50 percent of the total equity financing for firms from China and 22 percent for firms from India. However, trading activity remained concentrated in domestic markets, as suggested by the data for firms with depositary receipt (DR) programs. A direct comparison of the secondary market activity for these firms indicates that most of the trading during the 2000s took place in domestic markets. For example, less than 20 percent of the total trading of Indian firms took place in foreign equity markets (Appendix Figure 1) . Similar to the observed trends in equity financing, activity in primary bond markets increased significantly during the 2000s (Figure 2 , Panel B). Bond financing in domestic markets expanded by more than seven-fold in China and by more than three-fold in India in the 2005-2010 period vis-\u00e0-vis the 2000-2004 period, reaching about 2 percent of GDP per year in each country. We also observe an increase in the use of foreign bond markets, with an expansion of about 100 percent for both Chinese and Indian firms. Paralleling the developments in foreign equity financing, Hong Kong SAR, China also represented an important foreign market for the bond financing of Chinese firms. However, foreign financing remained only a small fraction of the total capital raising activity through bond markets, about 17 percent in India and 9 percent in China in the second half of the 2000s.",

Among issuing firms, there is a high degree of concentration with top issuers typically capturing a large fraction of the market. In China (India), the amount raised by the top 10 issuers as a ratio of the total amount raised per year during the In sum, the results based on firm-level data on the use of capital markets suggest that the expansion of financing to the private sector in China and India has been much more subdued than what the aggregate numbers suggest. The expansion of equity and bond market capitalization has not been associated with a more widespread use of capital markets by corporations. In fact, financing through capital markets has been channeled to relatively few firms and markets have remained highly concentrated, with few firms capturing an increasing amount of equity and bond financing. In other words, the deepening of equity and bond markets (measured by their expansion in absolute and relative size) has not led to a greater breadth of markets. Moreover, not only do few firms have used equity and bond markets on a recurrent basis, but also the bulk of capital market financing in China and India has been concentrated around few firms. These patterns suggest that capital markets have not provided a stable source of firm financing, which contrasts sharply with the perception in the existing literature that equity markets, particularly in India, are well-developed. Moreover, the patterns are particularly interesting if one considers that part of the financing in capital markets has gone to the SOEs and that a significant fraction of the growth in these countries might have come from more efficient private firms that displaced the SOEs (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009) .",

All regressions include industry dummies (leaving out as a base the dummy for the manufacturing sector) and time dummies. 28 Consistent with the evidence presented in the previous section, the results show that before it uses capital markets, the average firm is larger and grows faster, has a longer maturity structure on its liabilities, has more retained earnings as a share of total assets, has higher ROA, and invests more (in absolute terms and relative to sales) vis-\u00e0-vis non-user firms and other years for the user firms (Table 3) .

The capital expenditures also become even larger (though not as a share of sales) and the capital structure is longer in the post-issuance period, and these differences are statistically significant.",

Therefore, the differences between the firms that raise capital abroad and those that do not raise funds in capital markets seem to be much stronger than those currently reported in the paper. Third, firms with M&A activity around the capital raisings display a similar performance than other firms raising capital (Appendix Table 5 ). In particular, firms engaging in M&A are usually not larger and do not grow faster ex-ante or ex-post than other firms raising equity or bonds.

We include industry dummies in the regressions (leaving out as a base the dummy for the manufacturing sector). The constant is thus interpreted as the level of the \u210e quantile of firm size in 2003 for a firm in the manufacturing sector. The coefficient on the 2010 dummy represents the change in the location of that quantile between 2003 and 2010. 31 The coefficient on the dummy for capital market users captures the change in the location of that quantile between users and non-users.

For example, after taking into account the initial differences between users and non-users, equity users from the manufacturing sector at the bottom of the distribution in China had an additional expansion of their total assets of almost 170 percent in real terms between 2003 and 2010 (about $162 million) than the observed shift for non-users.

The fact that firms grow more rapidly just before raising capital suggests that this might be the case. Namely, firms might have more business opportunities that propel their growth, which leads them to seek more capital to sustain their expansion through new investments. However, supply side effects are also usually at work and fluctuations in financial activity typically have real effects. For example, shocks to global mutual funds seem to have a real impact on investment growth rates in China and India (Jotikasthira et al., 2012) .

As an additional robustness exercise, we also estimate fixed-effect panel regressions to explore the within variation among users of capital markets. The results are also broadly consistent with the ones reported here.28 The use of time dummies allows us to control for common factors driving firm performance in a given year, such as the possible market timing associated with capital raising activity. For example, firms might issue capital during stock market boom years and subsequently underperform as market conditions deteriorate. Heterogeneity among investors could be one of the explanations why some investors might be willing to invest in these firms even when they underperform(Campbell et al., 2012).",

This corresponds to about 21 percent of the Chinese firms and only 6 percent of the Indian firms raising equity capital. With regards to bond markets, SOEs captured not only a more sizeable share of the volume raised (especially in India), but also represented a larger share of the number of firms raising capital. For example, SOEs accounted for 63 and 50 percent of the total amount raised through bonds in China and India, respectively, which corresponds to 60 (26) percent of the Chinese (Indian) firms issuing bonds.",
