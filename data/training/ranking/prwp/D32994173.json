Overall, social transfers have been increasing continuously over time mainly due to the impact of aging populations on pensions as well as a consequence of expanding family programs targeting the poor and most vulnerable households (especially in the emerging world). In fact, on average, social transfers currently account for more than 50 percent of primary government spending in developed countries and about 40 percent in emerging markets (Galeano et al., 2021) .",

There are a handful of empirical studies for developed countries and no evidence of any kind for emerging markets. Existing empirical studies vary among several critical dimensions including the identi\u2026cation strategy, scope of the social transfer metric, econometric methodology, and country(ies) analyzed. Therefore, it is no surprise that there is little agreement in terms of the size of the STM. Estimates of STMs range between zero and one (Gechert, 2015; Alesina et al., 2017; Parraga-Rodriguez, 2018; Gechert et al., 2020) . Interestingly, among the few existing papers, there is a strong consensus that social transfer shocks a\u00a4ect output mainly through consumption rather than through investment (Romer and Romer, 2016; Alesina et al., 2017; Parraga-Rodriguez, 2018; Gechert et al., 2020; . This empirical fact points out that the primary mechanism behind the social transfer shock occurs through the government allocation of funds to agents with a high marginal propensity to consume, rather than through supply-side channels.",

The distinctive and essential elements of this family of models are the existence of two types of agents that di\u00a4er in their access to \u2026nancial markets coupled with a \u2026scal authority capable of redistributing funds between these two groups of individuals. 3 While unconstrained Ricardian agents have access to \u2026nancial markets and are, thus, able to smooth consumption, constrained hand-to-mouth (HtM, hereafter) individuals consume their entire income in each period and, consequently, have a higher marginal propensity to consume. The government collects lump-sum taxes from the Ricardian agents to pay for government purchases and social transfers to individuals. Naturally, if social transfers only reached Ricardian agents or if there were no HtM individuals, the STM would be equal to zero. The key to deliver a positive STM relies on social transfers actually reaching HtM individuals (i.e., the social transfer shock needs to redistribute funds from low-to high-marginal-propensity-to-consume agents) along with the existence of HtM agents (who help propagate the e\u00a4ect of the initial social transfer shock). Moreover, TANK models deliver STMs that are larger the higher the share of HtM agents in the population (which increases the average marginal propensity to consume of the economy) and the higher the share of social transfers reaching HtM agents (which increases the redistribution of funds from Ricardian to HtM agents). Among other relevant features, these models also allow monetary policy to be more or less accommodative (the zero lower bound being the extreme case of the former) and \u2026scal policy to vary the degree of persistence of government spending shocks.",

In particular, we use the well-known Blanchard and Perotti (2002) identi\u2026cation strategy that imposes timing restrictions by assuming that while government spending changes are allowed to contemporaneously a\u00a4ect economic activity within the quarter, it takes the government at least one quarter to respond to developments in the state of the economy. Although the identi\u2026cation of exogenous shocks continues to be a serious challenge for most empirical studies, we make signi\u2026cant e\u00a4orts to ameliorate endogeneity concerns and further guarantee the unanticipated within-the-quarter nature of the social transfer shock in the context of a local projections approach (Jorda, 2005; Stock and Watson, 2007) . In particular, we instrument cumulative changes in social transfers at each time horizon t + h using the residual at time t of a regression of changes in social transfers (excluding the unemployment insurance spending component) on the lags of a long list of macroeconomic variables including the changes of social transfers, GDP, total primary spending, \u2026scal revenues, and central bank interest rates. We exclude the unemployment insurance spending component from the social transfer metric used as instrument because of its inherent automatic and rapid response to developments in the state of the economy (McKay and Reis, 2016; Di Maggio and Kermani, 2016; Galeano et al., 2021) . We also perform several other exercises to reduce concerns about omitted variable bias. We \u2026nd that the size of the STM is three times larger in Latin American countries than in developed economies. While the STM is on impact 0.3 in developed countries, it is 0.9 in Latin American economies. In line with existing empirical papers based on data for developed countries, both samples also show that the e\u00a4ect on output is mainly driven by private consumption whereas private investment remains largely unchanged. We also \u2026nd that while the macroeconomic impact of social transfers is important in the shortand medium-term, it tends to weaken in the long-term.

Since Jorda's LP does not impose any restrictions linking the impulse responses at h and h + 1, estimates can display an erratic behavior due to the loss of e\u00a2 ciency. Additionally, the impulse responses sometimes display oscillations at longer horizons (Ramey, 2016). For these reasons, and to err on the safe side, we report estimates up to 8 quarters after social transfer shocks.",

While the STM in developed countries is 0.3 (t=2.0) on impact, it is 0.9 (t=3.8), in Latin American economies. 18 In both sets of countries, the peak is reached after one quarter, coming to 0.5 (t=1.5) and 1.1 (t=2.6) in the developed and Latin American sets, respectively.

While HtM agents' prevalence, , is a structural parameter considered to be outside of the \u2026scal policy scope and more related to the degree of economic and \u2026nancial development as well as economic policies in the \u2026nancial sector, social transfers targeting (ST T ) is a key aspect of \u2026scal policy. Moreover, while a large driven by a large (the extreme case being = and ST T = 0), shows that social transfers are able to reach HtM agents \"e\u00a4ortlessly\"as a byproduct of having too many HtM individuals, a large driven by large e\u00a4orts in social transfers targeting (i.e., ST T 0) indicates that a certain targeting e\u00a4ort is able to explicitly identify and reach those agents that are actually \u2026nancially constrained.

Second, and using information on whether individuals have a standing property loan, there is strong evidence that wealthy HtM individuals are also present in emerging markets (and not solely in developed countries).

Panel A shows the size of STMs both for the developed and Latin American countries. Panel B presents the di\u00a4erence in STMs between these two groups. Panel A shows that the calibrated TANK model is largely able to account for the observed empirical evidence. The TANK model delivers much larger STMs for the Latin American sample than for the developed one. Lastly, we now allow other parameter values (other than and ) to be calibrated for Latin American countries. In particular we follow De Mello and Moccero (2011) who \u2026nd more accommodative Taylor rules in Latin America (in particular, = 1:19, Y = 0:01, and R = 0:61). Other parameter values are selected as follows for Latin American countries: discount rate = 0:988, sticky wage elasticity \" w = 10:50 (matching 10% unemployment rate), steady-state government purchases G ss = 0:19 (from World Development Indicators), and capital share = 0:35 (in order to match K/Y from KLEMS). Since macroeconomic and in \u2021ation volatility is larger in emerging markets, the price-setting behavior in those countries is less rigid (see Barros et al., 2009, for Brazil) . For this reason, we calibrate a higher frequency of price adjustments in developing countries (1.5 times a year relative to once a year in the developed world). This implies Calvo probabilities p = w = 0:625.",

In this sense, social transfers seem to provide an inclusive manner to deal with temporary and deep recessions, like during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, because most of the e\u00a4ect of a social transfer shock impacts the economy especially in the short-and medium-run (as opposed to having truly long-lasting e\u00a4ects) and through private consumption (as opposed to via increasing the economy's productive capacity and investment), this type of \u2026scal policy tool is far from ideal to increase long-term growth and productivity.

In particular, the quantitative STMs would have been 0.83 for the developed countries and 1.42 for the Latin American economies.3 3 The long-run multiplier is de\u2026ned as the discounted sum of changes in output divided by the discounted sum of changes in social transfers.",

The visual impression is striking: a majority of blue bars lie to the left of the \u2026gure and the majority of red bars lie to the right (indicating a larger share of HtM individuals in emerging countries). In fact, the average share of HtM individuals is twice as large in emerging countries as in developed countries (47.5 percent vs. 23.8 percent, with a statistically signi\u2026cant di\u00a4erence). For our sample of six Latin American countries, the average share of HtM individuals is even larger, reaching 60 percent. 25While using a di\u00a4erent period of coverage, measure, and identi\u2026cation strategy, this evidence seems to match fairly well that of country-speci\u2026c studies. For example, for Mexico, we \u2026nd that 72 percent of individuals are HtM and Cugat (2019) \u2026nds that for years 2016-2018 about 58 percent of Mexican households have no access to formal \u2026nancial markets.

For Korea, we \u2026nd that 20 percent of individuals are HtM and Song (2019) \u2026nds that 2 4 In the case of the United States, this 1/20 of GNI per capita in local currency for the year 2017 was equivalent to 2,380 dollars which is very similar to Lusardi et al.

        "text": "The quantitative STM delivered by the model on impact is 0.21 in developed countries and 0.92 in the Latin American sample. Notably, these results are well within the reported 90 percent statistical range associated with the empirical STM estimates which are associated with STM point estimates of 0.31 in developed countries and 0.90 in the Latin American sample.32  As observed in the empirical estimates, most of the macroeconomic e\u00a4ect of the social transfer shock is driven by the reaction of private consumption as opposed to private investment. In other words, much like the \u2026ndings of papers focused on developed countries, the e\u00a4ect on output mainly occurs through consumption while private investment remains virtually unchanged. Panel B shows, now focusing on the di\u00a4erence in size of STMs, that \u2026ndings from Panel A imply that the model also accounts for the observed di\u00a4erences between these two groups of countries. For example, the di\u00a4erence in the e\u00a4ect of social transfers on output based on the model is 0.71 (second dotted grey bar) which is well within the reported 90 percent statistical range associated with the empirical evidence of 0.58 (\u2026rst solid grey bar).Four other aspects of the quantitative TANK model results are worth noting. First, the longrun multiplier is also about 4 times larger in Latin American countries (with a STM equal to 0.15) than in the developed sample (with a STM of 0.04). 33 Second, as shown inFigure 7, the model is also able to match quite well the temporal pro\u2026le depicted in the empirical estimates of Section 2. In fact, the rank-correlations observed in GDP, consumption, and investment between the quantitative results of the model and the empirical estimates range between 0.73 and 0.95 (in all cases statistically signi\u2026cant). Panel A shows that the STM is, on impact, four times larger in Latin American countries than in developed economies. Panel B shows that private consumption increases in response to a positive social transfer shock (especially in Latin American countries) due to the redistribution of funds from low to high marginal propensity to consume households.Investment decreases in both developed and Latin American countries given that as in \u2021ation goes up, monetary policy reacts by increasing the real interest rate (i.e., > 1). In \u2021ation increases more in Latin American countries due to the greater change in aggregate demand (i.e., higher ) and, therefore, the larger the increase in the real interest rate, the larger the drop in investment.Third, we now analyze how much of the di\u00a4erence in the e\u00a4ect of social transfers on output depicted by the model (i.e., 0.71) re \u2021ects the prevalence of HtM individuals, , vis-\u00e0-vis the \u2026scal targeting e\u00a4ort aimed to reach HtM individuals beyond their population representation as depicted by the ST T (recall that ST T). Recall that while the share of HtM agents, , is a structural parameter considered to be outside of the \u2026scal policy scope and more related to thedegree of economic and \u2026nancial development as well as economic policies in the \u2026nancial sector, social transfer targeting, ST T , is a key aspect of \u2026scal policy, especially determined by . Naturally, since in the benchmark parametrization only and are allowed to vary, these two mechanisms jointly account, by design, for all the di\u00a4erence in the e\u00a4ect of social transfers on output depicted by the model. Also recall that, as discussed in Subsection 4.3, based on a large sample of countries, generally , which in turn implies that ST T 0. That is to say, when considering the universe of all types of social transfers, countries'ability to reach HtM individuals seems to mainly re \u2021ect the prevalence of HtM individuals, , as opposed to a \u2026scal targeting e\u00a4ort aimed to reach HtM individuals beyond their population representation (i.e., there is very little social transfer targeting). This global regularity does not escape to our developed and Latin American samples where Developed = 0:23, Latin America = 0:60, ST T Developed = 0:02 and ST T Latin America = 0:05. While Latin American countries have a much larger share of HtM individuals, , than developed countries, social transfers targeting, ST T , is very similar across both samples of countries. 34 It should prove no surprise then that while the di\u00a4erence in the share of HtM individuals, , explains 91 percent of the STM size di\u00a4erence between developed and Latin American countries, the share of social transfers reaching them, ST T , explains 9 percent of such di\u00a4erence. 35 In other words, when considering all types of social transfers, Latin American countries depict large STMs mainly as a consequence of having, unfortunately, a large part of its population being HtM individuals as opposed to a particularly exceptional targeting of social transfers. 36",

This implies that about 12 percent of the overall di\u00a4erence in the e\u00a4ect of social transfers on output depicted by the model (i.e., 0.71) is explained by other parameter di\u00a4erences between developed and Latin American countries.37    To sum up, a standard calibrated TANK model is able to match key STM empirical regularities shown in Section 2 in terms of the crucial role of the higher share of \u2026nancially constrained individuals who live HtM in the Latin American sample relative to the developed countries has in explaining the large di\u00a4erence in the size of STMs previously estimated as well as regarding the main macroeconomic variables involved, and temporal pro\u2026le for both the developed and Latin American samples.",

The data are collected in partnership with Gallup through nationally-representative surveys of more than 150,000 adults in over 140 economies (i.e., covers about 1,000 individuals per country as in Lusardi et al. 2011). Global Findex has been published every three years since 2011. We use its latest survey for the year 2017 because it allows one to identify all types of social transfers. Previous surveys of 2011 and 2014 did not include public pensions (this is of particular importance for our paper because the empirical evidence shown in Section 2 includes all types of social transfers). The country samples were designed to be nationally representative and were subsequently weighted to re \u2021ect each country's population. Given the focus on emerging markets and developed countries, we exclude from our descriptive analysis what the IMF classi\u2026es as \"low-income developing countries.\"In total, we end up with 99 countries (including those 23 countries of our developed and Latin American sample). In particular, the Global Findex database includes two sets of questions to each surveyed individual which are essential for our purposes of measuring and : Question FIN24 asks: \"Now, imagine that you have an emergency and you need to pay [1/20 of GNI per capita in local currency]. Is it possible or not possible that you could come up with [1/20 of GNI per capita in local currency] within the next month?\"The possible answers were \"yes\" or \"no\".24  We use this question, like in the second group of studies which rely on self-assessed measures of capacity to deal with \u2026nancial shocks, to calculate the share of HtM",
