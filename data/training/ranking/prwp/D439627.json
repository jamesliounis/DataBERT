Whereas in the past financial supervision tended to be organized around specialist agencies for the banking, securities, and insurance sectors, in the last few years a number of industrialized countries have moved to integrate these different supervisory functions in a single agency. Indeed an informal club of \"integrated supervisors\"comprising representatives from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the UK-met in Sydney, Australia in early May 1999 for the first time. They discussed issues of mutual interest arising from the application of the integrated model. In this paper these integrated agencies will be referred to generically as integrated financial sector supervisory agencies (IFSSAs).",

But it is not perhaps fully appreciated that three of the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) had adopted variants of the integrated supervisor model since the mid-1 980s. Finland has undertaken reform in this area but has not moved to a fully integrated model. It is pertinent to ask therefore what lessons can be drawn from their several years of experience with an integrated approach. While the UK FSA experience is too recent to yield lessons in the organizational and operational spheres, it too can shed light on the actual process of integration. Hence, taken together, Northern European experience can potentially provide a rich source of guidance for those countries contemplating a move to the integrated model.",

        "text": "Perhaps the most intense debate-both in the financial press and in academic circleshas taken place in the UK immediately in advance of, and subsequent to the establishmin.t of the FSA. This intensity was related in part to the fact that the Bank of England had estciblished a substantial banking supervisory capacity and had stressed, over many years, the need to keep monetary policy making and banking supervision in the same body. This, it was argued, enabled the sharing of market intelligence and led to some important synergies. Much stress u as put on the argument that monetary and financial stability are inter-related. Hence those in favor of An important issue in deciding to adopt a unified supervisory agency is to consider whether it should be concerned exclusively with prudential (ie. Safety & soundness) regulation, or whether it should also have responsibi I ity for conduct of business matters. This debate lies beyond the scope of this paper, although it should be noted that only the United Kingdom, of the countries surveyed, has created a unified regulator with both prudential and c .nduct of business responsibilities. regulatory and supervisory reform were required to put forth a very robust case. The main academic contributors to the UK debate have been Goodhart (1996) , Taylor (1995 Taylor ( ,1996 and Goodhart et al (1998) . The most recent rationale for the integrated regulator model can be found in Briault's paper (1999) . Outside the countries cited above there has been little serious debate but this might be expected to take place in the coming years. 2",

The supervision of the commercial banks was added to its responsibilities in the 1920s. Banking supervisior has thus never been formally part of the responsibilities of the Norwegian central bank, and ience the creation of a unified regulatory authority did not involve any significant dilution of the central bank's range of powers.

        "text": "Denmark established its IFSSA in 1988, two years after Norway. Like Norway's Kredittilsynet, the Danish Finanstilsynet was formed from the merger of its bankiirng and insurance regulatory agencies. It also has a similar range of responsibilities to the Kredittilsynet (see Box 2.2). As in Noiway, the banking supervisory authority had enjoyed a long history as an agency outside the central bank. It had also combined the prudential supervision of nion-bank securities firms as part of its responsibilities prior to the creation of a fully integrated agency. The evolution of Denmark's regulatory system is shown in Annex 1. However, the creation of the Danish IFSSA was largely an administrative arrangement, and there was no fundamental review of legislation governing its supervisory activities at the time of the merger. As such it operates under a number of different statutes inherited from predecessor organizations. The sector legislation has been adjusted and harmonized successively during the nineties. Similarly, its governance arrangements have not been fully unified. Sweden's IFSSA, also called the Finans Inspektionen, was established in 1991. Its range of responsibilities are similar to those of its sister organizations in the other Scandinavian countries (see Box 2.3) Its governance arrangements are similar to those operated in Norway, although with a less independent supervisory board. Once more the banking and insurance inspectorates had a long history, and the decision to merge them was taken against the background of enhanced bank/insurance linkages. A further factor was the desire to achieve economies of scale and to enhance Sweden's international presence (unlike either Norway or Denmark, Sweden is a member of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and therefore a regular participant in one of the leading international forums for regulatory policy.) In addition, the formation of Sweden's IFSSA was a response to the banking crisis which Sweden experienced in 1990-91. A final factor behind Sweden's decision was the observation that other Scandinavian countries had already adopted the integrated approach. 2.9 Against this background, Finland's decision not to adopt a fully integrated approach to supervision, despite many superficial points of similarity with the other Scandinavian countries, also means that it represents a useful point of comparison. To a large extent the Finnish system of regulation followed that of Norway, Denmark and Sweden until the late 1980s. As in the Scandinavian countries, Finland had for a long time regulated its banks through a Bank Inspectorate outside the central bank. This had acquired the responsibility for the prudential regulation of non-bank securities firms in 1979. However, the conclusions drawn fr)m their banking crisis by the Finnish authorities differed from those drawn elsewhere in Scaw&L'navia. Norway persisted with ilts integrated agency notwithstanding criticisms of its handling of the banking crisis, and Sweden adopted its integrated approach partly in consequence of i.s crisis. By contrast, Finland drew the conclusion that its bank crisis pointed to the need to enhance the linkages between its banking supervisors and the Bank of Finland, and to this end created the Financial Supervision Authority which is independent in its decisionmaking but administratively connected to the Bank of Finland. See organizational chart below (Box 2.4). Note that the FSA's organization does not have an administrative or personnel department because of the close administrative link with the central bank. 2.10 A further difference between Finland and the other Scandinavian countries is that compulsory private sector pension schemes are also a major component of its financial s3stem. Until recently they have been regulated together with insurance companies by a specialist bureau within the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. However, from April 1999 this respor sibility was transferred to a new specialist Insurance Supervision Authority. Our interlocutors in -inland argued that the structure of Finland's financial system, and in particular the issues surr( unding the regulation of the private pension schemes, made a fully integrated approach to re{ u: ation inappropriate for their country, at least for the foreseeable future.",

Unlike the Scandinavian countries, the UK is home to an international financial center and its domestic financial services industry is much larger, more diverse and less concentrated than in Scandinavia. Furthernore, the UK's Financial Services Authority is responsible for both prudential and conduct of business regulation, unlike its counterparts in Scandinavia which have focussed on prudential regulation only (see Annex 2 for an organization chart). Finally, the formation of the FSA has been undertaken as a radical, 'Big Bang' measure, bringing together nine existing regulatory bodies. By contrast, the Scandinavian integrated regulators were the product of a long process of agency consolidation, and were formed primarily from the merger of banking and insurance inspectorates. Nonetheless, the fact that the UK's decision to create an IFSSA has been taken against a very different background to that of the Scandinavian countries means that it can serve as a valuable point of contrast.",

Although the crises themselves followed a similar pattern, and appear to have had similar causes, their impact on the structure of regulation differed significantly between Norway an A Sweden on the one hand and Finland on the other. The Scandinavian banking crises followed a period of significant domestic overheating which was followed by the collapse of asset prices and severe recessions in each of the three countries. This macroeconomic picture was combined with the structural characteristics of a recently deregulated banking sector and poor micro-level risk control in the banks themselves to generate a severe banking sector crisis in all three countries. The crisis emerged first in Norway, where banks loan losses climbed from 0.7% of total loans in 1987 to 6% in 1991. Similarly, in Finland, loan losses rose from 0.5% in 1989 to 4.7% in 1992. The rise was most abrupt in Sweden which experienced a rise from 0.3% in 1989 to 7% in 1992. In Norway, the resolution costs of the banking crisis in 1991-92 amounted to NKr 19.2 billion (2.6% of GDP), while at the height of the Swedish banking crisis total commitments (including government guarantees) stood at SKr 85 billion (5.9% of GDP).

In theory the existence of a single regulatory agency also makes it much easier to extend its powers as new products emerge. However, there is also a risk in this, as some of the Scandinavian regulators have found. A single financial services regulator can suffer from a \"Christmas tree\" effect, in which heterogeneous responsibilities are gradually added to its range of functions.

FSA staff are employees of the Bank of Finland and all administrative services (e.g. accounting, personnel and training, administration functions, security services, publication services, translation services) are bought from the central bank.

First of all, the creation of a (comparatively) large, quasi-autonomous regulatory body has delivered a higher status for regulation within the governmental machinery than separate specialist agencies could have achieved. On the one hand this has meant that fears that a single integrated authority might be easier for politicians to influence have been counterbalanced by the enhanced self-confidence of the regulators themselves. On the other hand, integrated regulatory agencies appear to have been more successful than specialist agencies in securing the funding needed for the effective discharge of their responsibilities. Small specialist agencies -especially when they exist merely as bureaus of the Finance Ministry -can struggle to make their case in the annual budget round. As a result, all too often they are starved of necessary funding and their staff are remunerated at rates which are uncompetitive with the markets they regulate.",

By contrast, specialist regulators are inevitably only concerned with individual entities in a group, and no one regulator has the skills or powers to obtain a group-wide perspective. Secondly, integrated regulation should help eliminate the potential for regulatory arbitrage by financial conglomerates. By applying a single set of regulatory requirements across a diversified financial group an integrated agency should in theory be able to achieve greater clarity and consistency than specialist agencies, and reduce the scope for one set of regulatory requirements being evaded by transactions being booked elsewhere in the group.",

This had the disadvantage of preserving a sense of separate identity and culture amongst these different divisions, with the result that in a number of cases they seem to have communicated no rmore successfully than did separate agencies. On the other hand, more recent attempts to reorganize the integrated agencies along more \"functional\" lines (for example by distinguishing between larger, systemically important institutions and smaller, non-systemic institutions) have resulted in complex internal matrix management structures. It is too early to say whether these new organizational forms will deliver the benefits in the supervision of financial conglomerates which in theory an integrated supervisor should be able to deliver.

Second, once the integrated agency is in place there is a range of administrative and personnel issues that must be addressed. It is appropriate that these be done in the context of a well managed change program.

In other countries-the UK FSA is a good example here-a \"big bang\" integration was followed. There was a conscious decision to move ahead more quickly with the physical integration process even though the new the legal framework was not in place. As noted earlier this meant that there were a number of sub-optimal practices (such as reporting to old and new boards) that had to be retained for a time.

Proponents of this approach argue that the benefits of integration could be reaped in a fragmented structure by simply ensuring that there is a high degree of cooperation and information flow between the agencies. The pertinent counterargument is that delaying such a decision will serve to cement in place the existing structure and the separate cultures and systems that evolve.

The second main reason is a desire to respond to the formation of financial conglomerates. In the Scandinavian countries these primarily took the form of bancassurance groups; banking and securities markets activities had already been closely integrated for a number of years. In the UK the rationale was based more on the growing integration of banking and securities activities, with the development of bancassurance playing a subsidiary (albeit still significant) role. However, in all these cases there was a perceived need to bring greater clarity and consistency to the regulation of complex financial groups. In short, the need for integrated supervision tends to reflect the underlying integration of financial markets.",

The Scandinavian financial services sectors are highly concentrated, with comparatively few financial groups accounting for the preponderance of financial sector assets 8 , and there is little doubt that this has been an important contributory factor in the decision to establish a IFSSA. It was argued by some of our interlocutors that a highly concentrated financial sector points to the need for regulation to be integrated to provide a sufficiently strong counterweight to the economic power these groups might potentially exercise. A similar argument may also have influenced the thinking of the UK government in deciding to establish the FSA. Similarly, an argument for integrated supervision in transition or developing economies is that their financial systems also tend to be dominated by relatively few large financial institutions. A typical feature of many transition economies is a highly polarized financial system with a large share of their deposit and loan markets being accounted for by relatively few institutions. These institutions are not only able to exercise significant economic power but they often wield significant political influence as well. They are often state-owned or recently privatized, and in any case their links with the governmental machinery remain strong. In such an environment there is a clear case for a strong, centralized regulatory agency to act as a counterweight to the power and influence exercised by these groups.",

Financial conglomerates in the sense that they exist in the industrialized countries of Northern Europe are relatively rare in the developing and transition economies, and hence this argument would seem to be less important than it was for the Scandinavian countries or the UK. Transition and developing market financial systems remain bank dominated, with comparatively little role at present for either securities markets or non-bank financial intermediaries like insurance companies or pension or mutual funds. Hence diversified financial conglomerate groups which combine banking, securities and insurance business in approximately equal measures tend not to exist in these countries. None the less, the dominance of banks within these economies mean that they tend to be the most active participants in all forms of financial intermediation. To the extent that securities or insurance markets do exist, the primary institutions operating in them are usually banks offering a full range of financial services. This gives rise to a variation on the financial conglomeratization justification for the creation of an IFSSA. Given that banks are the central institutions in the financial system, with non-bank financial intermediaries relegated to a largely peripheral role, the case for integrated supervision becomes much stronger. In such an environment it may make sense for the organizaticrn which regulates banks also to regulate other types of financial intermediary and activity. This will help ensure that all of a bank's activities are subject to consolidated supervision by a regulator that is not inhibited from overseeing them by a lack of appropriate powers.",

Integrated supervision makes it comparatively difficult for potential problems to disappear through the gaps between regulatory jurisdictions. The financial sectors of transition and developing countries can undergo a process of rapid transformation, especially in the immediate aftermath of liberalization. The emergence of new types of financial intermediaries and new types of financial product may leave conventional regulatory structures struggling to keep pace. An instance is the emergence of finance and leasing companies, which can be the source of significant credit expansion in their ovn right. Excessive expansion by these companies was at the root of the Secondary Banking Crisis in the UK during 1973-74 and the Scandinavian banking crises of the early 1990s.

        "text": "4.10 If one or more of these factors points towards the creation of a IFSSA, then the c ecision tree requires a number of more specific factors to be considered. Of particular importance is the question of whether or not the central bank currently conducts banking supervisiorn. The formation of an integrated regulatory agency necessitates consideration of the crisis management arrangements that will be put in place. As already discussed, the Scandinavian experierce was exceptional in that banking supervision had never been a central bank function in these cc mtries. This meant that there has been comparatively little consideration of the implications for crisis management of the formration of an integrated agency. By contrast, in Britain, the F' A. was formed in part by the banking supervision division of the Bank of England. These circum stances resulted in a more formalized approach to the arrangements for crisis management than hl .d been the case in Scandinavia. For many of the transition and emerging market econornies the formation of an integrated regulatory body would similarly require the central bank to su:render some of its existing functions. In these circumstances, a more formalized approach to crisis management, based on the UK's arrangements, might be appropriate. 4.11 Also important is the question of whether or not the central bank has strong guaranitees of its independence. If it does, then removing banking supervision from its functions may have a detrimental effect on the independence and quality of the banking supervisory function (as noted in Box 3.1). This problem may be especially pronounced in the developing and transition economies where guarantees of agency independence from political interference can often be difficult to establish. In this case, consideration should be given to establishing the IFSSA as an autonomous agency with administrative links to the central bank, on the Finnish model. This model may have much to offer the developing and transition economies, given the role of the central bank in relation to the Finnish supervisory authority. Since central banks tend to be relatively autonomous of the rest of the governmental machinery, permitting them a major role in the budgetary, policy and appointments process for regulatory agencies might be a way of insulating the latter from the political process. However, the proposed structure would differ from the Finnish model in that all three sectors of the industry -banking, securities, and insurance -would be regulated by the integrated supervisory agency. On the other hand, balanced against this argument is the consideration that such an arrangement might implicitly be seen as extending the central bank guarantee of support across the whole financial sector with the associated consequences for moral hazard. Any institutional design on this basis must ensure that the relationship between the central bank and IFSSA is sufficiently arms-length to ensure that this perception does not develop.",

One aspect of the Scandinavian experience that it would be difficult to transplant into a transition or emerging country environment concerns the governance arrangements for their regulatory agencies. As noted above, the Scandinavian countries place substantial emphasis on the transparency of decision-making as the primary mechanism to ensure both the independence and accountability of their regulatory agencies. But this approach is premised on the existence of a political culture that prizes openness and transparency and in which decision-makers recognize the legitimacy of public scrutiny of their decisions. In many transition and emerging countries these preconditions are absent. This means that the governance mechanisms of their regulatory bodies need more careful consideration than has been given in some of the Scandinavian countries to date. This problem applies whatever the nature of the regulatory structure adopted, but it is arguably compounded by the decision to form an integrated supervisory agency. It could be argued that politicians or vested interests would more easily capture a single supervisory body than they could a more diverse regulatory system based on specialist agencies. Put somewhat crudely, a single Director General might be more easily suborned than would three. In the absence of central bank involvement, it will be necessary for the governance provisions of a single regulatory agency to cover such matters as the terms of appointment for the Director General and other board members; their term of office and conditions of dismissal; and ideally the role of two independent authorities (e.g. Finance Minister and parliament) in determining appointments. There should also be clear public criteria, stated in advance, according to which appointments should be capable of being justified.",

More problematic is the tendency to preserve existing institutional cultures, thus inhibiting the agency's ebility to function as a single integrated entity.
