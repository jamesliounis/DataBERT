        "text": "The control protocols that underlie public expenditure management have direct implications for a government's ability to pursue fiscal discipline and service delivery objectives. The literature recognizes the inherent challenge in balancing control with flexibility and that these two objectives are often in conflict with one another. This paper argues that applying a universal set of expenditure controls across all transactions naturally cannot meet both of these objectives. One the one hand, a regime with universal, tight ex ante commitment controls lends itself to prudent fiscal management but constrains the ability of service providers to react adequately to rapidly changing needs. On the other hand, loosening controls equally for all transactions would introduce fiscal risks. To overcome this conundrum, the paper argues for a paradigm shift: a purposeful policy shift that subjects high-value transactions to the full set of rigorous controls, while relaxing controls for low-value transactions that apply to important aspects of the service delivery sectors. Such controls could be built into the financial management information systems that facilitate transactions and institute these controls. However, the evidence suggests that these systems are frequently not deployed to their full potential. Flexibility is inadvertently inhibited where it is necessary without providing the controls for transactions that constitute a fiscal risk. Recognizing this problem, the paper develops a two-pronged, risk-based deployment strategy for financial management information systems: (1) deploy such systems to high-value transactions, and (2) use banking sector innovations for advance payments, such as smart cards or mobile money, to facilitate flexibility for low-value transactions without compromising the integrity of transactions or accountability.",

        "text": "The way governments manage their finances has important implications for their ability to deliver services to citizens while aiming to maintain a prudent and sustainable fiscal position. In his seminal 1998 paper, Allen Schick outlines three objectives of a public finance system: (i) aggregate fiscal discipline -that budget totals should be the result of explicit enforced decisions; (ii) allocative efficiency -that expenditures should be based on government priorities and on effectiveness of public programs; and (iii) operational efficiency -that agencies should produce goods and services at a cost that achieves ongoing efficiency gains and is competitive at market prices (Schick 1998) . To achieve such results, countries need to distribute and record financial resources in a reliable and timely manner so that they can be audited to ensure that money is being used properly (Andrews et al. 2014) . Thus, the way countries formulate and execute their budget has profound implications on whether and how fiscal discipline and service delivery objectives can be met.",

        "text": "During the budget execution process, spending is subjected to a set of rules that should ensure that it is conducted against appropriations in the budget and within a given budget ceiling. These processes and controls associated with budget execution are shown schematically in figure 1 (Pattanayak 2016) . What controls are applied to what transactions becomes a policy decision and affects how well the process lends itself to prudent fiscal management and service delivery. Financial management information systems (FMIS) play an important role in this process as they facilitate transactions and subject them to these controls. A core FMIS can be defined as an information system that supports \"budget execution, accounting, and treasury and cash management functions, and generates financial reports in a timely manner\" (U\u00f1a, Allen, and Botton 2019) . They allow government finance and accounting staff to carry out their day-to-day operational tasks. This enables them to plan, prepare and approve budgets, approve and verify commitments, issue payment orders and payments, monitor and report on financial resources collected, and develop appropriate resource allocation and borrowing strategies (Hashim 2014 , Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2018 , 2016 . As such, the potential of such systems to facilitate fiscal discipline, increase transparency, accountability, and participation, and ultimately improve the efficient delivery of services is widely recognized by the literature and practitioners alike. Dorotinsky and Yasuhiko (2002) map out the various avenues of how FMIS systems can contribute to the larger PFM objectives (Dorotinsky and Matsuda 2002) .",

        "text": "The implementation process of FMIS systems however tends to be complex and lengthy, and the contribution of FMIS systems to fiscal discipline and service delivery objectives at times indirect and distant. On the one hand, FMIS should instill fiscal discipline, through the application of budgetary controls in the budget execution process. However, any budgetary controls can only apply to funds routed through the system. Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen (2016) have found that frequently large expenditure items are not channeled through the FMIS, in which case any controls would naturally not apply to those budget lines and thus open avenues for engaging in expenditures that were not vetted through the legislative process. As such, even though countries have invested in checks and balances with FMIS systems that have adequate budgetary control features, there often remain fiscal risks (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2016) . The literature found a positive correlation between FMIS budget coverage and PEFA scores (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2016, Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017) , as well as a negative relation between FMIS budget coverage and the deviation between planned and actual deficits (Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017) . This clearly underpins the critical role of adequate FMIS utilization in fiscal prudence. On the other hand, FMIS systems should also facilitate a reliable and expedited flow of funds to spending units that enables the effective delivery of services. This service delivery objective may however not be aligned with the rigidities of the control regime applied to those transactions. Rolling out an FMIS with all its associated controls to the district or even facility level means that these agencies will not have the necessary autonomy to make spending decisions within a certain envelope as priorities change. Looking at the health sector, the World Health Organization and others have argued that rigid ex-ante control in a line item budget environment can hinder health financing objectives that necessitate a greater degree of autonomy (Cashin et al. 2017 , Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen and Schneider 2018 , Chakraborty et al. 2010 . Instead, an FMIS system at this level can inadvertently inhibit the flexibility that is necessary to deliver essential services efficiently.",

        "text": "Thus, \"the core challenge of good budget execution systems is how to balance control with flexibility\" (Schiavo-Campo 2017). This situation can be mapped into a control and flexibility quadrant, as developed in figure 2. Quadrant one, the south-eastern quadrant shows a situation where the budget execution system provides insufficient control and accountability yet instills the kind of rigidities in service delivery sectors that inhibit effective service provision. Countries that relax control for expenditure items that can potentially pose fiscal risks such as subsidies, wages and salaries, and transfers while imposing strict ex-ante control on line items at the service delivery level would fall into this category. Quadrant two displays an environment that allows for sufficient flexibility, in an environment of little control and accountability. Countries that use the budget execution system as merely an accounting software that records transactions without controlling them would fall into this category. On the other end of the spectrum, quadrant four captures countries with sophisticated systems that subject the entire budget to the same strict control regime, which may work for fiscal control but not service delivery. Quadrant three, the north-eastern quadrant, shows the desired situation, that balances well control and flexibility and thus facilitates progress toward the twin PFM objectives of fiscal discipline and efficient service delivery. This paper recognizes the critical importance of FMIS systems in expenditure management, without which the desired progress in fiscal discipline and service delivery may be difficult to achieve. Budget execution systems across all countries can be mapped into one of the above quadrants, and the challenge this paper seeks to address is how to navigate from a sub-optimal situation to the quadrant that facilitates both control and the necessary flexibility. This paper argues for a paradigm shift: to control for high-value transactions, while allowing for more flexibility for low-value transactions, without compromising accountability. The paper proposes utilizing innovations in the banking sector to maintain financial accountability for these transactions.",

Subjecting expenditure items in the budget to a rigorous automated control regime will ensure that the executed budget reflects the annual budget law as approved by the legislature. The diligent application of controls should ensure accountability and eliminate unbudgeted expenditures that undermine deficit targets or may lead to an accumulation of arrears. To achieve full control, full budget coverage is necessary. However, as FMIS rollout is costly and there are diminishing returns in terms of fiscal control. From an economic perspective, it may instead be preferable to deploy the system to a point where the marginal benefit (MB) of doing so equates the marginal cost (MC). Marginal benefit is defined as the change in total benefit over the change in quantity, and similarly the marginal cost is the change in total cost over the change in quantity:",

        "text": "To understand what the benefit and cost functions look like, it is helpful to visualize the transactions profile. A review of a large number of countries (Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2018, Hashim et al. 2019) has shown that the transaction profile tends to be skewed with few high-value transactions making up the majority of the budget. Conversely, there are many low-value transactions that cumulatively only account to a very small share of the budget. A rough estimation of this proportion is 20: 80, with larger countries being more skewed toward high-value transactions. In some countries, these make up 90-95 percent of the budget (Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen, Hashim, and Wescott 2017). A sample transaction profile for a typical lower-middle-income country is shown in figure 3. This shows on the same plot the cumulative share of the number and volume of transactions. For this specific country, transactions of US$200 or less make up almost 50 percent of all transactions but amount to less than 5 percent of the budget. Almost all transactions in the country are smaller than US$ 1,000 which still only make up 17 percent of the total budget. On the other side of the spectrum there are 7 transactions between US$10 million and US$50 million and 5 transactions that are over US$50 million. They constitute 0.003 percent of the total number of transactions yet make up over 50 percent of the volume transacted through the system. This suggests that there are very high returns in terms of fiscal control for capturing high-value transactions, but the return diminishes rapidly as the value of the transaction declines. As such the marginal benefit curve is steep and downwards sloping. Conversely, the marginal cost of rolling the FMIS out at the central level is relatively low. The IT infrastructure is available, power reliable, and human and institutional capacity higher to manage a complex system. However, the cost of decentralizing the system to regional administrations, districts and service providers increases rapidly. The cost function for the initial central transactions is therefore likely to be upward sloping and increasing sharply as the system is decentralized. The marginal cost of FMIS deployment and benefits in terms of budgetary control could therefore be visualized as that of an optimizing firm where MB=MC function (see figure 4). While theory would suggest that a rollout strategy should be pursued where marginal benefits equal marginal cost, this may practically not be easily identified. Instead, if a transaction threshold could be determined defining high-value transactions which cover 90-95 percent of the budget, it would be possible to target ex-ante control to these transactions. Such an approach could yield a very high budget coverage despite focusing only on a limited number of transactions. As it is critical to have comprehensive budget execution reports, all transactions executed outside the FMIS need to be posted to the ledger periodically on an ex-post basis and consolidated with the FMIS-generated transactions. In terms of the control/flexibility quadrant, following such an approach could shift countries from a quadrant with low control to a quadrant with good control at relatively low cost. Some practical implications of what this may entail are addressed in the FMIS deployment architecture chapter.",

Adjustments to the budget in due course may be possible, but the process of reallocating resources can be excessively cumbersome, requiring multiple upstream sanctions. Such processes may be warranted for large transactions but are an impediment for the effective delivery of services where at times quick decisions need to be taken. This restricts the flow of resources, and spending units may find it difficult to spend, despite having received allotments.

This process allows de-facto for the necessary flexibility, because a manual recording system does not impose the same control regimes. As such, flexibility is given. However, unless there are rigorous and frequent audits, this process loses accountability because it is very difficult to verify that what funds have been reported on spending is actually what they have been spent on. This is so, because the payment and reporting processes are not integrated. While the amount of funds is likely to be small and may not constitute a fiscal risk, this does not mean that there should be no accountability on how funds are being used. They still need to be spent prudently, be adequately accounted for and reported on as per government chart of accounts. This paper does not argue that accountability is not necessary -rather a strict line item ex-ante control regime for small value transactions could be relinquished, while retaining necessary financial accountability.",

A card or mobile money account could be given for the utilization of imprest advances, with limits equal to the release of funds for the Imprest head. Depending on the source of funds that payments are drawn from, it may be necessary to have more than one card, or mobile money account, to accommodate, for example donor payments. This would most apply to small-scale operating costs. Virement between large spending categories (e.g. payroll and goods and services) would still require approval process. Thereby the bank controls how much can be spent on a budget head but does not control how (e.g. what type of supplies) items are being purchased.

In many countries this type of flexibility is de facto already in place as they use manual or excel based systems, allowing them to capture and control spending ex-post but without the integration between the payment process and the recording process. There is thus little guarantee of the integrity of the expenditure data. An example of this is Malawi, where the lack of integration has undermined confidence in the system entirely (World Bank 2016a). With the increased penetration of the banking sector, an innovative approach integrating spending, recording, and the FMIS is possible, which would facilitate the same level of flexibility used in a manual system, while capturing all transactions and thereby guaranteeing good expenditure information. Using such an approach therefore would allow a shift toward the eastern quadrants where spending units have adequate flexibility, whist maintaining financial accountability. Such an approach will implicitly also lead to greater facility autonomy and should be recognized through an explicit delegation of power.",

Such a strategy could be a useful first step in implementing a reasonable budget execution system in countries that do not have one. For example, in the Philippines, the large number of spending units and the lack of a network of treasury offices charged with ex ante transaction control (which line ministries resist for all transactions) hindered all previous efforts at implementing such a system. In this environment, line ministries and spending units can open bank accounts in designated commercial banks. The government allows these spending units to process these transactions through the SU's bank accounts in these banks up to the limit of their cash allocations and the ministries and spending units make payments through these banks. The treasury single account at the central bank controls the budgetary resources, and the designated commercial banks claim reimbursement from the Treasury for amounts paid out on behalf of spending units. However, ex ante budget control is not practiced on these transactions, which leads to the problems described earlier. Therefore, if transactions above a transaction threshold are required to be paid through a central treasury payment system (which currently regulates only the cash locations to spending units), then an effective budget execution system could be established quickly without deploying the treasury system to all spending unit sites (which can number in the thousands). The banking network would still handle transactions below the threshold (and during the transition period), as is currently proposed for the Philippines. This strategy could also be useful for countries where state of the art systems has been put in place, but the budget coverage remains low. This strategy would require governmentwide approach, as it involves promoting the mobile money or point of sales for card payments in the economy to address the risk of insufficient point of sales or coverage of mobile money in the country.",

This is not always the case, and evidence suggests that some countries are reluctant to do so, precisely because they do not wish certain expenditure items to be subjected to FMIS internal controls. In Ghana and Zambia for example, wage payments were not routed through the system, and the FMIS was therefore unable to prevent ad-hoc wage increases that were unplanned and unbudgeted for, and subsequently caused a major fiscal strain (European Commission 2017, World Bank 2016c, b, Hashim and Piatti-F\u00fcnfkirchen 2018) . This points to the necessity to integrate payroll with FMIS controls for payments. Similarly, if other large transactions such as debt payments, subsidies, or transfers are routed outside the system, they bypass controls and therefore constitute a fiscal risk. The larger the share of the budget that is not subject to FMIS internal controls, the looser the expenditure controls the larger the likelihood that these can be manually manipulated. This also circumvents adequate legislative oversight and thus fundamentally undermine democratic processes. This in effect means that the Ministry of Finance remakes the budget during the year without getting ex-ante authority from the Parliament. This process is legitimized in some countries by getting the Parliament to agree and approve a revised Budget on an ex-post basis in as much as the law states otherwise. In discussions with the Parliament at this stage they are confronted with a de-facto situation on which they have little choice but to approve. This causes a serious reduction in constraints on the executive branch to make imprudent choices to either further their political agenda or, in some cases, pursue non-transparent objectives such as borrowing from 'favorite banks'.",
