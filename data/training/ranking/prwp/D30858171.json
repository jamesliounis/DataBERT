We use skill surveys from developing countries -i.e. the Skills Toward Employability and Productivity (STEP) surveys -to create indicators of the task content of jobs comparable to those based on O*NET for the US. 1 We find that both sets of measures are consistent regarding the relative non-routine cognitive (i.e. non-routine analytical and non-routine interpersonal tasks) and routine manual task content of jobs across countries and over time. However, occupations relatively more intensive in routine cognitive and non-routine manual tasks are not necessarily the same according to O*NET and STEP. This implies that the estimated trends in the task content of jobs will depend on whether the O*NET or STEP measures are used. In fact, while according to the O*NET indicators only one developing country in our sample shows evidence of job de-routinization, all the countries with sufficiently long-time coverage experience such phenomenon according to the STEP indicators.",

In particular, while a task is a unit of work activity that produces output, skills are the workers' endowments of capabilities to perform several tasks (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011) . Since the seminal work of Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) , there has been a steady increase in the number of articles studying the task content of jobs. For example, and Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2009) document the process of employment and wage polarization affecting labor markets in the US and Europe since the 1980s and 1990s. This process is characterized by job and wage growth being higher at the tails of the skill and wage distribution than at the middle. They argue that new technologies that allowed the automation of routine jobs (which tend to be in the middle of the wage distribution) and increased the demand for non-routine tasks (which tend to be at the top and bottom of the wage distribution) fostered this process.",

Even for developing countries, these studies use US-based skill measures such as the O*NET or other broader occupational categories. Using a broad occupational classification , World Bank (2016) shows that labor market de-routinization is pervasive in the developing world. In comparison, studies that used more detailed data on skills show a more nuanced picture. Hardy, Keister, and Lewandowski (2016) find that in contrast to the US, jobs that are intensive in middleskill, routine, cognitive tasks increased in most Central and Eastern European countries. They also find that improvements in educational attainment and a decline in the share of agricultural jobs, rather than technology, were the main drivers of these changes. Accordingly, Apella and Zunino (2017) find that the evolution of the skill content of jobs in Argentina and Uruguay was more similar to that of Central and Eastern European countries than to that of rich countries. Maloney and Molina (2016) use the same aggregate classification of World Bank (2016) and find that only in two, out of twenty-one, developing countries there is evidence of labor market de-routinization. Aedo et al. (2013) estimate trends for 30 countries at different stages of development and find that the share of jobs intensive in non-routine, cognitive tasks is higher in richer countries.",

Messina, Pica, and Oviedo (2014) analyze trends in the task content of jobs in four Latin American countries but do not investigate the drivers of such trends. Finally, Hardy et al. (2018) investigate the task content of jobs using country-specific skills surveys for 46 economies, mostly in the developed world. They analyze if the findings are different from those obtained when using US data from O*NET and investigate the drivers of the heterogeneity in the skill content of jobs across countries but not over time. They find that ICT capital intensity, robot use and the position of the country in the global value chain (i.e. a high share of foreign value added in the production of final goods and services) are negatively correlated with the share of routine jobs.",

The first one relies on occupational level task indexes estimated by experts, who rank occupations based on worker interviews. The O*NET data set is the outcome of such analysis for the US economy, with 44 different scores being assigned to each detailed level occupation. The second approach, instead, relies on direct worker-level information on the specific tasks performed on the job. It was pioneered by Handel (2008) , who developed and used the STAMP survey (that later became the PDII), for the US. This approach allows observation of the tasks at a more disaggregated level, making within-occupation analyses possible. Our methodology falls into this second category, as we employ task information at the worker-level, exploiting the STEP surveys for several developing countries. As our objective is to compare our findings with the counterfactual results that one would obtain using the US classifications, we employ two different specifications, each of which as close as possible to the O*NET and to the PDII specifications, respectively. Since the results using the PDII specification lead to similar conclusions to the ones we obtain using the O*NET one, we only discuss the latter because it provides a greater disaggregation of skill groups (5 vs. 3 ",

This is because in addition to changes in the ISCO over time, many countries use their own-specific occupational categories that are difficult to map to ISCO at finer disaggregation levels. Appendix 3 shows that while the level of aggregation may affect the estimation of the routine cognitive content of jobs using O*NET, it does not seem to lead to different conclusions for the other four skill categories. Figure 1 and Figure 2 display the relationship between the task content of jobs and the level of GDP per capita across countries included in the STEP sample, using the STEP-and US-based indexes, respectively. Both sets of indexes show similar patterns regarding the link between economic development and the content of non-routine cognitive skills. In particular, countries with higher levels of GDP per capita tend to have jobs with a higher content of non-routine cognitive skills. Both methodologies also suggest that GDP per capita is negatively correlated with the intensity of routine manual skills. In contrast, there are important differences with regards to the intensity of jobs in routine cognitive and non-routine manual tasks. US-based measures suggest that the intensity of jobs in routine cognitive tasks increases with economic development, and that the opposite is true for the intensity of jobs in routine manual tasks. However, STEP-based measures of non-routine tasks increase with economic development, and both routine manual and routine cognitive tasks decline with economic development. Note: Each point shows the skill content of jobs using STEP-based indexes per country and year. The horizontal axis measures GDP per capita in PPP from WDI. When looking at the total changes in the task content of jobs in all 11 countries, there are certain differences across countries and some key stylized facts emerge. In most countries, US-and STEPbased indexes show an increase in the non-routine cognitive content of jobs and a decline in the routine intensity ( Figure 3 ). However, while the non-routine manual content of jobs increased in seven countries according to the STEP-based indexes, only three countries experienced such increase according to the O*NET-based index. Moreover, in the countries where this index declined according to both measures (as in the Philippines, Serbia and Ukraine), the decline was smaller in magnitude according to the STEP-based index than according to the O*NET-based one.

        "text": "This exercise relies on the assumption that the task content of occupations of developing countries not covered by STEP surveys is similar to that of those with a STEP survey. While the data do not allow to test this assumption, we proceed by first checking if the basic correlations between the skill indexes and the level of GDP per capita still hold for the extended sample. Figure 4 and Figure   5 show the correlation of the skill content of jobs with the level of economic development, using the O*NET-and STEP-based methodology, respectively. The patterns are very similar to those of Figure 1 and Figure 2 , respectively. The non-routine cognitive and interpersonal task intensity tends to increase with the level of GDP per capita, while routine manual task intensity tends to decline. Accordingly, the non-routine manual content tends to increase with GDP per capita according to the STEP-based indexes, while the opposite is true for O*NET-based ones. While according to the O*NET-based index the routine cognitive intensity increases with the level of development, it declines when using the STEP-based indexes, which is more consistent with the findings for developed countries and the prediction that new technologies are more likely to displace this type of occupations. Since poorer countries are more likely to have a skill content of jobs more similar to that of other poorer countries than to that of the US, these correlations suggest that using STEP-based indexes provides more accurate estimates of the skill content of jobs for developing countries than US-based ones. When looking at changes over time, both measures show the same patterns with regards to the non-routine cognitive, non-routine interpersonal and routine manual task content of jobs ( Figure   6 ). The correlation is also positive, but considerably smaller, for the routine cognitive task content of jobs. However, O*NET and STEP measures do not necessarily lead to the same conclusions regarding the evolution of the non-routine manual content of jobs over time, since the correlation coefficient is relatively low.

We argue that changes in labor supply such as educational upgrading, increasing female labor force participation and the demographic transition could affect the skill content of jobs in the economy. The secular increase in educational attainment in developing countries could be one of the factors behind the rise of jobs intensive in non-routine cognitive skills, and the fall of low-skill jobs. The increasing participation of women in the labor force may also be an important driver if they are more likely to have jobs that are not intensive in physical work. Finally, the changing age structure may affect the skill content of jobs through different channels. First, aging societies may be more likely to incorporate labor-saving technologies (Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) ), and thereby more likely to experience a decline in job routinization. Second, a higher share of the elderly in the population may also increase the demand for certain types of goods or services that may be more intensive in non-routine manual tasks, such as the care industry. Third, given that lifelong learning institutions are not widespread in most developing countries, skills tend to be acquired through formal education before young people enter the labor market. Thereby, larger young cohorts would contribute disproportionately to the stock of skills in the labor force.",

Increasing exports may in contrast increase the demand for routine labor, since the tradeable sector is typically more intensive in this type of labor (Marcolin, Miroudot, and Squicciarini (2016) ). An increase in imports through offshoring may reduce the demand for routine labor.

While most articles impute US-based measures of the task content of occupations to other countries, we use harmonized data on the task content of jobs for 11 developing countries. We find that indexes based on the US and on developing countries lead to similar conclusions regarding the stock, changes and drivers of the non-routine cognitive and routine manual content of jobs. However, the former does not provide a close approximation of the routine cognitive and non-routine manual skill content of jobs. We also uncover three new stylized facts. First, while developed countries tend to have jobs more intensive in cognitive skills than developing countries, income (both in growth and levels) is not significantly associated with the skill content of jobs once other factors are accounted for. Second, while ICT adoption is linked to job de-routinization, international trade is an offsetting force. Last, ICT adoption is correlated with lower employment growth in countries with a high share of occupations intensive in routine tasks.",

Fourth, while new technologies may increase the skills intensity of jobs on average, they can displace routine workers with limited capacity to find another job. This highlights the importance of social protection systems, of reducing the barriers to job mobility and of strengthening lifelong learning systems to facilitate the process of finding a new job and protecting the incomes of displaced workers during a technological shock.",
