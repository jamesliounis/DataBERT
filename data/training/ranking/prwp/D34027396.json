        "text": "A 2021-22 survey of trade promotion organizations conducted by the World Bank to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their functioning suggests four main findings. First, trade promotion organizations in high-income countries are larger than those in low-income countries, suggesting a stronger capacity to adapt during the pandemic. Second, trade promotion organizations in high-income countries saw a significant jump in their median budget in 2021 indicating a strong response effort. In low-income countries, the budgets of trade promotion organizations declined. Third, most trade promotion organizations in high-income countries put in place a COVID-19 recovery plan, while none of the trade promotion organizations in low-income countries had one in place at the time of the survey. Fourth, trade promotion organizations used several virtual tools during the pandemic, such as business-to-business matching events and training of small firms on e-commerce, and are expecting to increase the use of all virtual tools post COVID-19. Trade promotion organizations' use of virtual tools in low-income countries remained limited..

It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world.

Global trade declined dramatically at the onset of the pandemic (Brenton et al., 2022) but trade bounced back sharply from late 2020 onward (Meijerink et al., 2020) . Surveys of firms around the world, namely the World Bank's Business Pulse Surveys, documented their responses to the COVID shock including their access to and use of government support programs (e.g., Constantinescu et al., 2022; Cirera et al., 2021) . Despite the key role of government agencies that promote trade -Trade Promotion Organizations (TPOs)-highlighted in a recent survey by Srhoj et al. (2020) , little is known about the impact of the pandemic on their activities. To address this gap, the World Bank implemented a survey of TPOs in 57 countries between fall 2021 and spring 2022 with the objective of better understanding their responses to a crisis such as the COVID pandemic as well as their functioning more broadly.",

However, as TPOs reformed, the more recent literature suggests that they can successfully promote exports when sufficiently funded (Lederman et al., 2010) , or when focusing on firms' extensive rather than intensive export margins, both at the market, product and exporter/non-exporter levels (Volpe Martincus and Carballo (2008) , Cruz (2014) and Broocks and van Biesebroeck (2017) ). TPO returns are also higher when they spend a large share of their budget on marketing activities in a few sectors (Olarreaga et al., 2020) , or when TPO activities are combined with investment promotion (Harding and Javorcik, 2012) .",

First, there is significant heterogeneity in TPOs' size in terms of budget: the budget of the median TPO in high-income countries is 20 times larger than that of the median TPO in low-income countries. TPOs' budget responses during the pandemic also varied across income levels: TPOs in high-income countries increased their budget whereas TPOs in low-income countries saw a decline in their budget even after lockdown measures eased. Second, TPOs in high-income countries have a stronger hierarchical structure with the number of board members per employee being eight times smaller than in TPOs in low-income countries. This could partly reflect the finding that TPOs in high-income countries tend to have broader mandates whereas TPOs in low-income countries mainly focus on export promotion. These two observations put together may be explained by the fact that a broader mandate may require a more hierarchical structure.",

        "text": "Third, TPOs target generally medium-size established exporters, rather than large or small non-exporters or occasional exporters. The focus on established exporters strengthened in high-income countries during the pandemic, whereas non-exporters became relatively more important in low-income countries. Marketing activities remained the main expenditure item of TPOs during the pandemic. However, its relative importance declined in low-income countries as the pandemic hit. This is partly explained by the fact that TPOs in low-income countries were not as quick to adapt to virtual tools such as business-to-business (B2B) matching events. Indeed, at the time of the survey, among low-income countries there was no TPO that had put a COVID recovery plan in place. Among high-income countries 59 percent had a recovery plan in place. Interestingly, one of the most popular virtual tools used during the pandemic in both high-and low-income countries was \"Training on e-commerce\" (as popular as \"B2B matching events\"). This was also the virtual program with one of the lowest expenditure shares, suggesting such programs are not only popular, but also relatively cheap.",

        "text": "These findings are important for three reasons. First, they help understand TPOs' structure, organization and objectives, and how those differ across income groups. It is, for example, surprising that TPOs focused mainly on established exporters. The existing literature has shown that returns to export promotion are higher along the extensive margins, rather than the intensive margin (Volpe Martincus and Carballo, 2008) . In principle, established exporters already know how to penetrate foreign markets. Non-exporters face higher information barriers, and the literature has shown that this is an important margin on which TPO programs can exhibit high returns (Lederman et al., 2016) . Arguably, the global disruptions in supply chains due to the pandemic have increased the information needs for established exporters. In contrast, the focus on medium rather than small firms is less surprising. 1 To be able to penetrate foreign markets, scale is important and small firms may fall short by definition in this aspect. Second, they help us understand the responses of TPOs during the pandemic and how differences in budget can help explain how TPOs adapted. For example, the fall in marketing activities expenditures in low-income countries is probably linked to the slow adoption of virtual tools and the absence of a recovery plan being put in place at the beginning of the pandemic. This in turn may be explained by the much smaller budgets of TPOs in low-income countries. Finally, they provide a first look at what the post-COVID TPO world may look like, with virtual tools being more prominent.",

Combining the information on budgets and number of employees, we find that the differences across TPOs in terms of budget per employee are large but not as striking. This is because high-income countries tend to have larger budgets but also a significantly larger number of employees. The median TPO budget per employee is USD 118,000. TPOs in high-income countries have a budget per employee of USD 202,000, whereas that budget is USD 57,000 in low-income countries, USD 61,000 in lower-middle-income countries and USD 108,000 in upper-middle-income countries. Considering the critiques of the earlier literature (Hogan et al., 1991) that TPOs' inefficiencies in the 1980s were explained by the fact that they were not sufficiently funded and too bureaucratic, these numbers suggest that TPOs in high-income countries may have overcome these problems to a larger extent than TPOs in low-income countries.",

        "text": "These differences in terms of budget, number of employees, and budget per employee suggest that the capacity to adapt during the COVID pandemic is unlikely to be homogeneous across TPOs. Those with a larger budget and number of employees may have significantly larger margins to adapt to a crisis. This is something we explore in section 5. Note: The box plot represents the Inter-Quartile range (IQ), i.e, observations with values in the 25 to 75 percentile range. The line in the middle of the box represents the median value. The whiskers indicate the 1.5 IQ range above and below the box. If all observations in either the top or bottom whisker are within 1.5 IQ, then the corresponding whisker shortens to the maximum value within the 1.5 IQ range. The distribution across Income groups is very similar, with only lower-middle-income countries having a larger share of board members from the private sector of around 57 percent. Also, it is interesting to note that in the case of high-income countries the IQ range (i.e., the box) includes 0 percent, suggesting that for those countries more than 25 percent of TPOs have no private sector representation on their boards. This suggests that a significant share of high-income countries do not have any private sector representation on their board, which is not the case in low-and middle-income countries. Upper-middle-income countries also followed with a 35 percent increase in the median budget. However, the same was not observed in low-income and lower-middle-income countries where the median TPO budget remained at levels similar to those observed in 2020. A potential explanation for these trends is differences in fiscal space. Low-income countries with little fiscal space may have had no choice but to reduce TPO budgets. To explore this, we correlated changes in total government expenditure (using IMF data) with changes in TPO budgets and found a small positive coefficient, but that is not statistically significant, suggesting that this may not be the main rationale behind changes in TPO budgets during the pandemic. IQ, then the corresponding whisker shortens to the maximum value within the 1.5 IQ range. Export support services are a smaller expenditure item. More than half of TPOs report spending less than 10 percent on export support services both in 2019 and 2021. Only 10 percent of TPOs spend more than 50 percent on export support services both in 2019 and 2021. Overall there has not been a major shift in the distribution of the share of expenditure on export support services during the COVID pandemic.",

A potential explanation for this is that the shift towards virtual marketing tools was not as pronounced in TPOs located in low-income and lower-middle-income countries due to their lower digitalization penetration. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, the distribution may not have contracted as much because in-person marketing activities that have been difficult during COVID may have been replaced by virtual marketing activities.",

There was significantly less use of virtual tools by TPOs in low-income countries, with an adoption of virtual tools that varies between 25 percent and 75 percent depending on the tool, compared to high-income countries where the share of TPOs that adopted virtual tools varies between 50 and 100 percent depending on the tool. Middle-income countries tend to have a range of adoption of virtual tools in between the range for high and low-income countries. All TPOs in high-and lower-middle-income countries have adopted virtual B2B matching events. The corresponding figure in low-and upper-middle-income countries is 75 percent.

Individual firm trade missions, trade logistics and help desks were the virtual activities with less demand. Only 6 percent of TPOs reported those as the activity with the largest number of applicants. Interestingly, in terms of expenditure shares the ranking slightly differs. Training on ecommerce is not among the top three virtual activities. Only slightly more than 10 percent of TPOs report training on e-commerce as having the largest expenditure share. Note that mentoring on e-commerce and training on online platforms are also among the activities with the lowest expenditure shares. This suggests that there was a strong demand for e-commerce training during COVID, and that this does not require large expenditures. The expenditure share that was more frequently reported as being the largest across TPOs was virtual trade fairs with a quarter of TPOs reporting it as the highest expenditure share. Figure 16 shows how the largest number of applications by virtual program varied across TPOs in the four income groups. In high-and upper-middle-income countries the distribution across virtual programs is relatively uniform. In low-and lower-middle-income countries the distribution is sparser, reflecting the fact that in those countries the share of TPOs offering any virtual programs was lower. In terms of type of exporters, there was an increased focus on non-exporting firms, as well as new or occasional exporters. Also, there was a shift towards small and large firms and away from medium-sized firms. A large majority of TPOs had a COVID recovery plan in place or in progress. A large variety of virtual programs were put in place. Virtual trade fairs, B2B matching events and training on e-commerce are the more frequent activities observed across TPOs. The largest number of firm applications were observed in these three virtual activities. Notably, the share of expenditures of training on e-commerce is small, suggesting that it is a popular and inexpensive program.

As with many other institutions there are important differences in TPOs depending on the country's income level. We focus here on the comparison of TPOs in high-and low-income countries where differences are more striking. The median TPO budget in high-income countries is 20 times larger than the median TPO budget in low-income countries, and the number of employees in TPOs in high-income countries is 11 times larger, and these differences remain large after controlling for export size. This matters for explaining the differences in adaptive capacity to the COVID shock. In terms of organizational structure, composition of board members, or the extent to which export promotion is a priority in the agency, there are some small differences. The hierarchical structure is stronger in TPOs in high-income countries with a ratio of board members to employees that is more than 8 times smaller than in TPOs in low-income countries. TPOs in high-income countries also tend to have broader mandates, as TPOs in low-income countries tend to prioritize export promotion.

It is 67 and 80 percent of TPOs in lower and upper middle income countries that get 75 to 100 percent of their funding from public sources.5 Adaptation of TPOs during the COVID pandemicThe evolution of TPOs' budgets around the COVID pandemic shows some interesting patterns. The top panel ofFigure 8shows the distribution of TPOs' budgets during the period 2018-2021, and the bottom panel decomposes the distribution by income group.In the top panel the distribution seems to be quite stable across years, but the median budget declined in 2020 as the pandemic emerged. This is only marginally visible from the top panel ofFigure 8because of the scale of the y-axis, but the median budget is around USD 3.2 million before and after the global pandemic lockdowns (2018, 2019, and 2021) and only USD 2.7 million in 2020. The bottom panel shows that this pattern is mainly driven by a drop in the median as well as the entire distribution of TPOs' budgets in low-income countries. Interestingly, the bottom panel also shows that there was a significant increase in the median TPO budget of high-income countries in 2021 (more than 50 percent), suggesting an intensified effort by TPOs in high-income countries as lockdown measures eased."

Around 60 percent of TPOs spend less than 10 percent on country image activities both in 2019 and 2021. Similarly, only 10 percent of TPOs spend more than 50 percent on country image activities in both years. Thus, country image activities represents a small share of expenditures in most TPOs, and this did not change with the COVID pandemic.Marketing activities are by far the largest expenditure item of TPOs both in 2019 and 2021. But the distribution of shares in marketing shifted to the left between 2019 and 2021 as seen in the top panel in Figure 9, suggesting a contraction in the relative importance of marketing in TPOs' expenditure. In 2019 around 33 percent of TPOs had a share of marketing expenditures that was larger than 50 percent. By 2021 the share of TPOs with marketing expenditures above 50 percent had almost halved to 18 percent of the total TPOs in the sample."

The top panel shows the distribution of expenditures on each of these sectors across all TPOs, and the bottom panel focuses on the distribution of expenditures on electronics across income groups.The top panel indicates that electronics and agriculture are important sectors for TPOs before and after COVID relative to IT services and tourism, which are generally much smaller expenditure items. Around 33 percent of TPOs spent more than 50 percent on the electronics sector in 2019 while for the agriculture sector the corresponding share was 19 percent of TPOs, for IT services it was 10 percent and for tourism it was 2 percent. The share of TPOs spending more than 50 percent on the electronics sector dropped to 18 percent by 2021, while the share of TPOs spending more than 50 percent on the other three sectors was not significantly affected.The bottom panel shows the distribution of the share of expenditures on the electronic sector by income group. The contrast between high and low-income countries is perhaps not surprising. All TPOs in low-income countries spend less than 10 percent on the electronics sector, with almost 80 percent of low-income countries' TPOs reporting no support to the electronics sector both in 2019 and 2021. In high-income countries only 60 percent of TPOs report spending less than 10 percent on the electronics sector, and only 22 percent on highincome countries TPOs report not supporting the electronics sector both in 2019 and 2021."

We distinguish between three types of exporters: established exporters, new or occasional exporters, and non-exporters. The top panel shows that TPOs' expenditure on non-exporters is relatively rare. Around 70 percent of TPOs report spending less than 10 percent on non-exporters both in 2019 and 2021. The share of TPOs that spent more than 50 percent on non-exporters doubled between 2019 and 2021, but still represents a small share of the TPOs in the sample in 2021 (12 percent). The expenditure on new or occasional exporters is slightly larger.More than 15 percent of TPOs report spending more than 50 percent on new and occasional exporters in both years, and \"only\" around 35 percent of TPOs spend less than 10 percent on new and occasional exporters. By far the largest expenditures focus on established exporters.Around 40 percent of TPOs report spending more than 50 percent on established exporters, and the pandemic brought a a slight decrease in that share of TPOs.In the bottom panel ofFigure11 we report the distribution of TPOs' expenditures on established exporters by income group. There are some interesting differences. In highincome countries the share of TPOs spending more than 50 percent on established exporters is almost 70 percent in 2021. In low-income countries the same share is 20 percent, while it is 28 percent in lower-middle-income countries and 23 percent in upper-middle-income countries. Interestingly the distribution of this share shifts to the right between 2019 and 2021 in high-income countries, whereas it shifts to the left in other income groups. Thus, there is a much higher concentration of expenditures on established exporters in high-income countries, and the focus on established exporters increased between 2019 and 2021 in highincome countries, whereas it tended to decline in other income groups. There are two potential explanations for why TPOs focus their efforts on established exporters rather than new or potential exporters where returns are larger. The perhaps more obvious reason is a political economy explanation. Established exporters have better connections and have therefore better access to TPO programs -see box 5.4 in WorldBank (2022). An alternative explanation is that TPOs are risk-averse, and focusing on established exporters is less risky. Arguably, the COVID shock reduced the perceived risk of investing in new or potential exporters as more established exporters were unable to trade. The fact that TPOs in high-income countries moved further towards established exporters, while TPOs in low-income countries moved towards new and potential exporters, suggests that the stronger focus on established exporters in low-income countries is perhaps better explained by risk-aversion in low-income countries. TPO's incentives schemes and key performance indicators could perhaps address risk aversion in low-income countries."

These shares were almost unchanged during the COVID pandemic, but there was a small shift of the distribution of expenditures on medium-sized firms to the left in 2021, signaling a smaller focus on medium-sized firms, that was compensated by a shift of the distribution of expenditures on large firms, signaling a larger focus by TPOs on these firms.

First, let us focus on TPOs characteristics. TPOs are not large agencies: the median TPO has a USD 5 million budget and 49 employees. However, there are large differences across countries: a quarter of TPOs have a budget larger than USD 26.5 million and more than 193 employees while another quarter of TPOs have a budget smaller than USD 1.6 million and fewer than 21 employees. These differences remain large even after controlling for export size. The median TPO has a budget that represents 0.05 percent of exports, with a quarter of TPOs having a budget that represents less than 0.02 percent and a quarter having a budget that represents more than 0.09 percent of exports.A large majority of TPOs are semi-autonomous agencies, while the second most frequent organizational structure is sub-units of ministries, and joint public-private or fully private entities represent around 15 percent of TPOs. But most TPOs are publicly funded. The board of the median TPO has a ratio of board members per employee of 0.15 with 43 percent of the board members representing the private sector. The large majority of TPOs have export promotion as a top priority or only responsibility of the agency. In terms of expenditure, the largest share is spent on marketing activities, with export support services and country image activities significantly behind, followed by research and other activities. TPOs focus their support on medium-sized established exporters. Only a small fraction of TPOs report large expenditure shares on new and occasional exporters, and even less on non-exporting firms. Similarly a small share is spent on small exporters and even less on large exporters. Second, let us focus on TPOs' response to the COVID pandemic. There was a 19 percent decline in the budget of the median TPO in 2020. By 2021 the budget of the median TPO bounced back to 2019 levels. Differences in expenditure by type of activity between 2019 and 2021 are negligible, but we observe a small decrease in marketing activities and a small increase in research activities. Sectoral expenditures suggest a small decrease in the focus on electronics, but otherwise the distribution of expenditures across sectors remained stable. 6"
