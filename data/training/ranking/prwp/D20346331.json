This is particularly relevant if traditional norms provide men with preferential access to key household resources through inheritance and if females attach higher values to family needs or children's welfare and thus devote more of the resources at their disposal to these (Behrman 1990; Strauss et al. 2000) . In this case, the level of female wealth, including assets received via inheritance, is likely to affect future generations' human capital investment, social mobility (Davies 1982; De Nardi 2004; Kotlikoff and Summers 1980) , occupational choice, and asset accumulation (Cowell 1998) . In fact, the potentially far-reaching effect of legal provisions regarding divorce (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006) or access to political office (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004) on female empowerment in the long term is well documented in the literature.",

But results have often been mixed. In Ghana, legal changes seems to have triggered compensatory action that in the end made intended beneficiaries worse off (La Ferrara and Milazzo 2012) . In Rwanda, changes in inheritance legislation became effective on a large scale only once they were combined with a systematic land registration program (Ali et al. 2014) . In India, some states started to amend the Hindu Succession Act as early as 1987 to make women's inheritance rights equal to those enjoyed by men. This was subsequently adopted on a national scale in 2005. One study finds that, in early adopting states, women's likelihood of inheriting land increased and indicators of female empowerment such as girls' educational attainment and age at marriage improved (Deininger et al. 2013) . But others find that reforms may have led to compensatory behavior (Roy 2013) or, by making it more costly to raise girls relative to boys, even have reduced girls' survival ratios (Rosenblum 2012 ).",

We compare the nature and magnitude of first-generation effects of inheritance reform to second-generation effects by mothers who directly benefited from the reforms treating their daughters differently than those who were unaffected. Such second-generation effects are identified by comparing outcomes for females relative to their male siblings in the same household between households where the mother was or was not affected by reform. To do so, we use data for three generations of individuals in three Indian states, one of which implemented inheritance reforms in 1994. Outcome variables include educational inputs, particularly time spent studying, parents' educational spending, primary or secondary completion, and health outcomes. Size and significance of second-generation effects can be compared to first-generation impacts on young girls whose mother was unaffected. Beyond evidence in support of significant second-generation effects, we also find that the magnitude of such effects may well exceed that of first-generation impacts.",

        "text": "To assess whether second-generation effects are plausible and to trace channels through which they might materialize, we complement evidence on second-generation effects with exploration of HSAA-induced impacts on the parent generation. Although the identification strategy is less robust than that for second-generation impacts, we find that females who benefited from inheritance reform in this generation received more assets at marriage and were more empowered in terms of time use, access to bank accounts and sanitary facilities. Their reproductive choices also differed markedly from those by women who had not benefited from reform, in terms of significantly lower fertility and higher survival rates for daughters, though we also find evidence of the HSAA resulting in a lower share of females born, possibly through sex-selective abortion. This supports the notion that early amendments of the HSAA affected long-term outcomes for women, including the next generation's welfare and that improving inheritance rights can be a sustainable way for female empowerment.",

Section 2 reviews evidence of asset transfers across generations; describes legal provisions regarding inheritance in India, including the Hindu Succession Act Amendment (HSAA); and discusses the data. Section 3 introduces issues of identification and presents results for second-generation impacts of the HSAA using a triple difference for education and health outcomes as well as some alternative strategies. Section 4 complements this with estimation of (first-generation) effects on generation II with regard to education completion, time allocation, and female empowerment using a less robust identification strategy. Section 5 concludes by drawing out implications for research and policy.",

        "text": "Although inheritance of key assets including land is likely to be an important determinant of women's bargaining power, empirical studies to assess the direct or indirect impact of inheritance reform are few and often weakly identified. Legal amendments to change female inheritance rights in India are an exogenous source of variation that has been used in a number of studies to assess first-generation reform impacts. Extending such investigation to include second-generation effects is justified to assess whether, over and above direct effects in terms of resource transfers, inheritance reform can, possibly through its effect on empowerment, have a sustained impact beyond the immediate beneficiaries. To identify impacts of inheritance reforms on outcomes in terms of education and health, we use variation in whether or not the mother benefited from the HSAA and compare females to their male siblings in the same household controlling for direct resource transfers received by their mother. This is complemented with evidence on first-generation effects on education, access to a bank account, and fertility.",

The 1956 Hindu Succession Act (HSA) distinguishes individual property from joint ancestral assets which include land (Agarwal 1994) . The fact that rights to the latter are limited to a group -the coparcenary-that comprises only males severely limits females' ability to inherit joint property. 2 To eliminate the gender inequality inherent in this practice, a number of states amended this Act by passing substantively similar amendments -refereed as Hindu Succession Act Amendments or HSAA-starting from 1987. This stipulated that coparceners' daughters will acquire coparcenary rights by birth, 3 thereby making their status equal to that of sons. While the HSAA was adopted at a national level in 2005, the fact that early amendments were adopted only by a select set of states and that in 2011 when our survey was conducted children in non-reform states were still too young to have benefited from the HSAA in any meaningful way thus allows us to explore whether changes in inheritance legislation improved access to physical and human capital by women who were the intended beneficiaries from such legislation.",

Use of repeated cross sections suggests that the reforms may have given rise to compensatory behavior in the sense that they increased educational attainment but reduced the likelihood of girls inheriting land (Roy 2013) . 4 Yet, the finding that, for landowning households, inheritance reform reduced girls' survival ratios, possibly by making it more relatively costly to raise girls vs. boys (Rosenblum 2012) pointstowards potential unintended second-generation effects.

Compared to male siblings, the HSAA is estimated to have led adolescent females to increase the amount of time spent on productive work by more than 30%, mainly by reducing time spent on schooling and household chores. 11 Though low historically (Fulford 2014) , returns to female secondary education in India seem to have increased recently (Jensen 2012) but girls' awareness of these may still not widespread enough to have affected decisions (Chari and Maertens 2014; Jensen 2010) . Interestingly, the HSAA is estimated to have had a strong and significant second-generation effect in the opposite direction, possibly because mothers are cognizant of non-monetary (empowerment) benefits from higher levels of secondary education. In households where the mother had benefited from the HSAA, females spent some 34% more on study (col. 7) and 12% less on household chores (col. 4) than male siblings if other factors are controlled for. Having a mother who benefited from the reform more than doubles the amount of time spent studying by girls compared to their brothers, highlighting the importance of second-generation effects. The positive and large coefficient on the share of endowments brought into the marriage by women also suggests that, in addition to the intangible effect of female empowerment through inheritance reform, access to tangible assets affects intra-household decisions on allocation of educational resources in important ways. The pattern found for education is mirrored by that for productive work where a strong and positive direct reform effect is to some extent countered by indirect effects in the opposite direction for girls from mothers who benefited from the HSAA.",

There is also evidence of a positive direct reform effect and a positive education gap between mother and father reinforces this tendency. The highly significant and negative coefficient on 'female' in cols. 5 and 6 suggests that, surprisingly, mothers are more likely to expend resources on education of boys rather than girls.

At the same time, we find evidence of a significant and large (point estimate of -28%) direct effect of being affected by the HSAA on completing secondary education. This is partly countered by an indirect effect (point estimate of 13% to 9%) of having a mother who benefited from inheritance reform. This, together with the significant and large coefficient on the share of assets brought to the marriage by the mother (0.32) and a smaller coefficient the mother-father education gap, suggests that mothers' rather than their daughters' empowerment is a key driver underlying equalization of opportunities related to secondary education between girls and boys.",

Evidence of first-round effects of inheritance reform on female empowerment in the parent generation via assets received at marriage, females' access to own bank accounts and sanitary facilities, and fertility decisions support the plausibility of such effects. While the share of daughters born to females who benefited from reforms appears to have decreased, survival rates by daughters increased as a result of inheritance reform.

At a global level, understanding of longer-term impacts of such a measure will help appreciate the potential and limitations of inheritance reform, compared to other measures and policies, as a means to promote gender equity. For India, an ability to more precisely gauge HSAA-induced benefits will affect the social desirability of measures to more actively disseminate this piece of legislation or support and monitor its implementation. While assessing the extent to which the results found here carry over to other settings, including in North Indian states would be of interest. The findings suggest that, as key determinants of intergenerational resource transmission, the norms and legislative provision governing inheritance offer considerable potential to promote sustained female empowerment.

While point estimates of the relevant secondary education is positive for females, compared to being negative for males, neither is significant.For assets brought into the marriage (equation 4), table 7 presents results for young and old age groups as defined above in cols. 1-2 and 3-4, respectively. Estimates point towards a HSAA-induced increase in the level of assets brought into the marriage by females of about 50% (point estimates are 0.584 in col. 1 and 0.484 in col. 3, depending on the age cut-off used), compared to no appreciable change in the amount of assets contributed by husbands. To the extent that the share of assets brought into the marriage will affect individuals' future bargaining power, this would be consistent with the notion that the HSAA empowered direct female beneficiaries, thus increasing the plausibility of downstream second-generation effects. ) and increased time for leisure by roughly the same amount (cols. 5 & 6). The fact that results remain robust to inclusion of direct asset transfers and education suggests that this is over and above any HSAA-induced effects via direct transfers of human or physical capital. The interpretation of this being attributable to shifts in intra-household bargaining power is supported by coefficients in panel B which suggest that males whose wives benefited from reforms as defined above spent more time on household chores, although the magnitude of the estimated effect remains modest.Results for the likelihood of females having a bank account or the household having a sanitary latrine in table 9 suggest that the HSAA increased the likelihood of females having an individual bank account by around 4% (4.8% for the base specification and 3.8% for the augmented one). Households where the female spouses had benefited from the HSAA were also by 11 to 13 percentage points more likely to have sanitary latrines, a good that is strongly preferred by women(Stopnitzky 2014). This is consistent with an intra-household externality whereby lack of authority may preclude women's preferences from translating into action similar to what was found elsewhere for cook-stoves(Miller and Mobarak 2013), suggesting that external forces that empower women may help translate preferences into action, It has been suggested that, even if it improves outcomes for girls who are alive, the HSAA may affect reproductive choices and female mortality. To test for such effect, data on the number of children and the share born to 717 female spouses aged 15-60 in our sample as well as their sons' and daughters' survival",
