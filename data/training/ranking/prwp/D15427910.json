        "text": "While crises are periods of intensified adjustment, firm-level evidence on the impact of crises on resource allocation is limited. Moreover, their impact is theoretically uncertain. The idea that crises may accelerate the Schumpetarian (1939) process of creative destruction by \"cleansing\" out unproductive arrangements and freeing up resources for more productive uses features prominently in macro-models (see e.g. Hall, 1995 , Caballero & Hammour, 1994 and Gomes et al., 1997) . On the other hand, some recent papers suggest that, rather than being cleansing, crises \"scar\" the economy and undermine long-run productivity growth by exacerbating market imperfections and destroying productive firms (see Barlevy, 2002, and Ouyang, 2009) . Which view is correct matters for policy, since at issue is whether or not there is a tradeoff between minimizing the short-term impact of crises and maximizing long-run growth prospects; if crises are cleansing policies to dampen short-term impacts may obstruct long-run recovery and be not only costly, but also counterproductive. By contrast, if crises are scarring, policies to minimize short-term impacts are consistent with maximizing long-run growth prospects (see Paci et al., forthcoming) . Given the critical role of the reallocative process in facilitating recovery and growth, and the paucity of available firm-level studies on the impact of crises on resource allocation, empirically discriminating between these competing paradigms is important. This paper uses plant-level manufacturing census data from Indonesia to examine the impact of the East Asian crisis on the process of creative destruction. Aggregate productivity growth decompositions help assess macro-level trends in the contributions of entry, exit and reallocation to productivity growth during and after the crisis. These decompositions are a prelude to firm-level analysis of exit and employment growth patterns, which assesses whether and how firm dynamics during the crisis were different from those operating in pre-and postcrisis periods. Thus, we examine both the impact of the crisis on resource allocation and the reallocative process itself.",

        "text": "Previous work on allocative efficiency has largely avoided periods of crisis, and work on crises has rarely examined firm responses. By using firm-level data to examine the impact of a major crisis on resource allocation this paper combines and contributes to several strands of literature that have evolved fairly separately up until this point. The available evidence on the impact of crises on resource allocation typically relies on aggregate data. The few previous attempts to empirically validate the predictions of the cleansing paradigm using firm-level datadiscussed in detail in section 2 -have either failed to examine changes in the reallocative process itself or suffer methodological shortcomings. Second, existing plant-level studies of reallocation dynamics have demonstrated that business cycles are important determinants of both the pattern and pace of reallocation (see the surveys by Bartelsman & Doms, 2000 , Caves, 1998 , and Syverson, 2010 but typically deliberately exclude crisis-periods. It is therefore not clear to what extent the conclusions based on them generalize to crisis times. Third, cross-country studies based on aggregate data suggest that plant-dynamics are a key determinant of the depth and duration of crises (Bergoeing et al. 2005, Collier and Goderis 2009) , but do not examine how these dynamics matter. Fourth, micro-studies of the impact of crises on labor market outcomes mostly rely on household and labor market data (see e.g. McKenzie 2003 McKenzie , 2004 Fallon & Lucas, 2002; Manning, 2000 , Beegle et al. 1999 , which are ill-suited for analyzing the impact of crises on reallocation dynamics and labor demand. Firm-level data are better suited for this purpose and enable us to document heterogeneity in firm vulnerability and adjustment patterns.",

In addition, our analysis may be relevant for those concerned with the impact of transitions to democracy, such as those currently taking place in the Middle East, on private sector dynamics, as we are able to assess whether the regime change that accompanied the crisis differentially impacted firms connected with the Suharto regime. 1 The main findings can be summarized as follows: the data do not unequivocally support the cleansing paradigm. The crisis led to a spike in exit, a slowdown in entry, and excessive employment reallocation. Productive firms on average experienced lower employment losses, but the correlation between productivity and employment growth did not strengthen. Rather than raising the productivity threshold for survival, the crisis was more indiscriminate in terms of the productivity of firms driven out of business. Firms more vulnerable to changing credit market conditions were much more likely to exit during the crisis, but the attenuation of the link between productivity and survival did not increase with vulnerability to changing loan conditions. The attenuation was also not an artifact of reduced entry rates or driven by political transition. The results are robust to excluding firms with connection to the Suharto regime.",

By contrast, the attenuation was particularly pronounced in provinces with comparatively high minimum wages, suggesting that labor regulations obstructed efficiency enhancing reallocation. The effects are not all negative, however. The protective power of productivity against exit was restored post-crisis, and the crisis appears to have weeded out the weakest potential entrants; while entry rates were lower during the crisis, those firms that entered were on average much more productive, which helped mitigate the loss in aggregate productivity.",

Some prominent macro-models predict that recessions may speed up this process by \"cleansing\" out unproductive firms and freeing up resources for more productive uses (see e.g. Caballero & Hammour, 1994 . While longitudinal manufacturing firm-level studies provide empirical evidence that the creative destruction process facilitates productivity growth, they also raise questions about how this process varies over time. Decompositions of aggregate productivity growth only weakly support the hypothesis that allocative efficiency increases during cyclical downturns (see, inter alia, Griliches & Regev, 1995, and Baily et al. 1992 ). Yet such studies typically exclude extreme economic events and it is therefore uncertain whether lessons based on them apply during times of crisis.",

        "text": "In the presence of market imperfections downturns may hamper, rather than facilitate, adjustments, and protract the recovery process (see e.g. Loayza et al., 2005) . Distortionary labor market regulations and policies governing firm dynamics appear particularly detrimental to the efficiency of the reallocative process (see e.g. Collier and Goderis, 2009, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta and Schweiger, 2008) . Barlevy (2002 Barlevy ( , 2003 , moreover, has pointed out that crises can obstruct the process of creative destruction by exacerbating credit market imperfections, which may hurt efficient firms disproportionately as such firms are likely to have higher financing needs, contradicting the creative destruction hypothesis. Empirical evidence supporting the idea that crises exacerbate credit constraints is provided by Blalock, Gertler and Levine (2008) who, using the same dataset as considered in this paper, show that foreign owned firms, which are arguably less vulnerable to liquidity constraints, fared much better during the crisis than comparable domestically owned firms. 2 Discriminating between the competing predictions of the cleansing and scarring paradigms requires firm-level analysis on the impact of crises on resource allocation, as it requires one to analyze the link between productivity, exit and firm growth. Although such analysis is scant, there are a few studies that shed light on the debate. Liu and Tybout (1996) compare the performance of continuing plants and exiting plants in Chile and Colombia from 1980-1985 but find no evidence for systematic covariance of the efficiency gap between these two groups of firms over the business cycle in either country, even though Chile suffered a recession in 1982. Exit rates of Chilean firms only increased modestly during the recession. Casacuberta and Gandelsman (2009) examine the impact of the 2002 banking crises in Uruguay on resource allocation. Even during the crisis, productivity was negatively correlated with exit, although the evidence suggests the crisis may have attenuated the link between productivity and exit somewhat. Nishimura, et al. (2005) use a cohort analysis comparing productivity of entrants and survivors to examine the impact of the Japanese recession on productivity growth and find that the 1996/97 banking crisis induced the exit of some relatively efficient firms among the youngest cohorts. Similarly, Eslava et al. (2010) demonstrate that Colombian firms dependent on external credit were more likely to exit during the 1998-2001 recessions, even if they were highly productive. On the other hand, using manufacturing data from Russia, Brown and Earle (2002) show that the recession induced by the transition from communism to a market based economy coincided with an improvement in the reallocative process.",

After a reduction in FDI flows in response to the depreciation of the Thai Baht, the Rupiah depreciated dramatically, precipitating a sharp increase in inflation rates. Interest rates were raised to defend the currency, which exacerbated the decline in demand. GDP growth contracted severely in 1997, and fell in absolute terms by over 13% in 1998. Manufacturing was one of the first and hardest hit sectors due to its greater reliance on imported inputs, exposure to changes in foreign demand (particularly given the importance of intra-regional trade) and greater reliance on external financing, often in foreign currency, which became an enormous burden post-devaluation. The drop in manufacturing output both preceded and exceeded the drop in aggregate GDP. In fact, the census data suggest that manufacturing suffered its largest decline in 1997 already.",

It has very detailed information on employment, inputs and outputs, industrial classification, exporting, ownership, investment behavior, and the capital stock, which we measure as the replacement value of machinery and equipment at the end of the calendar year. Employment is measured as the average number of workers per day. We augmented the data with industry-level measures of 6 While the Difference and Systems GMM estimators developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) are in principle capable of yielding unbiased estimates, these estimators are not well suited for our data; the difference GMM estimator is likely to result in poorly behaved estimates when variables are highly persistent as is the case with our data (for surviving firms the correlation between lnLt and lnLt-1 is 0.98 -both in crisis and non-crisis years), while the Systems GMM estimators relies on a mean stationarity assumption that is palpably undesirable in the context of a crisis (See Roodman, 2006 , for a discussion). We therefore eschew this approach.",

Measurement error might induce a spurious attenuation in the relationship between productivity and firm survival and employment growth, and could thus bias our regressions against finding evidence for cleansing. Productivity growth decompositions are even more vulnerable to measurement error as they rely on the accurate measurement of both productivity and market share of all firms. To ensure our results are not an artifact of measurement error, we have removed all anomalous observations from our dataset (see the Appendix for a detailed discussion on how anomalous observations were identified). In addition, we conduct a large number of robustness checks, presented in section 6.2 below, including using a range of alternative productivity proxies, focusing exclusively on long-run survival using pre-crisis productivity (to avoid having to rely on measures of productivity obtained during the crisis) and controlling for sector-specific shocks (to check our results are not driven by inappropriate deflators). See the Appendices for more information on the construction of our data and key explanatory variables. The high job losses during the crisis were driven both by a slowdown in job creation and by a spike in job destruction, and predominantly accounted for by employment adjustment by incumbents (see figure 2). The share of job flows accounted for by firm entry and exit is likely to be underestimated, however, since we only observe firms with at least 20 employees. The amount of gross reallocation far exceeded the amount required to achieve net employment adjustment, leading to enormous excess churning. The increase in excess churning attests to the importance of heterogeneity across firms: even during the crisis, almost a third of all firms reported expanding employment. Nevertheless, a striking feature of the data is how persistent employment is; over the entire period considered on average 21% of firms did not change their labor input each year. The figure also shows a longer trend towards lower job creation, both in aggregate and in net creation rates.",

The between term was generally negative, but became less so during the crisis (and was only positive, just, in 1998); the contribution of reallocation of market share from less productive to more productive firms was very modest (though measurement error may bias the between term downwards). The increase in the disproportionate entry term indicates is also indicative of cleansing. Even though there were fewer entrants, they were on average more productive than incumbents and this helped mitigate the overall loss in average productivity. On the other hand, the more negative contribution of exit during the crisis, which was especially pronounced in 1997, suggests that relatively productive firms were more likely to exit, which is indicative of scarring.

Since productivity is very strongly correlated over time (the autocorrelation coefficients on log value added per worker and the Solow residual are .85 and .79 respectively), lagged productivity is a good proxy for current productivity. Moreover, because it is measured during non-crisis times it is arguably less vulnerable to measurement error. While the differences in the protective power of productivity become somewhat smaller, the pattern of results is robust to using these lagged productivity measures. We interpret this as strong evidence that the attenuation effect is genuine and not driven by measurement error.

Labor regulation thus appears to interfere with market selection. Importantly, this distortionary effect is especially pronounced during the crisis; the crisis interaction term between minimum wages and productivity is strongly statistically significant using both log value added per worker and the Solow residual, indicating that relatively productive firms confronted with relatively low reductions in real minimum wages were proportionately more likely to exit. Note also that including this interaction reduces the coefficient on the crisis-productivity interaction term. In other words, labor regulations appear to provide a partial explanation for the attenuation effect.

The results suggest that while entrants\" survival is typically less strongly correlated with productivity, this result was not different during the crisis.

        "text": "Using Indonesian manufacturing census data from 1991-2001 to examine the impact of the East Asian crisis on resource allocation, this paper rejects the hypothesis that the crisis unequivocally improved the reallocative process. Decompositions of aggregate productivity growth reveal that firms that suffered the largest productivity losses also suffered the largest reductions in market share. In addition, market share reallocation between firms contributed more positively to average productivity than during non-crisis times, although the magnitude of this contribution was modest and only positive in absolute terms in 1998. However, the correlation between productivity and employment growth did not strengthen, which is concerning given the excessive amount of job reallocation taking place during the crisis. More worryingly, the link between productivity and exit of existing firms was significantly attenuated during the crisis, suggesting that the crisis was less discriminating in terms of the productivity of firms driven out of business. Fortunately, post-crisis the link between firm survival and productivity was restored suggesting that the crisis did not permanently scar the Schumpetarian process of creative destruction. In addition, although there were fewer entrants, the contributions of entrants rose; the firms that entered were typically more productive than incumbents and this helped mitigate the loss in productivity. In other words, the crisis appears to have weeded out the weakest potential entrants, which helped mitigate the loss in aggregate productivity.",

        "text": "Labor market imperfections more so than credit market imperfections help account for the attenuation effect. Firms in sectors more dependent on external finance and with lower levels of asset tangibility were indeed disproportionately more likely to exit during the crisis. However, controlling for these financial characteristics did not reduce the conditional attenuation effect, suggesting that changing credit market conditions do not account for the attenuated link between productivity and exit. By contrast, labor regulations provide a possible explanation for the attenuation of the link between productivity and firm survival; during the crisis productivity was a relatively less important determinant of survival in provinces with high minimum wages, suggesting that labor regulations possibly distorted the adjustment process. Finally, the attenuation is not a statistical artifact due to a reduction in entry, nor is it driven by firms that had been able to achieve high profits by virtue of their connections with Suharto being differentially impacted; if anything the crisis induced a cleansing effect amongst these firms.",

        "text": "This work has focused on the impact of the East Asian crisis on Indonesia. As the fourth most populous country and widely portrayed as a \"tiger cub\" with a bright future, understanding the crisis dynamics in Indonesia is of inherent interest. Focusing on a developing country may be testing the cleansing hypothesis in a context where it is more likely to be rejected. However, with crises more prevalent in developing countries, this can be a particularly relevant case to examine. The shock that hit Indonesia was also large --although the recent financial crisis shows that far more developed countries have not been immune to significant financial shocks. Assessing the extent to which our findings generalize to other crisis-episodes is a promising area for further research. 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Exit rate Entry rate 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 6 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 -entry and exit are defined as entry into the survey and exit from the survey (see the Appendix) -entry and exit statistics are based on the raw data; all other statistics are based on the sample that excludes outliers (1) 7.787 7.991 7.996 Exiting (2) 7.417 7.786 7.509 Difference (1) (2) 0.370*** 0.205*** 0.487*** ln (V/L) (demeaned by sector) All -0.133 0.070 0.112 Surviving 1-0.110 0.093 0.079 Exiting 2-0.395 -0.119 -0.299 Difference (1) (2) 0.284*** 0.212*** 0.378*** ln (V/L) (demeaned by sector-year) All 0.000 0.000 0.000 Surviving (1) 0.022 0.023 0.031 Exiting 2-0.256 -0.184 -0.351 Difference (1) (2) 0.278*** 0.206*** 0.383*** TFP -Solow All 2.277 2.483 2.400 Surviving (1) 2.281 2.475 2.348 Exiting (2) 2.230 2.557 2.357 Difference (1) (2) 0.051*** -0.082*** -0.009",

In 2001, BPS changed the classification of plants from the second revision of the ISIC to the third. A consistent bridge between these different coding systems was constructed based upon the inclusion of both codings in the dataset for the 2000 survey database. This bridge was corroborated using a bridge provided by BPS. In many cases, the industry code provided in the dataset was truncated to four or fewer digits. Where possible, if an adjacent year\"s reported industry for the same firm was available that was used to fill in the truncated digits. Where plants produce multiple products or the production processes allow changing from one product to another, we may expect to see the coded industry of production change from year to year. In such cases, the mode sector code is used (with ties going to the initial sector code reported).Total labor for an establishment was defined as average number of production and nonproduction workers per working day (in a given year). This measure comprises including both temporary and permanent workers as well as paid and unpaid workers. BPS defines production workers as workers who work directly in the production process or activities connected with this process. All other workers are classified as and non-production. These definitions roughly correspond to traditional definitions of blue-and white-collar workers, respectively (see below).Blue collar workers the average number of all production and unpaid workers used per working day.White collar workers: the average number of all non-production workers used per working day.Unskilled ratio. the share of blue collar workers (including unpaid production workers) as a proportion of the total establishment employment.The establishment-level total wage bill was constructed as the sum of cash wages/salary and inkind benefits for production and non-production workers deflated to 1993 rupiah using the national consumer price index obtained from the World Development Indicators.Capital is measured as the estimated value of machinery and equipment at December 31 of the year in question. Where the estimated value was not available, the book value was used as provided. These values were deflated to 1993 rupiah values on an annual basis using a price deflator based on Wholesale Price Indices for new machinery and equipment. The manufacturing survey does not include data on the value of the capital stock for 1996. We imputed capital stock for 1996 using contemporaneous output, material inputs, labor usage, ownership characteristics, a dummy for whether or not a firm invested interacted with the amount it invested, whether or not the firm exports, province and lagged capital for 1991-1995. Using the same set of explanatory variables we backcasted capital for firms that entered in 1996.Materials were defined using the total reported value of raw materials used by the firm during the calendar year. These were deflated to 1993 rupiah using sector-specific deflators based on Wholesale Price Indices provided to us by Peter Brummund weighted by the relevant input share obtained from the OECD Input-Output Table Databases for 1995 and 2000 (for the period  1990-1995 we used the 1995 input-output table, for 2000 and 2001 we used the 2001 output  table and for the years 1995-2000 we constructed input-output tables based on linear interpolation between the 1995 and 2000 tables).Gross output/Good produced was measured as the total value of goods produced during the calendar year, deflated by 2 digit sector-specific GDP deflators constructed on the basis of Wholesale Price Indices provided to us by Peter Brummund.Value-added was measured as goods produced during the calendar year minus materials used to produce them.Firm age was constructed using the difference between the survey year and the year the firm reported the \"start of commercial production\". Note that this year need not coincide with the year the plant first appeared in the survey (because of the size requirement of having at least 20 employees).Sector characteristics: 3-digit ISIC revision 3 industry-level measures for financial dependence, turnover, the natural rate of entry are based on those presented in Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Micco and Pages (2004) . Note that these proxies are based on US industries.The financial dependence measure is computed using Standard and Poor\"s Compustat database. It is the industry-level median of the ratio of capital expenditures minus cash flow over capital expenditures. The numerator and denominator are summed over all years for each firm before dividing (to minimize measurement error). Cash flow is defined as the sum of funds from operations, decreases in inventories, decreases in receivables, and increases in payables. Capital expenditures include net acquisitions of fixed assets.Liquidity Needs: Following Raddatz (2006) we use the industry level median of the inventories to sales ratio over the period 1991-2001 as our proxy for liquidity needs.Natural rate of entry is measured as the mean number of new firms between periods t-1 and t , divided by number of firms in period t, by two digit SIC code for the United States over the period [1963] [1964] [1965] [1966] [1967] [1968] [1969] [1970] [1971] [1972] [1973] [1974] [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] . Source: Table 5 in Dunne et al (1988) .Tangibility: we use Braun (2003) \"s indicators of asset tangibility, which he defines as the median tangibility of all active U.S. based companies in the industry as contained in Computstat\"s annual industrial files, where tangibility is defined as net property, plant and equipment divided by the book value of assets.Turnover (Excess employment reallocation) is defined as the sum of job creation and job destruction at 4 digit SIC code, minus the absolute value of net job creation. As with job reallocation, we compute the time average of the annual measures. Time average by sector for period 1973-1993. Source: Job Flows data Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) .Exporters were identified based upon reporting that the share of output exported was nonzero and nonmissing, In 1997, the number of firms that reported to export was implausibly low and the export variable was interpolated by defining firms to be exporters if they had been exporters in both the previous and the subsequent year. Firms that exited in 1998 were considered to be exporters in 1997 if they had been exporting in 1996, while firms that entered in 1997 and reported exporting in 1998 were also considered exporters in 1997.Foreign owned firms are all firms that have 10 percent or more foreign ownership.Government owned firms are firms that have any local or national government ownership.Entry is defined as the first year an establishment is observed in the data. Firms may have been in operation for several years prior to crossing the minimum threshold of 20 employees to be included in the survey. Firm exit is defined as permanent exit from the dataset. Note that, since the survey only includes firms with 20 or more employees, firms whose employment falls below this threshold will be defined as having exited in case they do not reappear in the data Minimum Wages provincial real monthly minimum wage, obtained from the World Bank (forthcoming).Connected, Suharto Dummy variable taking the value 1 if a firm had a relative of Suharto on its board. See Mobaraq and Purbasari (2008) for details.Connected, JSX Dummy variable for connectedness with the Suharto regime constructed by Mobaraq and Purbasari (2008) . Building on Fisman (2001) they identify firms traded on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (henceforth JSX) whose stock returns responded negatively to newsreports about Suharto\"s health. They moreover identify the major shareholders on the boards of these firms, and all conglomerates run by these entrepreneurs, as well as firms owned by these conglomerates and classify those as connected too.Connected (JSX/Suharto) The maximum of connected, JSX and Connected, Suharto.",
