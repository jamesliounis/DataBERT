        "text": "The adoption by the Russian Federation of a deposit insurance system (DIS) in late 2003 was a significant development, although certainly not a novelty by international standards. 2 The discussion of the proposal in Parliament took quite some time because it was not seen initially as a priority issue and, possibly, due to the resistance from industry groups well represented in Parliament. The government did not press either because it feared assuming the contingent liabilities resulting from the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme. Additional concerns included the intrinsic difficulties of setting up a new agency and its insurance fund, taking away functions initially vested in the Central Bank of Russia, the opposition of commercial banks to the new insurance fee, and the opposition of some vested interests, including the public banks and particularly Sberbank-which until a few years ago had almost a complete monopoly of retail deposits in Russia. The arguments offered in defense of the DIS focused on (i) greater public confidence in financial institutions and the potentially positive impact on the country's financial and macroeconomic stability; (ii) the need to protect small depositors; and (iii) the benefits of leveling the playing field between the different classes of banks, particularly private and public, thereby bolstering competition in the financial sector. Especially the small Russian regional banks, it was then argued, needed to strengthen their competitive position given their perceived importance in improving access to finance and financial deepening.",

In addition, the adoption of a DIS also has potential implications for the conduct of monetary policy and the design of other institutional mechanisms, in particular the central bank's lender of last resort facilities, as well as its impact on the risks faced by it as supervisory agency. The DIS may allow banks to substitute deposit insurance for capital or, put in a different form, take more risks for the same level of capital. 3 The objective of this paper is not to review the pros and cons of deposit insurance systems, but to focus, rather narrowly, on the recent adoption of the DIS in Russia, the rationale offered, and the potential impact it might have on the stability and development of the Russian banking system.

Further state support can be provided if required. Insurance premiums are uniform for all banks, payable in rubles on a quarterly basis, and assessed on daily averages of insured deposits. The insurance premium cannot exceed 0.15 percent of deposits in the last accounting period (Art. 36). The law stipulates that this premium is due to fall to 0.05 percent once the fund has accumulated the equivalent of 5 percent of the deposit base. The assets collected by the insurance fund can be invested in government paper, bonds, equities of Russian issuers, as well as securities of member states of the OECD.",

A total of 870 out of the 1,097 banks collecting private deposits participate in the DIS, covering 99.2 percent of banking assets. Overall, 1,150 banks filed for licensing under the new law, out of which 824 banks were accepted to participate in the system in a first round of evaluations conducted by the CBR in its capacity as supervisory agency. Four banks withdrew their applications, and a few institutions lost their license to take deposits. Using the appeal procedure provided by the law, 265 banks resubmitted their applications to the DIS. As of January 2006, 931 banks have been admitted to the DIS.

Of this amount, insurance premiums paid by participating banks amounted to 9.8 bn. RUR or 59 percent. The remainder of the funds consisted of contributions from the Russian Federation (6.1 bn. RUR or 36.7 percent), and the investment income of the Deposit Insurance Agency (0.7 bn. RUR or 4.2 percent). 8 Private deposits have grown strongly since the introduction of the DIS, but interestingly, at a lower rate than in previous years (see Fig. 2 ). Individual retail deposits grew faster in the regions outside Moscow, especially in the Urals, Volga, and the Russian Far East. Most of this growth seems to be driven by deposits collected by branches of credit institutions headquartered in Moscow, but it also reflects the emergence of healthy and dynamic regional banks. Since the introduction of the DIS, ruble deposits grew faster than deposits in foreign currency, coinciding with the rapid real appreciation of the ruble vis-\u00e0-vis foreign currencies. With the notable exception of foreign banks, most of the growth in deposits took place via term deposits with maturities between 181 days and 3 years. However, changes in the composition of deposits from sight to term deposits, for example, is less significant in Russia than in other countries because retail deposits can be withdrawn on demand regardless of their contractual maturity. The latter might created unexpected liquidity problems for banks, and it brings a generalized uncertainty of duration gaps at a time when the demand for longer-term funding from consumers and enterprises is on the rise.",

Overall, the banking sector increased its reliance on deposits as a source of funding. The share of deposits among bank liabilities increased from 44.4 percent to 58.5 percent between 2004 and 2005.

This structure is a legacy of both the socialist past-with its large publicly-owned banks-while the fragmentation in the medium and small bank sizes reflects the lax entry policies followed in the early 1990s by the CBR in granting banking licenses, as well as CBR's reluctance to force exits or consolidations by using stricter regulatory standards and higher capital requirements. 10 Yet, the number of deposit-taking banks decreased from 1,239 in 2001 to 1,045 by January 1, 2006.

Many smaller banks are so-called \"pocket banks,\" serving a single company or its controlling financial-industrial group. 12 The five largest banks accounted for 45.1 percent of total bank assets as of early 2005, whereas the top 200 banking institutions represented jointly 89 percent of total assets. Although the majority of banks are privately owned, the state-owned banks control more than 50 percent of banking assets. Sberbank is still by far the largest institution, with 54.1 percent of total retail deposits and about one-third of total loans outstanding. The remaining 20 state banks are much smaller and usually specialize in a particular market niche or region. The only exception is Vneshtorgbank, which accounts for about 6 percent of total bank assets. Nonetheless, the weight and preferences enjoyed by publicly-owned banks are holding back the development of private sector banking in Russia. Banks under foreign control have grown substantially in recent years, but they represent only 7.6 percent of total bank assets.

Yet, this number is the result of the financial sector's impressive growth since the transition to a market economy began, with a major disruption resulting from the 1998 crisis and some turbulence in the summer of 2004. One result of this low penetration rate is that only a limited number of institutions are involved in head-to-head competition for client deposits. Most Russian banks have either a limited geographical focus or are specializing in a niche client base. The same is true for foreign-controlled banks, which have been mainly active in the securities market and a few \"blue chip\" companies, and are only now venturing into consumer lending, which is growing at an exponential rate (270 percent growth since 2004).",

Poor governance, lack of business diversification, portfolio concentration (partly due to related party lending), volatile and concentrated deposits, and poor loan quality are considered to be the primary sources of risks. Such weaknesses are somewhat mitigated by strong economic growth, a reduction in the underground economy, and rapid asset growth, particularly consumer lending.

Doubtful and irrecoverable loans of 1.2 percent of the aggregate loan portfolio, as reported at year-end 2005, are also very likely to be seriously underestimated. All this combined with large credit risks 18 --still amounting to about 70 percent of the aggregate loan portfolio -illustrate well the challenges currently faced by Russian regulators. Source: CBR Banking Supervision report 2005, 2004 and 2003 In an environment like the one described above, deposit insurance can not, by itself, be a panacea and stimulate savings in the domestic banking system. Given the increasing monetization and rapid growth of the Russian economy, financial sector assets are expected to continue growing as they have since the transition began-in spite of the economic crises of 1998 and to a lesser extent 2004, as well as the strong decrease in real interest rates observed since 2000. As the deposit base grows, the rate of growth of deposits will moderate, and in fact has halved since the introduction of the deposit insurance system. With the overwhelming share of retail deposits held by public banks, mainly Sberbank, an implicit state-sponsored insurance guarantee was already in place, creating a market advantage for Sberbank (i.e., flight to \"quality\" of cheaper funds). 16 Although the underlying trend may be clearly be towards a deterioration of credit quality, this apparent surge in sub-standard loans may also reflect a tightening in loan classification rules by the Central Bank of Russia. 17 The new loan classification system increases the number of categories from four to five, setting a range for the loan loss provisions within each category (in parentheses). The 5 risk categories are: Standard (0 percent), Watch (1-20 percent), Substandard (21-50 percent), Doubtful (51-100 percent) and Loss (100 percent). See S&P, Bank Industry Risk Analysis, \"The Russian Federation\", June 28, 2005, page 10. 18 Large credit risks are defined as exposure to a single borrower / group in excess of 5 percent of the lender's capital.",

However, the real challenge has been its execution in view of the ambitious timetable set for the process, CBR's limited capabilities, the information problems faced, and above all, by the limited support offered to the CBR for a strict implementation of the strategy. Nonetheless, some market views seem to be overly negative, suggesting that due to political pressure, the CBR, by accepting an overwhelming majority of banks into the DIS, missed an opportunity to create a dual system of banks comprising those acting as deposit-taking banks and others more closely resembling non-bank financial companies (bearing in mind that nonaccredited banks will lose their right to take deposits from the population).",

Equally troubling are recent proposals being considered by the Duma to gradually increase the coverage ceiling from RUR 100,000 to RUR 300,000 until 2007 and up to RUR 600,000 in the mid-term. 29 Interestingly, these efforts are spearheaded by the DIA with the objective of raising the coverage levels as percentage of GDP under the Russian scheme to international levels and promote more savings. As shown in Figure 6 , 98.5 percent of Russian deposits are currently under the RUR 100,000 limit and therefore insured.

For instance, there is a need to review the approach selected for setting the insurance premium. The premium by law must be uniform for all banks, irrespective of their level of risk, which implies a subsidy of the stronger to the weakest banks, with a \"welfare loss\" from an economic perspective. From our perspective, a much preferable option would include, expost and confidential, rebates on banks' deposit insurance fees paid to the DIF, reflecting lower effective payments for better managed and financially stronger institutions (as measured by CAMEL-type indicators). In this way, incentives of banks, insurers and supervisors would be aligned, avoiding the negative signaling effect (which might precipitate deposit runs) of differential, ex-ante, deposit insurance fees for different types of banks.",

A related issue is the actuarial soundness of the funds given the current level of the premium. 32 Without an adequately capitalized insurance scheme, the likelihood of a future need for a state bail-out will remain substantial. Furthermore, a strategy must be designed for phasing out the blanket guarantee provided by the Russian state in the wake of the 2004 mini-crisis. This blanket guarantee is due to expire at the end of 2006, and an orderly process to prepare for this event is important. 33 Otherwise, the elimination of the blanket guarantee could lead to more turbulence on the Russian banking market with substantial operational implications for the DIA (i.e., liquidation of institutions and a surge in insurance claims). Finally, Russian authorities are well advised to complement the current deposit insurance system with an ambitious financial education and communication initiative. According to an Izvestiia survey in March 2005, only 30 percent of respondents were aware of the existence of the DIS. 34 There is little evidence indicating that this figure has changed substantially.

        "text": "The summer 2004 mini-crisis made clear the tentative trust of the population in the local banking system. It started in May 2004 with the Russian Central Bank's intervention in Sodbiznesbank, a small bank, whose banking license was withdrawn on charges of money laundering because of CBR's limited range of instruments to resolve banks. Shortly afterward, Novocherkassk City Bank, a small regional bank, also lost its license due to charges of money laundering and failure to comply with prudential regulations. Rumors were circulating of a blacklist of weak banks being targeted by the CBR, including even larger institutions, quickly leading to loss of confidence by contagion and acute liquidity shortages at a number of banking institutions. By June, the interbank market had almost entirely dried-up. A number of banks started to have liquidity problems because of increasing withdrawals of deposits. On July 6, Guta Bank, then Russia's 22 nd largest bank, collapsed. As Guta Bank depositors started to have problems withdrawing money at ATMs, rumors of an imminent crisis at Alfa Bank, Russia's largest private bank, spread quickly. Within just three days, panicking depositors withdrew some $160 million from Alfa Bank, or about 12 percent of its retail deposits.21"
